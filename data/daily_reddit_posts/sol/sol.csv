SOL,cryptocurrency,Why Solana sucks ?,"I always see everywhere in DeFi that Solana is garbage. People tell me they prefer Ethereum and Sol won't last cause it's just shit.
  
My question is why?
  
What did i miss? Sol is fast and cheap, and except few network shutdowns it seems to work well.  
Is there a centralized issue? Some weird distribution? Are they just talking about the fact that a lot of shitcoins there can't last more than 10minutes?
  
Please help a crypto veteran that feels like a real noob when it's time to talk about Solana.",342,2024-02-18 22:35:56,795
SOL,cryptocurrency,10 things they don't want people to know or post about about Solana,"1. Bots constantly extract and **front-run users that have slippage.**
2. Transactions fail if you don't have enough slippage, and **users still have to pay for the failures.**
3. The blockchain has at least **12 major outages so far.**
4. Companies that run RPC endpoints can front-run you.
5. Solana has been **officially in beta 4.5 years so far.**
6. To become a **validator** you **need to be extremely wealthy.**
7. Their **TPS is marketed wrong**, it's not 3000 TPS, they include voting and failed transactions in this marketing to fool you, **it's actually about \~250 TPS.**
8. Solana **circulating supply increased by 59.09 million** over the last year which means **they printed $8.5 billion.**
9. Recently there was **a vote passed for validators (the rich) to get 100% of high priority transactions.**
10. **$7.5 billion SOL, is continued to be sold-off by FTX, a major unlock occurs in March 2025, and continued unlocks every month up till 2028.**

TL;DR: I added a comedy flair for ""comedy"" purposes because if someone told you that this is one of the major crypto networks you'd indeed think that crypto is a scam...

SOL,cryptocurrency,"Solend, the largest lending market on Solana is about to have a crippling liquidation of $170m SOL that could crash the network. To prevent this, the decentralized protocol is proposing to seize the user's funds via governance","There is a large liquidation watch on Solana's Solend protocol, where a whale has  deposited 5.7M SOL  ($170M and borrowed 108M USDC and USDT borrowed. This alone accounts for a huge % of borrowing on Solana, and now this position is under a liquidation threat. 

The whale is not closing their position. In most protocols like Compound, or AAVE, Maker etc, this will result in an onchain liquidation. Infact we have seen many such large liquidations on AAVE And Maker recently, and everything has worked as expected. 

However such a large liquidation in an illiquid market and unstable network like Solana is likely to have vastly damaging consequences. Solana network has already gone down and halted half a dozen time. 

The Solend team explains what could happen to the network:

>This  could cause chaos, putting a strain on the Solana network. Liquidators  would be especially active and spamming the liquidate function, which  has been known to be a factor causing Solana to go down in the past.  
>  
>**Letting a liquidation of this size to happen on-chain is extremely risky.**  DEX liquidity isn’t deep enough to handle a sale of this size and could  cause cascading effects. Additionally, liquidators will be incentivized  to spam the network in an effort to win very lucrative liquidations.  This has been known to cause load issues for Solana in the past which  would exacerbate the problems at hand.

So to prevent this, they are proposing to literally steal the user's funds and execute OTC trades:

>Grant  emergency power to Solend Labs to temporarily take over the whale’s  account so the liquidation can be executed OTC and avoid pushing Solana  to its limits. This would be done via a smart contract upgrade.  Emergency powers will be revoked once the whale’s account reaches a safe  level.

When shit starts to implode, all the true colors of decentralization comes out. 

These shitty protocol are run by fly by night cowboys who learnt basics of economics during the bull run. They put their users are risk by running terrible protocols that do not think about all the edge cases...because who cares about risks right?! 

And during signs of distress, they resolve to seize user funds.",11512,2022-06-19 11:17:30,2240

SOL,cryptocurrency,I think Solana is the most over rated crypto and does not deserve a top 5 spot,"Maybe it's just me but I dont see how Solana is so high up the rankings when theres so much controversy around it. The technology is good but aside from that it's an absolute shit coin, another ""ethereum killer"" that will probably die out once the biggest investors sell their bags. 

For starters how can the devs shut down the blockchain because of a glitch then call the platform decentralised? Do you think crypto could of ever come this far if satoshi shut down btc for repairs? Absolute nonsense.

Then there was the discovery of a hidden 12 million coins which wasint disclosed to any investor. 12,000,000× £160 (roughly at the moment)= £1,920,000,000 is a lot of money to hide for no specific reason.

And dont forget the announcement of bringing tether  to their blockchain like that's something to be proud of, everyone in the crypto space knows tether is a liability and could put everyone's investment at risk.

SOL,cryptocurrency,Solana is being wiped out. TVL has crashed to $280m and out of top 10 after losing 67% this month alone. It was close to $1bn at the start of the month. Down 97% from peak,"DeFi on Solana is being wiped out, so to speak. 

At the start of the month, TVL on the chain was close to $1bn. Now it has crashed to $280m and is out of top 10. 

[Top chains by TVL](https://preview.redd.it/0raskafxsy0a1.jpg?width=2756&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16d18b20ac03a626477e0b8a0165746f858f6a07)

At the peak of the bull run, Solana boasted close to $10 BN in TVL. Now it down to 2.8% of that. Absolute carnage.

Solana has been plagued with one disaster after another - first the numerous chain halts, then the revelation that one team was responsible for most of TVL by creating double entries, now the final nail in the coffin has been the implosion of Sam, brining with it the downfall of the chain he shilled so much. Many exchanges are cutting down on exposure to Solana, Even stablecoins are migrating liquidity to other chains

SOL,cryptocurrency,"The $320m Wormhole hack was ""replenished"" by Jump Capital, an institutional trading desk/market maker (similar to Citadel) without any questions. This shows the entire Solana ecosystem is just a sham propped up by institutional entities","Yesterday, the Wormhole bridge one of Solana's biggest bridges lost $320m in a hack. Within hours, a trading desk Jump Capital agreed to replenish the entire amount so that the liquidations calamity is avoided. The loss of the peg due to the hack could have sent the network into cascading liquidations arising out of leveraged positions. In stepped a VC to save the day.

[Lost $320m? Thats fine.. we got you covered. ](https://preview.redd.it/adhsxhuefqf81.jpg?width=1172&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ed759f03c763a7cfd07d8bb35a03cff7aa3921d)

The fact that VCs are ready to cover these kind of losses shows that the entire Solana ""ecosystem"" is just one big sham propped up by these same VCs. They dont want their baby to die just yet. Apparently Jump Capital owns a significant stake in Wormhole and is ready to sink such a huge amount to cover losses. 

In Solana, the top 1.34% of addresses owns 99% of the circulating supply. Most of the supply was sold to early VCs and insiders at a massive discount to retail. Insiders and bad actors like Chamath have publicly joked about using Solana as a vehicle to play their pumps and dumps out, leaving retail to hold the bags when the sham unfolds. 

VCs dont just sink in $300m to save the day, unless they have already taken out 50x that amount - that is what Solana has enabled them to do already.

So a buncha SOL Shills be like hurr durr even ehtirium had hacks and was saved by fork. Well the DAO hack was solved by cryptography solutions (forking), not by VCs stepping into save the day. If you think both are the same, you clearly understand NOTHING about crypto whatsoever. The DAO hack and the hard fork took over a month to assess, propose solutions and resolve. It wasnt an overnight fix, like what solana is known for. 


When Solana goes down - over night fix.

When bridge hacked? - overnight fix. 

How long will Solana depend on overnight fixes to bail the network out?

Edit: The mental gymnastics of SOlshills is just incredible. They have clearly consumed all the kool aid in the world to be supportive of this kind of institution manipulation. Yes, other projects also have VCs, and Eth projects have also been hacked. Yet none of the ETH projects have been bailed out in this manner by VCs and institutions. I have been extremely critical of ETH too. There is virtually a hack a day on Eth due to poor code or implementation or bugs, but none of the ETH project hacks have been ""replenished"" by institutions. If an ETH projects gets hacked and people lose money, well you are shit out of luck. As evidenced by hundreds of hacks and scams before. 

The first major Solana hack, and less than 24 hours later the institutions propping up solana claim they are bailing everyone out. If this is not the least bit suspicious to you, then you are just being slow boiled alive. 

Solana itself is a long term pump and dump that is devoid of any decentralisation and fundamentals except a bunch of whales propping it up. The tokenomics of every single Solana ""ecosystem"" project is puke worthy - from Serum to Raydium, Bonfida, Saber etc all have massive supply in the hands of a few, an incredibly high FDV and a low float and funny unlock mechanisms - perfect conditions for institutions to keep dumping on hapless retail investors like the ones supporting Solana in the comments here who dont understand anything about crypto or finance.",4509,2022-02-04 03:17:30,1352

As the meme goes, the D in Solana stands for decentralisation.

A network that goes down this often will never be able to attract serious traders.

Imagine you are trading on margin and get liquidated because the network was down.. this happens in centralised exchanges. Solana now natively brings this kind of user experience to the blockchain where you can experience network failure on the chain. What a wonderful innovation.

Blaming it on attackers is just dishonesty. A well designed blockchain is not supposed to have attackers, its supposed to keep producing blocks based on the parameters of the network, not take a break because someone spammed transactions.

Users are repeatedly questioning the validity of the status dot solana page that shows 100% uptime even when the network was down, and even Coinbase flagged it as down.

This is why you dont use a service's own status page to come to conclusions especially if it masquerades as a decentralised blockchain, but in reality is just a glorified database.

Edit 3: This post is brigaded from the Solana sub. Hundreds of Sol shills are trying to pretend the network wasnt down. Ironically, on Sol sub itself, someone agrees that not only did the network go down, but had to be rebooted too.

Solana founder promoting this as a ""paradigm shift"" is scummy","Move to earn apps are gaining popularity and many seem to even think all of this is sustainable. A huge number of such apps have just launched out of nowhere. 

Stepn for their part helps further the scam by closely controlling how many invites can be sent out each day, thereby ensuring supply/demand and the ponzi scheme doesnt collapse overnight. However they can only do this for so long. New people buying shoes are paying for early entrants to exit. Some time ago, the cheapest shoe to enter was around $700. At the end of this scheme, many will lose their investments they have put into the scheme. 

It is just similar to bitconnect where new depositors withdrawals were limited (you could only withdraw after some time in the system). If you control the entry and exit parametric of a devious ponzi scheme, you can further the time till it all collapses.

Based on these recommendation from ""public figures"", people are putting money into this expecting profits. If everyone understands it's a ponzi and still decides to play the game, knowing the first one out win and the last one baghold to zero - thats fine given how devious this industry is. But to promote it as a ""paradigm shift"".... bruh

Some seem to think its not a scam because ""the app makes me go an extra mile a day and I also made $100, I cant possibly be scam"". - this is the same kind of thought process that led to $40 BN being wiped off the market just 2 weeks ago.",3071,2022-05-24 07:52:59,1242

Solana contracts return DROPPED errors on *50% to 80%* of all current transactions. You experience them as order delays and frustration. See for yourself at [solanabeach.io](https://solanabeach.io)

The Cause: **Low TVL + fragmented liquidity = Big slippage problems**

On Monday 3/18, SOL Dex Volume totaled $2.8B vs Ethereum's $2.0 Billion. This should be good news. But Solana's low liquidity cannot support the volume.

Poor liquidity creates added volatility and slippage fails. Solana strives to outperform Ethereum, but with only access to the equivalent of 8% of Ethereum's liquidity by contrast.

>***Solana's annual inflation rate is currently 5.515% and will decrease by 15% every year.***

But how do you define a year?

Its necessary to understand Sol Foundation's answer to that stupid question. The annual numbers are based on the length of an epoch-year. An epoch-year isn't 365 days. An epoch-year is 180 epochs.

Rough formula to calculate an epoch-year.

* 1 epoch = 2.5+ days
* 180 epochs = 1 Epoch Year
* 1 Epoch Year spans 450 to 630 Earth days (dependent on the length of each epoch).

Epoch years offer flexible margins to adjust your numbers. So the 5.515% inflation rate is technically accurate. The tech-docs end with the 5 yellow-highlighted words: ***Actual inflation rate will vary.***

Its equally important to consider that inflation is the effective circulating supply. Everything that's out there! But the Solana Foundation only factors new SOL issuance used to pay validators. That's misleading, if not deceptive.

I have literally sold all my SOL, I've bought a bag of MATIC and I'm never going back. It's more decentralized (SOL has proven to be extremely centralized), The team can actually be trusted and it's just an overall better chain IN MY OPINION. 

Yes I know Solana has a higher market cap but I feel like in the long term, Polygon will be flipping it. Are you really so obsessed with making a quick buck that you'd invest in a project who's developers have blatantly lied to your face and have disrespected you on multiple occasions?

SOL,cryptocurrency,"Solana is centralized, stoppable and its fundamental design flaws are considered features by SOL guys. Genuine decentralisation and well-designed security make a far more valuable proposition than some big TPS numbers. If you can't run a full-node yourself then it's just another bank.","I'll start with September '21 and the quote from Gavin Wood:

Events of today in crypto just go to show that genuine decentralisation and well-designed security make a far more valuable proposition than some big tps numbers coming from an exclusive and closed set of servers. If you can't run a full-node yourself then it's just another bank.

Fast forward to December '21 and quote from Justin Bons:

Solana was DDoS attacked again. This attack exploited fundamental design flaws which are considered features by SOL.  As it sacrifices decentralization & security for speed while ignoring the consequences of that trade off  specifically Proof of History & Turbine (PoH).

A consequence of PoH is deterministic block creation:  There is a good reason why public blockchains before SoL did not take this route.  Non-deterministic block creation adds to security & censorship resistance as you cannot predict who will create the next block.

Instead in SoL it is possible to predict & therefore attack the next block producers.  For instance attacking the next 100 validators instead of attacking the entire network.  This attack also works regardless of scale, thereby severely reducing SOL security.

SOL security is not just reduced against DDoS attacks since this attack can also be combined with a 51% attack  allowing an attacker to temporarily gain proportional staked control over the network by attacking other large stake holders. These are all consequences of PoH!

Combining Turbine with PoH leads to even more dire consequences:  Turbine divides the transaction memory pool into small groupings of validators.  This means that with PoH you can censor transactions by just attacking the specific validators in that grouping!

This is just one aspect of SOL's design that exposes the bad faith of its creation.  Prioritizing attracting ignorant cryptocurrency investors over good sustainable blockchain design.  There are many examples like this in terms of design as well as lies & fraud, buyer beware

TL;DR: Solana is a shit network, SOL is a shitcoin and when VC dumps their SOL it's gonna be spectacular like diarrhea.

SOL,cryptocurrency,"Solana is currently congested with an Average Ping Time of 20-40s, 30-50% Ping loss, up to 50-80% failed transactions. Still unable to exceed 1200 True TPS.","[https://solscan.io/](https://solscan.io/) shows the Average Ping Time and drops at the bottom of their main page. There is currently about 30-50% loss and an average ping time of 20-40s. This means if you submit a transaction, it'll take that long before it gets included, and it has a high chance of not being included.

The whole network has been congested for days, and a lot of people are complaining about this in the Solana community.

[High average ping time and loss](https://preview.redd.it/y31j59t27soc1.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c1ead6919ba0df91eaf8a4f1730b7a58972150e)

In addition, there are tons of failed non-vote transactions. I'm estimating around 50-80% of Tx are failing. This is due to all the spam and MEV that's been going on due to excessive meme coin activity on Solana. (If you don't believe me, just pick a random block on [https://solscan.io/blocks](https://solscan.io/blocks) and scroll down past the vote transactions.)

Most of you probably already know that Solana is not a 50k TPS network due to vote transactions. It's just marketing BS and misreporting.

For the longest time, I've suspected that Solana maxes out at 1100-1200 TPS in real life conditions. This is proof that even when the network is full with 30-50s wait times, it does not exceed 1200 True TPS. I've checked this chart dozens of times in the past 2 years during Solana congestion, and highest I've ever seen was 1200 True TPS.

[Today's True TPS is about 900-1100 TPS](https://preview.redd.it/61n4zzaf8soc1.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=a58878c55176e7229e436c8f847312f0e4af355a)

On average, non-vote transactions account for 10-20% of the total transactions. And the daily average of True TPS is about 300-400 TPS. Even during the spike in Dec 2023, it did not exceed 800 TPS.

SOL,cryptocurrency,Solana Labs CEO: It ‘doesn’t really matter’ if the network goes down again / let that sink in what kind of garbage Solana is,"Quick Take

* In September, the Solana blockchain was swamped by transactions and ended up going offline for 17 hours.
* Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko says that this is only a problem for those measuring in milliseconds.

When asked what are the chances the network goes down again, Yakovenko  replied, “I don’t know. It doesn’t really matter, though.”

His argument went as follows: as long as there’s at least one copy of  the ledger, the funds are still safe and the transactions will  eventually get processed. If you don’t care how long a transaction takes  to go through, “then how much do you care that there's a 72 hour  block?” 

Yakovenko likened the downtime to a particularly long wait between  blocks. He claimed that Solana didn’t really go offline, there just  wasn’t a confirmed block for that time period. “So that technically does  look like a 17-hour block if you look at the history.”

Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano have entered the chat for a laugh... C'mon bois, this is the biggest centralized shitshow of the century and it seems that going offline might happen again or frequently!

SOL,cryptocurrency,Solana Sucks: Factually-Based Reasons,"By the numbers, Solana is one of crypto's worst projects.

SOL supply inflated 68% in three years.

# SOL SUPPLY

Jan 2021:  261.9 Million

Feb 2024:  441.8 Million

180 Million New Sol spanning a 37-month timeframe.

Solana's posted inflation schedule is adrift from reality. The asterisk symbol is its only truthful piece of information. So let's follow it and see where it leads.

[These figures are misleading](https://preview.redd.it/b0c8kozaqrjc1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ef25f0224d7e0ac35e1fc3169cbb11fabc992d9)

# EPOCH YEAR

From Solana Official Docs:  Solana's annual inflation is currently 5.515%. Note that this is an 'epoch-year', or \~ 180 epochs.

Okay now WTF is an epoch-year? An easier explanation than this.

**MEANWHILE ON PLANET SOL**

On Planet Sol, a year spans 180 epochs.  1 epoch = 2.5+ days.  Epoch years range 450 to 630 Earth days.  See for yourself.

[Actual inflation rate will vary](https://preview.redd.it/2t6vibotqrjc1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b0e74de593a8154ad09a9f8500484a683d4a702)

But hold on.  ""Non-stakers pay stakers?"" What's that about? Merits a closer look.

# NON-STAKERS PAY STAKERS

New SOL issue pays Validators. Solana rewards remaining new issue to Stakers.

Problem: New SOL inflates currency and fee burn's insufficient.

Solution: Reward shields Stakers from inflation. Non-Stakers get no reward.  Non-Stakers pay for inflation. They become the yield for Solana stakers.

Non-Stakers Pay Stakers.

Solana's definitely a performer. Smart investors can earn so long as they're mindful of its tokenomics issues.

Over the last 12-months, 1000% ROI.🔥

# SOL to $1000;CAP to $441 Billion

* $45 Billion market cap must climb to $441 Billion to reach $1000 p/c
* To achieve that, it must capture greater share of DeFi & NFT market
* To have a chance at those markets, Solana can't tip over. Like never again.
* Solana must raise its fees

Solana's current fee structure guarantees it can never compete with Ethereum.

# CLOSED-SOURCE CENTRALIZATION

Etherscan is an open book for crypto projects. Right down to the source-code.

Go on Solscan and good look finding any open-source code.

High node count and active devs are canceled out by Solana's closed-source smart contracts for:

* NFTs

 I was very enthusiastic about solana and I was on the verge of buying a bag of SOL several times. 

The first time the system went down, I still thought to myself that this was going to be a one-time error. I did lose a lot of faith in the blockchain, but I found the concept of ""proof of history"" very interesting, so I was still interested in the coin. 
This was followed by the large price increase and the necessary hype, which caused the price to rise even more. SOL was quickly in the top 5 cryptos and took over ADA's spot easily. 

Suddenly, in September the system goes down again for several hours. I thought this would be the end of SOL. This was when I was extremely surprised that SOL's price remained stable and even continued to climb quietly. I didn't understand. 

But when the ddos ​​happened and the system was down again recently, I really really thought that SOL was going to plummet (especially in these difficult times full of uncertainty). This STILL didn't happen.

Solana is hyped so much, but really the reason why it can do so many TPS and what not is because it takes a fucking supercomputer to run a node, and the project is centralized.    Please read this blog about what it takes to run a solona node:  [https://blog.lopp.net/2021-altcoin-node-sync-tests/](https://blog.lopp.net/2021-altcoin-node-sync-tests/) Some takeaways from the post:

>it takes a computer with AT LEAST 128gb of RAM to run a node (they recommend 256gb of RAM,  not disk space,  RAM)  
>  
>you have to get data from trusted validators, and All four --trusted-validators are operated by Solana (like you can't do what you need to do to verify, you have to trust)  
>  
>Solana is most likely running those trusted validators on google cloud

Do your own research on this new coin.  **For me, if the average person can't run a node,  its not decentralized.**

EDIT:  I shopped around and if you want to get a computer to run a solana node, you will need to invest 5k to 10k USD.  Here are the specs: Hardware Recommendations#

    CPU
        12 cores / 24 threads, or more
        2.8GHz, or faster
        AVX2 instruction support (to use official release binaries, self-compile otherwise)
        Support for AVX512f and/or SHA-NI instructions is helpful
        The AMD Threadripper Zen3 series is popular with the validator community
    RAM
        128GB, or more
        Motherboard with 256GB capacity suggested
    Disk
        PCIe Gen3 x4 NVME SSD, or better
        Accounts: 500GB, or larger. High TBW (Total Bytes Written)
        Ledger: 1TB or larger. High TBW suggested
        OS: (Optional) 500GB, or larger. SATA OK
        The OS may be installed on the ledger disk, though testing has shown better performance with the ledger on its own disk
        Accounts and ledger can be stored on the same disk, however due to high IOPS, this is not recommended
        The Samsung 970 and 980 Pro series SSDs are popular with the validator community
    GPUs
        Not strictly necessary at this time
        Motherboard and power supply speced to add one or more high-end GPUs in the future suggested

Since then, Solana shot up in value, skyrocketing from $63.86 to over $250 (and becoming the number 4 crypto) just under 3 months later on Nov. 05, 2021. However the 2022 bear market has been particularly hard on SOL as it's currently down \~88% since the ATH. Outage after Outage over the last year has caused this novel Proof of History blockchain to bleed out its market cap.  

Now just 448 days after becoming a top 10 crypto SOL has officially been flipped by MATIC and fallen out of the top 10. How long the flip lasts is another question, but for now SOL is out of the top 10.

Did the devs ever even figure out what happened with the last major outage only 10 months ago?

>**Solana Developers Say Reason for Network Outage Still Unclear**  
“At approximately 05:46:16 UTC 2023-02-25, Solana Mainnet Beta suffered a significant performance degradation,” the developers said. “Eventually leading the validator community to opt for a restart of the network. The cause of this is still unknown and under active investigation.”  
“Root cause is still unknown and under active investigation,” developers added.  
The problems that started as sluggish transaction processing spiraled into a near complete shutdown of activity on Solana, validators and developers told CoinDesk over the weekend.

And what about that Mainnet **Beta?** Yes, you heard right, it's still only in Beta, even though they said over 2 years ago that it's ready for prime time, but they'd keep the '**Beta**' tag for a year or so:

>Mainnet is launched! It was launched in March and is successfully working. For your understanding - Yes, we were first calling it beta because it was just launched and not every function was available.  
***We will keep the suffix ""beta"" for a year or so because we want to check the mainnet stability in the long term and make sure we have a great product.*** But it's a working network - partners work on this network, Serum DEX running on this blockchain, KIN moves it's users to this network and that is exactly the blockchain the Solana Accelerator team winners use to build on.

SOL,cryptocurrency,"Algorand now has > 10x the smart contract throughput than Solana and any other top L1 (SOL, BSC, AVAX, MATIC, CELO, ETH included)","I think we can all agree that tps numbers can be hard to compare between chains. Some chains can pin 10000s of native token transfers, but things get weird when you start to compare smart contracts.

Last year, I posted about [this metric](https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/the-amm-test-a-no-bs-look-at-l1-performance-4c8c2129d581) in the Algorand subreddits for determining throughput of different blockchains in the ***fairest*** way possible. That is using an AMM “uniswap-style” swap as the benchmark.

The authors of the medium article linked in my original post tested the smart contract throughput of some of the top smart contract platforms *empirically*, and they found that these chains to have the following AMM-swap tps limits:

* Solana Mainnet Orca - 273 swaps
* BSC pancakeswap - 195 swaps
* Polygon quickswap - 95 swaps
* Avax Trader Joe - 176 swaps
* Celo Ubeswap - 50 swaps
* Ethereum uniswap v2 - 18 swaps

Immediately after the 6k tps upgrade, I made a post about Algorand's ability to perform these AMM-style swaps which was *estimated* using the assumption that an AMM swap would require four txns per swap. This estimation came out to about 1625 swaps per second. At the time this was very impressive because the next fastest chain was Solana capped at being able to do 273 swaps per second.

People foreshadowed in the comments on one of my previous posts saying that it could definitely be done in less than four transactions, but I wanted to be conservative at the time.

Today, I saw on twitter that one of the developers from Vestige actually [**empirically tested** this on the MAINNET](https://twitter.com/vestigefi/status/1612411850158637056) and proved that **Algorand can do 2881 AMM-style swaps per second.** You can see the on-chain evidence in [this block](https://algoexplorer.io/block/26101804). 

[Algorand literally dwarfs these other chains in smart contract efficiency](https://preview.redd.it/ds1vjukn75ba1.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4344c5944148c3545297725b6e543ea821cdb52)

* 10.5x more than Solana Mainnet Orca - 273 swaps
* 15x more than BSC pancakeswap - 195 swaps
* 30x more than Polygon quickswap - 95 swaps
* 16x more than Avax Trader Joe - 176 swaps
* 57x more than Celo Ubeswap - 50 swaps
* 160x more than Ethereum uniswap v2 - 18 swaps
* **3.5x more than all of them combined - 807 swaps**

If anybody can do this experiment for other popular Layer 1s like Tezos, NEAR, or Elrond or the Layer 2s on ETH, I would love to include them here.

After the developers had to shutdown the network to fix the bug, the FUD around Solana was enormous! There were dozens of posts in this subreddit claiming that SOL is about to die and that its run was over!

However now after a few red days, SOL is almost 15% up since yesterday. There are many upcoming conferences. Whales are jumping in. Companies are building on Solana because it is fast and cheap. According to most predictions SOL is about to reach $250 soon (not a financial advice though).

In my opinion all that shows that people put profits over decentralization (suprise! /s). Most people would probably even betray their values just to make some quick money!",911,2021-09-18 17:07:39,564

2. **48.71%** of all transactions through Raydium are failing. 

3. Transactions will fail for a **variety of reasons** not just slippage issues. 

4. Voting consensus transactions & failed transactions massively bloat the blockchain size, **currently \~265 TB & growing fast.** 

5. Again, **TPS includes voting consensus and failed transactions**, failed transactions on most other blockchains are strictly validated before even hitting the blockchain. 

6. **Firedancer** is live on mainnet, but in 'non-voting mode' which means it cannot produce blocks and is **only doing about \~30% of what a validator does.** 

7. **RPC endpoint architecture allows operators to reorder transactions and front-run.** 

8. ***$7.5 billion SOL, is continued to be sold-off by FTX, a major unlock occurs in March 2025, and continued unlocks every month up till 2028.*** (Repeated due to importance). 

9. **5 million daily active users is a myth, 4.5 million of these hold 0 SOL, and much more hold < 1, they are created with an intention to inflate metrics,** notice the large uptick in August, also 1 user(bot) could technically have 4 million wallets. 

10. **The Top 18 validators control +33% of the entire staked Solana supply, meaning they can collaboratively block consensus and censor transactions.**

TL;DR: I added a comedy flair for ""comedy"" purposes because if someone told you that this is one of the major crypto networks you'd indeed think that crypto is a scam...

SOL,cryptocurrency,The Total Value of assets Locked (TVL) in Solana has decreased from $10B all the way down to $250M now. Truly a fall from grace.,"I do not intend to sprinkle more fear into Solana right now, especially as I am also a holder of it, but the rise and fall of Solana is truly one for the history books. Back in 2021 SOL was seen as the next big thing and was even realistically seen as an “ETH killer“. SOL even had a parabolic rise right in the middle of BTC collapsing due to China FUD in May 2021.

But once the bear market came, just like everyone else Solane also had to collapse and that from a price of $250 to now just $18, truly a massive price crash, but this is not the only thing that went down:

TVL, Total Value Locked, shows the total value of all the assets that are on a network. It is often used as a metric to gauge the legitimacy of a Crypto. Here we can see an even worse collapse, from over $10B to now just $250M and we obviously can not forget the upcoming FTX liquidations that will likely happen over the years.

So yeah, I don't want to provoke people to sell all their SOL, but as much as we joke about it, in Crypto anything is possible we have already seen the craziest comebacks with BTC itself. So stay resilient and make sure to keep an eye out for latest news.",328,2023-09-16 16:43:18,376

If you didn't know, SBF was a very vocal proponent of Solana. He actually went as far as to call Solana literally 'the most underrated token'. Alameda Reearch, a trading firm owned by SBF held around ***10% of the circulating supply*** of SOL in its accounts. A quick rehash of Solana's issues are the very heavy investment and control that VC firms have over Solana as well as their many network outages and heavy centralization.

Alameda Research is now bankrupt and these tokens that they held may be sold off to pay back creditors. Additionally, these are many questions regarding the viability and value of the SOL token as another token that made up a large portion of Alameda's balance sheet, FTT, is mired in scandal as it is very likely to have been used as a tool in very ponzi-like business operations, with Alameda and FTX effectively printing money out of thin air. All of this yields heavy downward pressure on the price of SOL.

 Additionally on 10th Nov Solana was meant to release/unstake a full 63 million SOL to the market as their lock-up/stake period had ended. This amounted to around 10% of supply. This unlock of 28.5 million SOL *by the Solana Foundation* was postponed due the the FTX/Alameda collapse and would released two days later. Thus the market was looking at a *potential* iselling of 20% of supply plus whatever SOL holders simply lost faith and decided to sell. All these things did not bode well for it's price.",590,2022-11-14 12:22:45,366

As the ETFs go live this opens the door for the tokenization of assets(stocks, bonds, real estate, etc) to begin on Ethereum. Ethereum gets all the real life good securities on the network and Solana gets all the useless celebrity scams.

The proposal is here:
https://forum.solana.com/t/proposal-for-enabling-the-reward-full-priority-fee-to-validator-on-solana-mainnet-beta/1456

The voting has started and you can find the validators voting in support of this here:
https://solscan.io/account/YESsimd96Cuw3M5TYAkZ1d71ug4bvVHiqHhhJzsFHHQ#splTransfers

At today's current prices the users of Solana can expect nearly $1,000,000 USD a day of increased emissions/inflation. If congestion occurs, traffic picks up, or Solana price increase these values will exponentially grow.

The key takeway besides the changing of monetary policy the validators are voting for themselves, there is an exposed risk with having 0% burn fee where the validators will collude to stuff blocks with worthless transactions or copy pasta dozen of ore scripts to manipulate priority fees for profit with no risk.

Just thought people should be aware of this high level centralization and what a lot to consider theft and a bait and switch to steal from investors after traffic and priority fees increased to nearly 90% of all fees on Solana. The level of greed from these validators should be shunned by every solana holder. I hope everyone enjoys the new inflation and devalue of their holdings once this closes.

SOL,cryptocurrency,"PSA: Solana does not actually do 4k TPS, it inflates its numbers","While most crypto would say transactions per second are just that, tranactions per second, Solana includes communications between validators as ""transactions"".

400 TPS is nothing to scoff at, but a long way from the huge TPS claims.

Validators need to communicate to get to consensus. This is true in every chain. Sent a TX? Everyone needs to know. Minted an NFT? Everyone needs to know. However, most chains don't claim this as TPS.

And before you say Solana is public about this, their official explorer on their own website literally just shows the broad TPS.

SOL,cryptocurrency,What's up with Solana meme coins? ,"It seems like completely random meme coins on Solana have been popping up out of nowhere and going 10-1000x in a really short period of time.

I did a bit of digging and found out on Dexscreener that there are quite a lot of really small coins on Solana and they are created every day. Most of them obviously have no real value and they look like pump and dump schemes. It's really the closest thing to a casino I've seen in the cryptocurrency space. 

It's understandable that most of these coins end up nowhere, but how do some of them explode to such a high degree? Like one of the largest coins Dogwifhat WIF which went from 0.0001 to 2.5 dollars. And Book of Meme (BOEM) is the latest trending one, it skyrocketed straight after its release. These coins have such random names, they don't even associate with anything trending (at least on a large scale) so it's hard to pinpoint what exactly is driving the price action for these coins. Could it be some kind of an inside job? Has anyone done a deeper research about this topic?

SOL,cryptocurrency,L2 scaling solutions Arbitrum and Optimism have both flipped Solana in TVL. One without even a native token. L2s are here and scaling DeFi,"Arbitrum and Optimism have both already flipped Solana in terms of TVL.

[TVL of top 10 chains. Source: DefiLlama](https://preview.redd.it/5nv1fx5bdhx91.jpg?width=2764&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=810b3ae59201d0d5e36332877f316477af17efc0)

As of now, Solana's TVL has dropped below $1bn and has lost 22% of its TVL in the last month, in a major blow to the project.

And Arbitrum doesnt even have a native token (yet!). But it has already leapfrogged Solana both in terms of TVL and also in number of projects deployed on the network. Having a native token means a portion of the token's supply is deployed in various DeFi protocols, thereby increasing the chain's TVL. This is the case with Solana, where Solana's native token SOL is deployed into various Liquid staking protocols, CDPs, DEX LPs and lending pools, thereby increasing the TVL on Solana network. Arbitrum doesn't even have a token, yet has amassed over $1bn in real TVL.

Another interesting fact is that now 9 of the top 10 chains are all EVM compatible chains. Solana is the only one that is a non-EVM chain.

Edit: 

Currently Arbitrum is  quite centralized. L2s use sequencers and validators to generate fraud proofs, and currently the Arbitrum team operates these and therefore the L2 is quite centralized.

[https://l2beat.com/scaling/risk/](https://l2beat.com/scaling/risk/) \- you can click over the yellow box to see the security assumption risks under which L2s are currently operating. Right now, all the L2s are centralized to various degrees. 

The technology to decentralize sequencers is still being developed. It is around 12-24 months away. No one really thought that L2s would be big in 2022 itself, and Zk-rollups are also almost nearing mainnet launch. The initial belief was zk-rollups wouldn't be live till 2025. Tech in this space moves very fast 

Launching a token helps decentalize the network. The base layer gas token cannot be used to decentralize a L2 rollup that is built on top of the base layer, or govern the L2 network.

These are the common mantras often spruiked by members here. 

What many fail to realise is the significant progress that has been made by the developers on the Solana blockchain in recent months. 

**So why does Solana seem to get congested?**

In the past, when Solana experiences a larger than normal number of transaction requests, it slows down. Ethereum alleviates this issue, by raising the price of its gas fees. However, Solana does not, the fees remain the same, so the network becomes congested. 

In some cases, the network becomes so congested, that transactions get interrupted or stalled, and the network goes offline. Stalls. It then needs to be restarted from the previous block by the validators.

**What has changed?**

Among the many improvements, the Google-supported QUIC protocol was implemented and stress testing has been underway for some time now. Validators have also been working hard to upgrade to the latest software to bring them all in line. 

This was especially more difficult as another change made was also the number of validators is almost at 2000. Coincidentally, this has led to a vastly improved Nakamoto Coefficient of 32. Higher than most of its competitors.    

[Stress tests using the QUIC protocol](https://preview.redd.it/mh38egrds6m91.jpg?width=2292&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f2f2c7520121cce9e347dac591efad8f4aa634)

These tests have shown that the network is able to handle over 14000 transactions per second. For reference, most other major blockchains process less than 1000 transactions per second.

The average TPS rate on Solana [usually hovers](https://solana.com/) around \~3000  

&#x200B;

**So why was today special?**

NFT Mints. 

I'm not fond of NFTs, but I can't deny their success on the Solana chain. A much hyped token mint called Y00ts, was launched today. This brought a massive influx of speculators and NFT collectors to the Solana chain simultaneously in the hope of snagging one. 

&#x200B;

[TPS during the NFT mint - steady and stable](https://preview.redd.it/t0ci3sluu6m91.jpg?width=2246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94f72d1e21fbc5aa9015a99f6f4dab4f62d0b80b)

&#x200B;

Despite the obvious stresses, and past experiences, the chain did not stop, halt, slow down at all. The fact that nothing happened whatsoever, is undeniable evidence that the changes being made by the Solana developers are working. 

People here love to bag it out for its dodgy performance, but there's a reason I remain very bullish on Solana, despite all the downvotes I cop for it.",462,2022-09-06 07:13:56,413
