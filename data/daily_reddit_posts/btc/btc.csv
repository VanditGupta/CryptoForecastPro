BTC,cryptocurrency,I hope people can see whats happening with US based cryptos and Bitcoin,"Crypto investor since 2017, made good money, enough to quit my job in my mid 30s and travel and start a business and do other things I want with my life. Doesnt mean I know anything.  It is my belief that at some point, just like every other market, there will be a bust/selection period where 99% of projects become worthless. Of the remaining survivors, maybe 5-6 take up 80-85% of the market share, 5-6 take up 5-10% and the remaining hundreds or thousands of coins make up the last 5-10%  Example: Theres Verizon, Att, T mobile at the top, then theres tracfone and boost and mint mobile, then theres 100 that nobody knows anything about. There are 100s of brands of batteries but very few companies who actually make the batteries. Tons of tv companies, 5-6 that people know, dozens that we dont, 100s of other ones, and only a handful of huge manufacturers that make everyones tvs at the same place.  This is what will happen IMO because it always does, since forever.  And while I dont really care if youre a fan of the US or not, the US is the strongest economy in the world, and it is in the best position to harness this and benefit from it and control the direction of the space in the US and global narrative. Im not saying this is the best for crypto or the world, but I think it's ignorant to outright say it wont matter.  With the US and other countries getting on board with a strategic reserve, its clear bitcoin is and will continue to be a winner for the foreseeable future.  I believe this is also why we have the Dino/US coins pumping as their leaders have recently all been meeting together with some of them like Hoskinson even getting involved directly with legislators, meeting with senators, getting in front of congress and talking about what is best for us. Founders have all recently met, are all ISO 20022 compliant, and are all going nuts. I think this is a winning recipe for this cycle and for the future and I just want people to be aware of it. These projects **XLM XRP ADA HBAR ALGO** are outperforming a lot of other coins and I believe this is why, despite people starting to call them all irrelevant before this happened.  I am saying this because this is my third cycle in the space and have wasted time and money looking for pumpy coins when if I had just kept my money where I had it 7 years ago in these Dino coins (in XRP and ADA anyways), id have been proven right in my early conviction of these projects. Look at the narrative, research it, and make an educated guess. Do not ignore these trends and its ok to take risks on meme coins with a little bit of your portfolio but make sure you are on the right side of history when it all shakes out, because it will at some point in the not so distant future.",1163,2024-11-29 21:11:55,563

BTC,cryptocurrency,Ethereum just hit a brand new 3.5 year low against Bitcoin.,"ETH just hit a brand new 3 and a half year low against BTC after touching .03462 beating it's last 3 and a half year low of .03465 set just 8 days ago on Nov. 06th 2024. (.03462 means 1 eth is worth 3.46% of 1 BTC. )  In fact this means ETH has wiped all out gains against BTC since April 2021 when ETH was \~2k and BTC was around \~$60k. Since then ETH has completed the merge moving it from POW to POS and Proto-Danksharding (which dropped the gas cost on L2s). Still in comparing it's value against BTC, ETH has officially lost all of it's bear market gains.

Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at a great cost to the environment.

The top rated post now is a post saying that banks consumed 520% more energy than bitcoin, even though the top comments are saying it's a bad argument, there still a lot of people who think the article is right, if you go on Twitter bitcoin maxis are always saying people are dumb because they don't get it how bitcoin is more efficient. Banks processed 200 billions of transactions last year against what, 200 million bitcoin transactions? You don't have to be a genius at math to see that there's no way bitcoin would win if it had the same amount of users and transactions.   I'm not even getting into the argument that there are millions of people working for banks who likely would be working elsewhere and generating co2 emissions nevertheless. Those people work on different areas that you like it or not, are ""features"" bitcoin doesn't have, banks transaction output is not necessary related with their co2 emission because they do a lot more than sending money from A to B, you can't say the same about bitcoin, transactions = big energy output.    ""but defi is the future, we don't need banks"". You may be right, but if you look at sites like nexo/celsius, they are still companies with employees, they are competing with banks providing lendings, customer supoort, cards and insurance, not bitcoin. And they are doing fine.  ""the media attacks crypto even though most a lot of coins aren't using PoW or will move to something else in the near future"". Hmmm, so you are saying there are better solutions out there and still its better to not talk about bitcoin's energy waste? Sorry, but this is just delusional.   Crypto is at its core pushing technology forward and breaking paradigms, and with more adoption it also comes spotlight. If you look into the crypto space in 5 years and see that most coins and decentralized platforms are using something different than pure PoW, and bitcoin is still using PoW and consuming 10x energy from what it does now, you should think that's there's the possibility governments could act against mining, this year you saw hash rate drop with government-instituted blackouts in China, it wouldn't take much for countries to criminalize PoW mining if bitcoin is the only coin doing that and pretending nothing is happening while shouting ""I'm the king"".   TL;DR: bitcoin's PoW is a cow infinitely farting, there shouldn't be negationism in this space about it as everyone else is inserting corks inside their cows butholes.",11163,2021-05-05 05:06:58,2405

BTC,cryptocurrency,I'm honestly not buying this Billionaire - Bitcoin relationship anymore.,"I praised BTC in the past so many times because it introduced me to concepts I never thought about, but this recent news of billionaires joining the party got me thinking. Since when are the people teaming up with those that are the root cause of their problems?  Now I know that some names like Elon Musk can be pardoned for one reason or another but seeing Michael Saylor and Mark Cuban talk Bitcoin with the very embodiment of centralization - CZ Binance... I don't like where this is going.  Not to mention that we all expected BTC to become peer-to-peer cash, not a store of value for edgy hedge funds... It feels like we are going in the opposite direction when compared to the DeFi space and community-driven projects.   As far as I am concerned, the king is dead. The Billionaire Friends & Co are holding him hostage while telling us that everything is completely fine. This is not what I came here for and what I stand for. I still believe decentralization will prevail even if the likes of Binance keep faking transactions on their chains and claiming that the ""users"" have abandoned ETH.   May the Binance brigade have mercy on this post. My body is ready for your rain of downotes and manipulated data presented as facts.",11776,2021-02-24 11:02:26,2392

BTC,cryptocurrency,Been buying bitcoin every month for 76 months now,"Started in October 2017 with the goal of 'enough bitcoin to retire'. Got the general idea from the FIRE community (financial independence, retire early) but instead of buying the S&P every month, I chose to buy bitcoin every month. So, basically I save as much as possible from every salary --> buy as much bitcoin every month as possible. When I have a stack of 1 million euros in fiat terms, I consider myself as successfully retired and most likely gonna quit my job. I document my journey in this blog that I try to update once per month, hopefully you like it interesting and motivating! And whatever your capacity and timing for stacking sats is, I'm pretty sure this kind of 'bitcoin retirement plan' is way more efficient than the government one, so starting anything similar is highly recommended.

BTC,cryptocurrency,"The first website to buy bitcoin went online 13 years ago today- You could buy 1,309 BTC for $1.00 USD","The website New Liberty Standard was the first website to offer Bitcoin purchases. You were able to buy and sell Bitcoin through Paypal.

I was a freshman in college and a computer science major. It was Fall of 2010. I was in the lab when a Sophomore csci major asked me if I wanted to help him set up the \~35 computers in the lab for mining Bitcoin.  His plan was to mine every night after classes ended until 8am when classes began again and 24 hours over the weekend.  Me, thinking it was a waste of time with Bitcoin being like $.06, said no. The guy ended up setting up the computers himself, mining \~2,000 BTC, and in 2013 when the price hit $1,000, sold half his stack to become a millionaire in college.   Where were you the first time you heard of Bitcoin and what was the price per coin?",5403,2022-10-06 14:14:49,845
BTC,cryptocurrency,Bitcoin finally decouples from the stock market!,"Guys, this is the moment we have been waiting for - Bitcoin has finally decoupled from the stock market!  While the stock market has been pumping for five days straight, Bitcoin completely ignores it and continues to dump further down.  I've waited for this moment since 2017 and it has finally arrived! We did it, congratz to everyone who HODLed long enough to witness this historic moment. No more price movement following the stock market, from now on we just dump no matter what, what a blessing to be part of this community and the crypto space!

BTC,cryptocurrency,Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash are pumping...which means the latest batch of noob retail investors have finally arrived!,"I think many of you would consider Ethereum Classic a terrible investment, considering (1) it was the result of a hack, and (2) the hacker still has their bags of ETC available, which they periodically dump on unsuspecting investors. Bitcoin Cash doesn't have such a problematic origin, but might also be considered an unwise purchase given the lack of usage and development compared to BTC and other good projects.  So, when I open the charts and see that specifically BCH and ETC have been pumping hard for the last couple of days, my only conclusion is that new retail investment money has arrived and these noobs are dropping cash on 'cheaper' projects with the name Bitcoin and Ethereum in it. I should know, I did this exact thing myself earlier this year!  Here's hoping this signals the start of a another massive pump too.  Edit: spelling",6938,2021-11-10 12:41:18,1775

(Looking at Syria, Venezuela.. etc) All those thinking they sit on a moral high ground calling for the hunger of millions of people are disgusting double standard subhumans that have no empathy for their fellow human. I've seen people dying of hunger in the streets and guess what ? The governments are still strong and standing cause this isn't a fairy tail where the good side always wins.  Double standard cause the US have done far worse than this in literally every war they financed and/or were directly involved with, yet if anyone mentions this they're accused of being Putin apologists.  I can't fathom how cruel some people can get and calling for the hunger of a whole nation because of the actions of their fucked up dictator ! Do you (americans) think that you, your families and tour children deserve to suffer and famined because of your government's actions in the middle east, Latin America and around the world ? Do you ?  Fuck every single government. Power to the people.  You don't understand the basics of decentralisation, it's NOT hooray decentralisation unless some with a different belief system is using it. God I hate this sub lately  Edit : I mentioned the US doing far worse to point out that the American people DON'T deserve living in a famine for their government's actions, same like the Russian people or any other nation's people for that matter. Not because I'm pro-dictatorship like people are accusing me of.. but I think I won't defend myself anymore cause some people are so agenda oriented and so blind to the truth even if you hit them in the face with it, and will always see anyone who speaks out against the state media points as ""Puting apologist"" or ""pro-dictator"" or whatever new trendy name is used for public shaming anyone who thinks outside the flock",5175,2022-03-25 10:26:59,1942
