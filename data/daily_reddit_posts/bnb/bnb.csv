BNB,cryptocurrency,Binance report finds 97% of meme coins ‘have died’,,1478,2024-11-04 17:57:18,206
BNB,cryptocurrency,The trading algorithm I made can now detect a new coin within 0.3 seconds of it being listed on Binance,"It's been about two weeks now since I initially shared with you a tool that I had made in order to quickly buy into a new coin listing to take advantage of the initial surge in the price.

I've spent the past two weeks, debugging, fixing and optimising this code to get it to a level where it actually works. It's been a challenge to test since I have to wait for a new coin order and then check if it broke or not, but I think I finally got there.

Before I go explaining how the tool works, let me explain why I think that this particular strategy has some potential:

As some of you may have noticed, many coins seem to go through to what I would like to call a ""lightning-pump"" during their first few seconds of being listed on an exchange.

Have a look at ICP (you may put your pitchfork down, this chart is the perfect example):

&#x200B;

[chart for ICP](https://preview.redd.it/renmiomwk3k71.png?width=2650&format=png&auto=webp&s=74818add410e844f684bb0b0f0c43475de26a2f1)

In under a minute, the price of ICP shot up over 10 times, before slowly dipping into the void. Manually trading this 10x would be impossible, due to the speed required to catch this pump.

So I started building a bot that would detect new coin listings in about 20 seconds of them being listed on Binance.

It soon became quite clear that 20 seconds is way too slow to take advantage of the pump so I had to make it quicker.

The second improvement enabled the trading algorithm to find a new coin and place a buy order in about 5 seconds. This was better but not great.

Finally, I decided to remove all the breaks and just call the Binance API like crazy. Full steam ahead.

The bot is now able to detect a new coin listing in 0.3 seconds and place an order. There haven't been any new coins listed after I made this improvement so I will let it run and share my results once I have them.

I've also fixed any bugs that were caught by some of you that decided to test this out so thanks for that!

For anyone interested in trying it out, I've included a test mode that will simulate placing orders so there's no risk involved.

BNB,cryptocurrency,"I built a trading algorithm that detects the most volatile coins on Binance and aims to buy before a potential mooning, other devs are helping making this into a web app."," This trading bot will automatically place trades on the Binance exchange by detecting the most volatile coins in a given timeframe.

The project gathered significant attention from the GitHub dev community, and have helped to make significant improvements to the original codebase, and I thought you guys might like it as well.

The code was built with customisability in mind, where each user can modify parameters like:

* Define what % increase constitues a buy signal
* Time elapsed between price checks
* Trailing stop loss / take profit
* Stop buying when the market is bearish

In addition to the core functionality, the algorithm is now able to receive and act on external signals which are fully customisable.

It uses data from Tradingview, and this returns buy signals according to the most relevant indicators. BY default if at least 18 out of 26 indicators agree that it's a good time to buy a certain coin, this will tell the bot to go buy that coin.

The bot also has a newly-implement pause functionality. It essentially analyses 15 moving average indicators and if half of them show that's a bearish market, the bot will not buy during this period.

You can also choose and pick any number of custom indicators from oscillators to moving averages and more. Those require a bit of coding, and I'm hoping to make it more user-friendly in the future but the core functionality is there.

BNB,cryptocurrency,Cardano Overtakes Binance Coin as the 3rd Largest Cryptocurrency by Market Cap,"I'd say it's about time we saw Binance Coin drop down a notch!

Binance decided to disable trading of privacy coins in France on June 26th. This is a measurement to comply with the local regulatory requirements. The privacy coins that will be disabled from trading are DCR, DASH, ZEC, ZEN, PIVX, NAV, SCRT, XVG, FIRO, BEAM, XMR, MOB.

It's really a step backwards to regulate privacy cryptocurrencies. This means the local governments are trying to regulate things because of bad actors. Meanwhile bad actors are also using more cash FIAT than privacy cryptocurrencies.

BNB,cryptocurrency,I finally did it! My crypto trading bot successfully bought a new coin within 0.2 seconds of it being listed on Binance,"It's been a pain to optimise and test out this strategy but I finally managed to successfully place a buy order on a newly listed coin.

The testing has probably been the most difficult part of the whole process. Every time I would start the algorithm, I would have to wait there for days at a time before it does anything. Then Binance decides to list a new coin, and the script breaks. Go in and fix the error, re-start the script.

Rinse and repeat this a few times over two weeks, it was tedious and required a lot of patience but I fucking did it. I can now confidently call the script functional (with some minor bugs that I will fix in the coming days).

**So here's what actually happened:**

The algorithm detected GNO as a new listing yesterday at 6:00AM UTC, and placed a buy order at 6:00.02. The order was placed at 394 USDT and GNO peaked at 418 but the entry price was closer to 300.

It seems that even with 0.2s speed of execution the tool is still too slow to buy at the listed price and needs additional improvements.

It ended up selling at 3% loss - which might not seem like an achievement, but I am personally very happy with the fact that it actually works, and this gives me a good base to make the necessary improvements in order to optimise this strategy.

I do think that, if optimised correctly this tool can actually work very well. I will keep making improvements and report back. If you're curious to know more about how the bot works and how this buy order performed, I just made a new video explaining all of that in more detail: [**https://youtu.be/kWndcvWuMzI**](https://youtu.be/kWndcvWuMzI)

BNB,cryptocurrency,"The Coinbase and Binance Effect on Newly Listed Coins, namely MOONs","It is truly a momentous occasion when Kraken listed our very own Moons. I believe everyone in this sub has been running on hopium high since the listing. Now that Kraken (a huge respectable exchange) has listed MOONs, it would not be long before Coinbase and Binance follow suit. I did some research on this and found something called *the Coinbase and Binance Effect*. Hopefully from this, we can sort of estimate the price of MOONs when it is listed on Coinbase and Binance.

*Disclaimer: I am not an analyst and this is not financial advice.*

The Coinbase Effect

To start off, the Coinbase Effect refers to the price increase when a new coin is listed on Coinbase. The [data](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/07/coinbase-effect-means-average-91-token-price-gain-in-5-days-messari-says/) available in 2021 suggests that coins that are newly listed on Coinbase experience an average of **91% increase in value** over a 5 day period\*\*,\*\* which exceeds price actions when compared to other exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Gemini etc. They also mentioned that there is a wide distribution of price actions that range from -32% to 645%. However, we know that coins can go for much higher that breaks the median. One such example is the memecoin BALD, which recorded a **40,000% growth in 48 hours** when it was listed on Coinbase.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a6vx5rs7v8hb1.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=5adb1bed5ba4ab400bfc939416dc1008be939930

&#x200B;

 The Binance Effect

For more recent [data](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/06/binance-effect-means-41-price-spike-for-newly-listed-tokens/), the Binance Effect was quantified earlier this year in January. For comparison, the Binance Effect recorded a **41% increase** in price in the first 24 hours, followed by a **24% increase** on day 3. Over a 30-day period, tokens gain 73% on average. In the same article, they also quoted a market analyst at financial services firm at Conotoxia saying:

&#x200B;

>Grzegorz Drozdz, a market analyst at financial-services firm Conotoxia, estimated that in 2022 the price of around two-thirds of all newly launched tokens rose on Binance. The price of optimism (OP), for example, skyrocketed by more than 300% shortly after its debut on Binance.  
“It seems that we could expect a greater upward reaction after the Binance listing in 2023, confirming the transition from the 'Coinbase effect' to the 'Binance effect,'” he added.

&#x200B;

Moons listing on Coinbase and Binance

Obviously, nobody knows shit about anything in crypto. However, that doesn't stop us from applying the average increase in token prices to MOONs when they are listed on Coinbase and Binance.

MOONs price: **$0.506** as of writing this post.

In case of Coinbase listing, 91% increase for MOONs will give us **$0.966**  in a 5-day period.

In case of Binance listing, 65% increase for MOONs will give us **$0.835**  in a 3-day period.

Therefore, MOONs to $1 is very possible.

*This estimate takes the assumption that the price increase is smack dab on the average and does not take into account the cumulative/additive effect of multiple major exchange listings.*

&#x200B;

**TLDR; MOONs are most likely going to increase in price during Coinbase and Binance listing (duh?) and you can estimate the price increase using statistical data. In a bull market, these effects will likely be amplified and the moon is the limit. This is made for fun and not actually financial advice.**",161,2023-08-10 08:47:10,989
BNB,cryptocurrency,"Binance is balls-deep in Tether (over $17 Billion USDT) while under the gun of regulators. If a rush on capital occurs on the exchange, some serious dominoes are going to fall...and you will likely get boned. If you're smart, DO NOT store your coins (or cash) on Binance right now.","It's not new news that Binance is using Tether to support leveraged trading across the exchange...[https://www.binance.com/en/blog/391838076530913280/Binance-Futures-Trading-Platform-Increases-Max-Leverage-to-125x-with-BuiltIn-Risk-Controls-for-Traders](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/391838076530913280/Binance-Futures-Trading-Platform-Increases-Max-Leverage-to-125x-with-BuiltIn-Risk-Controls-for-Traders). (the overseas Binance, leverage trading is not allowed in binance.us)

And also not news that Tether is being ""backed"" only by some suspiciously unknown (most likely fractional) percentage of cash and  ""commercial paper"" from unknown entities. [https://www.coindesk.com/tether-first-reserve-composition-report-usdt](https://www.coindesk.com/tether-first-reserve-composition-report-usdt)

Binance is currently holding $17 BILLION Tether in its wallet. [https://wallet.tether.to/richlist](https://wallet.tether.to/richlist) .

The cycle seems something like this: Binance puts up some amount of collateral to Tether Treasury (likely some cash with the rest ""commercial paper""). Tether prints more Tether, loans it to Binance. Binance uses the new magic minted tether to give margin traders higher leverage to buy more Bitcoin....Bitcoin price goes up, more capital comes in, never ending cycle continues.  You should get the picture why this is bad without the word ""PONZI""

Multiple countries are once again cracking down on Binance. We've seen this happen before, but there's no certainty regulators won't come down harder this time. Any number of things could trigger a rush of withdrawals (eg. a margin-call on all leveraged accounts) from Binance

IF there is a sudden rush of withdrawals from Binance for whatever reason (and that rush coincides with a drop in Bitcoin prices), the exchange is going to have a dual monster on their hands. Say the US and EU regulators decide to team up to hit Binance/Binance.US with some mega regulations.

Coinciding with a decrease in BTC price, they're also going to be margin-calling a ton of those leverage accounts...inevitably resulting in heavily forced liquidations (to USDT). 

If that worst-case scenario happens, at some point they're also going to have to try to redeem all that tether they're holding for cash. But...as we've recently learned, Tether does not likely have any account with billions of dollars in liquid cash available, and Binance has an ""IOU"" with them anyway....so Tether says ""sorry Binance, you have this on loan, you're SOL"".

There is no telling how leveraged Binance is in unbacked Tethers.

So what does Binance do when they can't get liquidity to facilitate withdrawals?

It's not that unrealistic of a story given the current environment. If you need to use Binance, it should be a quick in and out.  Until things chill out with the regulatory environment, leaving any coins in there is asking to get burned.

**edit**

This post seems to have ruffled some feathers. To be clear I’m not saying this scenario will definitely play out. I’m saying this is a not impossible risk that exists with Binance, and there is no point absorbing the risk when alternatives to storing your coins exist. 

If you’re someone who thinks acknowledging and discussing risk is automatically “FUD”, and this sort of topic scares you, maybe investing in a high risk asset like crypto isn’t for you?",658,2021-07-18 00:22:07,586
BNB,cryptocurrency,I have yet another crypto trading algorithm for you guys. This one is able to analyse how volatile every coin on Binance is and place a trade when during a strong bullish movement,"Had a lot of fun with with one, and I'm happy to share the code with you guys.

So the algorithm is essentially listening to price changes in the last 5 minutes for all the coins on Binance. Once it detects that some coins have moved by more than 3% in the last 5 minutes, it takes this as a strong bullish signal and places a trade.

The algo is also able to store each bought coin in a local file and to track the performance of each trade placed so that it can perform stop loss and take profit actions and sell the coins that reach those thresholds.

Here's a more in-depth look at the bot parameters:

* By default we’re only picking USDT pairs
* We’re excluding Margin (like BTCDOWNUSDT) and Fiat pairs
* The bot checks if the any coin has gone up by more than 3% in the last 5 minutes
* The bot will buy 100 USDT of the most volatile coins on Binance
* The bot will sell at 6% profit or 3% stop loss

Billions of coins are still stuck while price is being desperately manipulated via FTX lev long futures.","I’m sure everyone saw the sudden 16 hour Solana network outage yesterday. During the outage the SOL price strangely tanked and then slowly recovered. That was because volume overall was pretty low since most of the coins are being either staked, stuck in various DeFi apps, or in wallets. The only coins that could be traded during the outage were already on exchanges. 

So everybody (including myself) was expecting a major price crash as soon as the SOL network went back online and people could get their coins out. 

But we saw was actually the opposite…it mysteriously pumped, and has since traded sideways.

So what happened? Pretty much as soon as it went online, millions were pumped into FTX lev long SOL future positions (check out the WhaleTrades)

At the same time, Binance, Coinbase, ( I believe FTX too), KuCoin and probably others I didn’t hear about suspended all deposits and withdrawals. So nobody with coins to move could even get them on exchanges to sell.

Meanwhile, People with staked coins can’t unstake/withdraw them until the Solana network epoch turns over. That doesn’t happen until several hours from now (according to solanabeach.io status tracker)

 But oh wait, unstaking was suspended on some apps too (reports coming from Exodus users)

As far as I know, Binance and Coinbase are still suspended.

There are tens of billions of dollars worth of coins still stuck in DeFi or unable to be moved on or off exchanges. The price is still being stabilized by incremental leveraged positions and wash/arb trading bots moving volume around 

There seems to be some blatant and desperate interference being run from the exchanges, who have been silent about this thus far. If there really was a mass SOL exodus, they’d have probably been bled dry of liquidity. 

Meanwhile investors are sitting on millions of dollars of losses they can’t mitigate, with their coins being held hostage.

The algorithm analyses all the coins on Binance and tries to pick out the ones with the highest probability of a strong bullish movement. This is done by taking into account the price difference. If the price of a coin has surged in the past few minutes, the bot will take this as a buying signal. This is based on riding the trend strategies.

The algorithm has a many configuration options such as:

&#x200B;

* The ability to select what to pair your coins to (by default USDT)
* Amount to spend on each trade
* Maximum number of coins that can be hold by the bot
* How much does a coin need to gain (in %) before the bot buys
* Stop Loss / Take Profit 
* Trailing Stop loss
* Simulated live trading and more features to come

BNB,cryptocurrency,"There's a crazy amount of will Binance collapse? Posts on here as of late, so I say to you all: Who cares, so long as you have your coins and tokens offline in a hardware wallet, does it really matter?","I'm not too sure why after all that has happened since the fall of Mt. Gox way back in 2014, and then too many other cryptocurrency related companies to list here going bankrupt, or running away with folks's hard earned fiat, coins, and tokens why we are still even having this collective fear, doubt, and uncertainty about Binance, or insert the few remaining centralized cryptocurrency exchange here.

Use the exchanges for what they are good at using them for, such as buying, selling, and trading, and then move your coins and tokens onto your preferred cold storage system. Why is this so hard to comprehend? How much more money do you have to lose, or watch others lose before you get the concept? Your money is not safe on any exchange. Your money is not safe on any exchange. Your money is not safe on any exchange.

Christmas is coming boys, gals, or whatever you identify as. Ask your mommy, daddy, or Santa Claus for a Ledger, a Trezor, or whatever hardware wallet you prefer, and have them place that sucker in your hand now as an early Christmas gift, so that you can secure your wealth properly, in your own custody as soon as possible.",75,2022-12-13 11:05:50,526
BNB,cryptocurrency,Coinbase have stolen my Eth deposit and ignored my correspondence with them. A quick search of their support sub reveals they do this a lot and apparently they're getting away with it.,"I deposited ETH, from an address I have used many times, to my CB address I have used many times without issues. Deposit made on Christmas day 2021.

I got the usual CB email saying they'd received my deposit, and the tx is confirmed on etherscan.

The coins were never put into my portfolio.

I opened a support ticket, and got a vague non-answer by reply (we're looking into it). It was promptly closed without explanation. I have since opened another 3 tickets which have all been met with similar vague responses, and then the tickets are closed without explanation. My requests to make a complaint have been ignored. I posted on their subreddit 2 weeks ago and got another vague response, no DMs etc.

I've posted there again today but don't expect much.

My account is not suspended etc., I am still able to transact with existing funds and deposit fiat. I tested this yesterday.

The funny thing is I trade high volume and had I continued using CBP, I would have paid them multiples of the value of this deposit in fees over the next 12 months. Congrats, you played yourselves.

I was able to live with CBP constantly going down during periods of volatility (sus AF!) but this is crossing the line.

**I am purely posting to encourage others to stay away from coinbase and CBP.** I am not the first person this has happened to. There are literally hundreds of posts like mine on their support sub where people have had funds vanish and the support team just ignores them.

Aside from this their fee structure sucks anyway. People seem think CBP is the cheapest for fees but they're only the cheapest if you trade over $100k per month. I only used them because it was a quick cash onramp from my Revolut account. I'll be sticking with Binance and Kraken from here on out. I will also be looking at the LRC DEX because they pay you to trade.

Be careful where you leave your funds.

EDIT: Lots of people doubting the legitimacy of my post which I guess is healthy skepticism. When I get home from work I will redact my personal details and edit in links to my (very one sided) correspondence with Coinbase.

Edit 2: I've done the above with mods.

**Edit 3: RESOLUTION!** Thank you all so much for your support. I'm happy to report that Coinbase were **magically** able to resolve my issue straight away after I tagged their reddit support account on this post. I received the mail in this image:

https://ibb.co/b61rYK8

I went straight to filing a complaint and within about 10 minutes my account was credited with the missing funds. They have devalued by about 30% ish since I sent them, and I sent them to be sold immediately at the time, but I seriously doubt I'll get anything else out of CB. I'm just glad to get my coins back at last.

Thank you all again. Naming and shaming most definitely works.

Also, a final word, a lot of people are looking for alternative exchange recommendations. I am in the EU and use binance a lot, also have a Kraken account and they have been recommended by a lot of people. But I know these aren't great options for some people in the USA.

I'm also going to look at using the LRC DEX for trading as they pay you to trade via negative fees! Amazing. I don't believe there's any geo blocks on this either. The issue I experienced makes me think DEXs are the way forward.

Good luck to everyone this year, don't forget to buy high and sell low 🚀",13524,2022-02-09 13:17:52,1456
BNB,cryptocurrency,"Doge paved way to a lot of scam coins: Beware of SH*T coins like Safemoon, Elongate, safemars, safegalaxy, safe whatever.","I see a lot of safemoon shills on every subreddit, youtube and Facebook. I just don't want to see more people falling for trash projects like these so please beware. The fake bots will already downvote this thread but I am hoping it will at least reach some actual users in here.

Here are a few coins that I looked into that are completely scams but are widely being promoted.

Safemoon, safemars, safegalaxy, elongate, Zepplin dao, ravenX, fox finance, moon pirate, moonrate, hungry bear. Basically any coin which says ""they will give you coins for any transaction on the chain and then will burn x% more"".

The idea of naming it ""Safe"" ""moon"" should be a good enough of a red flag.  Safemoon and these other coins has 1 wallet with more than 50% of the coins. You will see a hoard of fake users/profiles just trying to promote it. These coins have no utility, it is just a ponzi scheme with the entire idea being that people who come in last are gonna be bag holders and everyone below will make a portion of the bagholders investment if you bail out early before the rug pull. These people are trying hard to get you into safemoon etc. because they wanna hoard more money and they don't give a fuck about the people who are gonna be bag holders in the end.

Do not think that lot of people are buying the coins and you are gonna be missing out on 100x gains, majority of the people posting screen shots or talking about their experience are fake profiles.

How they try to entice you?

1. They are going to show their profits
2. They are going to promise exchange listing (Binance, Kucoin, their own exchange) which will never come I promise you.
3. They say they are transparent because they put couple of stooges for some dogshit AMA
4. They come up with some charity cause to make you feel not guilty about being part of a ponzi scheme or play on your good nature in general.
5. They make the coin value be well below 1 dollar like ($0.0000001) so its more enticing to you to get in on, giving you hope that its going to reach 1 dollar someday LOL.

It's mind blowing how some people play these mental gymnastics with themselves  to justify their ponzi scheme. ""I made 100x gains"", ""is it wrong for the little guy to make money"", ""i will put 50% of  profits into legit coins"".

I don't want these shit coins to be the face of crypto for all the new comers. Stop promoting/getting into these scam coins for a quick buck, it is just gonna give crypto space a bad name.

BNB,cryptocurrency,Not every new coin is a shitcoin: How to spot the real GEMS inside the sea of shitcoins.,"A few days ago, I made a post titled *""Rugpulls and Honeypots. What they are and how you can avoid them.""* Since then I got a lot of messages from people asking me how they can tell the difference between a new coin with lots of potential and a shitcoin. For maximum protection, make sure you follow this guide in combination with the other guide. I will not repeat those rules here. If you don't follow the rules of the other guide as well, you will lose your money.

Before I start, some background: I trade small coins for a living. In the beginning, while learning, I fell for all the scams just like everyone else. But with every loss I learned something new and I'm now pretty good at it. Yes, I have losses like everyone else, but usually I get out with very small losses compared to my gains.

Anyone here hating shitcoins, I agree with you. **I hate shitcoins too.** Part of what I want to explain here however is that not every new coin is a shitcoin. Every coin has to start with 0 holders. Everyone has to start somewhere. And every solid project deserves a chance to grow. Yes, the vast majority of new coins are shitcoins, but I want to help you tell the difference between the real gems and all the shitcoins.

# The Golden Rules

If you start looking for the real gems and want to trade smaller coins, **follow these rules or you will lose money**. 

1. Start trading on the BSC (Binance) Smart Chain. Why? Transactions cost around $0.20 max. You can't do this on the ETH chain where you spend lots on gas fees, sorry. I know they came down, but they're still too high.
2. For the first 1-2 months, don't invest more than $5 per coin. I am not joking. Yes, your gains will not be thousands of dollars, but if you go in with more you will end up losing a lot of money, trust me.
3. Have a small bag of maybe $150 or $200. Be prepared to lose your small bag completely. If you can't afford this and sleep well at night, don't do it.

**Ready? Let's start:**

# Find the Coins

Go to the BscScan website (look up the links yourself, I don't want to link-spam this post). Then, go to ""View BEP-20 Transfers"". If the list looks confusing, don't worry. Look at the rightmost column that says ""Tokens"". You must look for the grey icon besides the coin names. Why? Because that means the coin is new. Established coins already have their icons listed and that means you're usually too late to make high gains. You can refresh that page for new coins every second, you will always find new ones.

Open the new coins (with the grey icon) in separate tabs and look at them. So, now you have found a coin, it's time to investigate.

# 1. Holders

On the page you just opened, look at the ""Holders"" list. The biggest holders of a coin should always be the liquidity pool which is usually identified as ""PancakeSwap: COIN NAME"" and the dead coins wallet, usually identified as ""0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead"". Why is this important? It reduces the possibility of a rugpull to almost zero, especially if the dead coins wallet is over 50%.

Also watch out if there are too many whales. For example, 10 wallets each holding 3% of total coins is a huge red flag. Abort immediately. A healthy new coin should also have at least 200-300 holders. If it doesn't, also abort immediately.

# 2. Liquidity Pool

The liquidity pool is super important. I usually don't buy any new coin unless the liquidity pool is at least $30k or more. Why? Because scammers and shitcoins rarely provide a liquidity pool of that size. Again, we're greatly reducing our risks here. A locked liquidity pool is also important. Make sure it's locked for a longer period of time. 3 months, 6 months, 1 year or longer are great. You don't want the liquidity pool to unlock tomorrow. You can copy the contract ID and then go to ""PooCoin"" (again, look up the links yourself), then enter the contract URL there, hit enter and on the next page on the left side it will show you something like ""COIN/BNB LP BNB Holdings:"". That's where you want at least $30k or more. If it has a few hundred dollars or even only $5k or $7k, abort immediately.

# 3. Volume

Look at the ""Transfers"" section. If the coin has only 5 holders and no activity, skip it. If you want, bookmark it and come back to check tomorrow. You may have just been too early. If it has only a few transactions every 2-3 hours, also abort immediately. It's not taking off yet. A good number of transactions for a new coin should be about 5-10 per minute.

# 4. Website & Twitter

Make sure the coin has a website and twitter account. If it doesn't have both of them, abort immediately. If it also has a reddit page, a Telegram channel, a Discord, an Instagram page, a YouTube channel, etc. that's even better.

# 5. Coin Name & Design

The logo of the coin and the design of the graphics and website are very important. If it's not attractive, people will not jump in and it won't take off. If the use stock images that you've seen a hundred times elsewhere, abort immediately. The name is also super important. If it has a catchy name like ""Save The World"" it's much more likely to take off than ""Funky Toilet Coin 55"".

# 6. Bonus: Doxxed Team

This one is a HUGE bonus. If the team members publicly identify themselves, for example through YouTube videos or live AMA, it reduces the chance of a scam to almost zero. Why? Because their faces and identities are publicly known and they would almost certainly end up in prison.

# That's it!

Did the coin you investigated fail in any of the first 5 steps? I cannot stress this enough, but: ABORT IMMEDIATELY. Don't invest in it. You will end up losing your money.

Did the coin pass all of the above steps? Great! You ***might*** have found a gem. Do some more research before you jump in and make sure the coin has a real purpose. Remember, things like hodling to get more coins or ""to the moon!"" are not real purposes.

And now we go back to the golden rules. If you are ready to invest in this coin, **remember to only invest $5 for the first 1-2 months** of doing this. I cannot stress this enough. You are learning and you will make mistakes. Make sure you are okay with losing that money because even if a coin matches all of the above, it can still fail for a variety of reasons. If you stick to this rule, you can still make a good amount of money in these 1-2 months. I easily made $10 to $50 with just $5. Sometimes I got out at $3.50 because a coin didn't take off and re-invested elsewhere.

Once you've done the above for 1-2 months and you've noticed any potential mistakes you made, you should be ready to start trading with $10 or $20 per coin (depending on your financial situation).

Two more important things to remember:

1. Early coins take time to take off. It's very possible that your $5 investment will drop to $3 or $2 in that time and go up to $10 and then go back down to $4. It may just sit there doing nothing for 5-14 days. That's absolutely normal.
2. Keep track of what the team is doing during this time. If there are no updates for 2-3 days, sell and get out. A good team should update its holders several times per day through several channels (Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc). It's okay to get only 1 update per day, but less than that is a red flag.

I **always** follow the above rules when trading with small coins and I currently have success with 90-95% of coins that I invest in. Trust me, **I tried to skip some of the rules above and I got burned every time**. Yes, it's a lot of work. Especially if you have to repeat these steps for every single coin you want to investigate, but you will get much faster at it over time. If you end up doing this for a living, you will probably be able to investigate 2-3 coins per minute.

Now, if you excuse me, I need a coffee and relax my fingers a bit. They hurt :P",20344,2021-05-10 18:29:24,2473
BNB,cryptocurrency,Coinbase has become the new Robinhood. They're artificially withholding Algorand withdrawals because of liquidity issues and do not want to lose out on their governance rewards. It has been over 24 hours now and they're pretending it's a technical issue.,"My guess is Coinbase is running on fractional reserves and doesn't wanna lose out on it's governance rewards so they are artificially delaying withdrawals of ALGO. I don't know about you guys but after I get my ALGO's withdrawn I'm finding an alternative to CoinBase. They have officially lost my business which is a shame because I've used them since getting into crypto.

They did this exact same thing before the 1st governance period in September and people lost out on signing up. This is no different than what Robinhood did with GME stock. It just shows that CEX's need regulation desperately and we're currently at the mercy of Coinbase assholes.

There have also been other strange things between Coinbase and Algorand. For the longest time they had Algorand listed as an ERC-20 token. Additionally they commonly do not post updated/correct news for Algorand. A few days ago they listed Securitizes Tokenization of Down Jones Index Funds as happening on Ethereum instead of Algorand, since then they've taken it down from Ethereum but haven't posted it to Algorand news.

This all smells a bit fishy.  I have been having this feeling for a while that coinbase is deliberately trying to undermine Algorand.

Does anyone know of a good alternative to Coinbase and Binance in the US?

&#x200B;

EDIT 1: They canceled my withdrawal after over 24 hours pending and said ""Blockchain transaction was compensated"". I'm wondering if I should try to withdraw again or convert to another coin and transfer off.

EDIT 2: Tried withdrawing again and it canceled almost immediately and said the same thing ""Blockchain transaction was compensated."" I'm pretty sure they still took my .002 ALGO transaction fee though. CB is fucking us over royally.

EDIT 3: Tried withdrawing once more, instant withdrawal cancel with same reason as before. I'm done trying to withdraw tonight. Will try again tomorrow in the AM and update the post.

EDIT 4: I was finally able to withdraw my ALGO's today. Look's like Coinbase most likely saw this post and bought more ALGO. The amount of ALGO in Coinbase 2 doubled and magically withdrawals were reenabled. Which means this was 100% a liquidity issue, and not a technical issue. Thank you everyone for contributing, I'm proud to be a part of this community. The elites get scared when all us little guys work together, never forget how powerful we are when we work collectively. This is the exact reason why we are all here, so huge monolithic entities can't dictate and control our lives without any recourse.

EDIT 5: MAKE COINBASE SQUIRM. Withdraw everything. Coinbase 1 is down to 351 ALGO and Coinbase 2 is down to <1 Million ALGO. Let's clean them out. Hopefully they will learn not to do this again.

EDIT 6: I've been reading some people are still having problems withdrawing. ",11215,2021-12-17 23:06:05,1981
BNB,cryptocurrency,Massive crypto crash in India. Most coins down 25% in just hours as crackpot dictator Modi plans to ban all crypto,"India has just released agenda of parliament session, where it seeks to ban all ""private"" crypto currencies.

Most coins are down anywhere from 15 to 25%. Altcoins have been impacted the most. Even stablecoins have crashed 10% as people are selling that for INR.

Modi has show to be an incompetent ruler, just this week he rolled back farm laws that seeked to destroy farmers livelihood in favour of his industrial buddies who fund his election campaign. Over 100 farmers died due to protests across the country, and then Modi meekly rolled back the laws.

Now he is attacking crypto and seeking to shut this market down.

&#x200B;

As usual, let's start with the worst performer of the month.

&#x200B;

**#10: XRP**

[What a fall from grace.](https://preview.redd.it/uk5i2ffiqh961.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=b39286cfbeeaea09c219560cc16ea66715134ad9)

As I'm sure many of you have been watching, the implosion of XRP has been nothing short of spectacular. What was worth almost triple the last month's price is now down *below the original investment.* And this is WITH Bitcoin almost doubling in price! It's been a sad fall for the former #3 coin on the ladder, being replaced with everyone's good friend Tether. Womp womp. We'll have to see if the coming months have any better news for XRP fans.

&#x200B;

**#9 - XMR**

&#x200B;

[A steady, but ultimately boring grind.](https://preview.redd.it/0dpvcox5rh961.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=20c5bfb6ac9235663608f576870342f0d185eb5e)

Keeping with the pace of last month, Monero continues to underperform the market and only rise slightly. Despite Bitcoin launching into the stratosphere, Monero has been hit with some delistings and uncertainty towards its future on several exchanges. It began to rise with the pack but was slapped down with the bad news. The total XMR value only rose $2 in a month, not the most stellar performance.

&#x200B;

**#8 - SOL**

&#x200B;

[Hills and Valleys.](https://preview.redd.it/w6vyugwwrh961.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=368293571b6a3202e4be5d4fc2e9fd8771f3ffa0)

SOL actually had me worried for a while, with a shattering drop all the way down to $1.17, which marked a very long time low for the coin. However, it has since rallied and almost doubled its price since then, coming in with modest profits instead of large losses. Definitely an interesting price watch for the month.

&#x200B;

**#7 - IOTA**

&#x200B;

[The price appears to be a little... tangled.](https://preview.redd.it/4117j1bfsh961.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=343eaa9da3055e3d3ea59c842e58c80fe7a2500c)

&#x200B;

Another barely-mover for the month, IOTA got us a whopping $5. It seems the price action is somewhat erratic and not necessarily tied to Bitcoin whatsoever, falling on days where Bitcoin does well, and doing well when Bitcoin has off days. Still, it stayed in the same range for most of the month, not really doing anything special or anything dire either. If this was a blue chip stock, you'd probably still love its monthly returns.

&#x200B;

**#6 - NANO**

&#x200B;

[Doing a bit of mountain climbing.](https://preview.redd.it/hmrc5qn2th961.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=c71ad29f1cbf14b7187bc1347141e24b75975965)

Nano came out of nowhere with a mediocre monthly performance, sitting around the dollar range, when suddenly a giant spike of volume propelled the coin as high as +70% of its monthly levels. Since then, it has been largely falling back to earth, but still retains quite a bit of its gains, pushing it firmly over the 100% profit margin. Will Nano continue to show strength as both Bitcoin and Ethereum congest and have wild fee increases, or was this one of many fakeouts?

&#x200B;

**#5 - ADA**

&#x200B;

[A coin on a mission.](https://preview.redd.it/lkmgi0epth961.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5440df0139733e69ed12d28dffd1e0b343c0187)

ADA had a largely mediocre performance most of December, but picked it up as Bitcoin went meteoric, following it to new heights. Excitement of the project getting somewhat close to completion and new buyers entering the market looking at the top 10 had ADA popping off during the last couple of weeks. Can it keep this momentum going into the new year?

&#x200B;

**#4 - VET**

&#x200B;

[A slight fall into a meteoric rise.](https://preview.redd.it/5d2kbyubuh961.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=eacf45d195c5a3fc37f665f9547a22fc22ae2cf8)

VET started off the month strong but lulled a bit as BTC went wild over the Christmas holidays. However, like ADA, it has since shot up incredibly fast and has continued to hold a lot of its gains. Both ADA and VET are inching closer to their 2017-2018 all time highs, nowhere close to the top but unlike a lot of Coins from that era are showing remarkable strength going into the new year.

&#x200B;

**#3 - ETH**

&#x200B;

[Money printer go BRRRR.](https://preview.redd.it/daflae14vh961.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e1e3e936817f23469245532ed1e8d0b271117e1)

ETH's chart is basically what you want to see in any Coin this month, it's basically a straight trend upwards. ETH's momentum this month has been largely unstoppable with ETH2 news coming out and the large DEFI following - It looks positioned to do very well and uphold the big responsibility of being the #2 coin. With news of stablecoins being vetted by the US Government, it may perform even better in the future.

&#x200B;

**#2 - LTO**

&#x200B;

[Disgusting growth.](https://preview.redd.it/nyiecvbnvh961.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=17457a0c5fa91f71e641a510ce8aede7927d180d)

What chart could look better than ETH's, almost doubling in a month, you ask? Well, the answer is simple - LTO. It seems to have caught fire going into the new year, nearly doubling the investment from last month, where it was already the #3 performer. LTO doesn't seem to show any sign of slowing down either, entering the top 200 strong and continuing to grow even as I type this post out. 

&#x200B;

**#1 - DOGE**

&#x200B;

[But of course. Wait, what? What's happening?](https://preview.redd.it/06k1d4smwh961.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd64c5d4766aae602e273139544024f3d01ec2ca)

In a twist basically no one could've expected, DOGE is far and away the biggest and best winner of the month. It's not even remotely close. At one point, DOGE has **QUADRUPLED** the initial investment, and only recently started to peter back down as dumbfounded holders realized their riches. It made XRP's rise last month look like a blip on the radar. Funny, because last month DOGE was a perennial underperformer, but it's tripled its valuation since then. Don't let your memes be dreams.

Despite a great rise, Bitcoin has outperformed the Reddit portfolio this month, but with such a huge rise, that surely wasn't too unexpected. Most alts are playing catchup and it might take a while to see the value of all the coins with a bright and shiny $30k+ Bitcoin in the sky.

Shoutouts to  [u/Wulkingdead](https://www.reddit.com/u/Wulkingdead)  (ETH),  [u/CryptoNarf](https://www.reddit.com/u/CryptoNarf)  (LTO) and  [u/TheRealMotherOfOP](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheRealMotherOfOP) (DOGE) for winning this month. 

Until next month, keep your DOGE miners going!

BNB,cryptocurrency,"Nigerian central bank to freeze Bybit, KuCoin, OKX, Binance user accounts","Tl;Dr Nigeria Central Bank (ie Govt) really cracking down as their fiat shitcoin risks further debasement 

.....

CBN through the circular, also stated that regulated financial institutions dealing in crypto or facilitating payments for crypto exchanges are prohibited.

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has issued a directive requiring all banks and financial institutions to identify individuals or entities engaging in transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges and to ensure that such accounts are put on Post No Debit (PND) instruction for six months.

A “Post No Debit” instruction is a directive issued by a bank or financial institution to restrict certain transactions on a customer’s account. When a PND instruction is in place, the account holder is prohibited from making debit transactions, meaning they cannot withdraw funds or make payments using the affected account.

According to the circular shared with Cointelegraph, the CBN listed Bybit, KuCoin, OKX, and Binance crypto exchanges, stating that they are not licensed for operations in Nigeria.

The bank said it would catch anyone it believes is buying and selling Tether 
USDT on the listed platforms illegally, especially those using peer-to-peer (P2P) methods.

BNB,cryptocurrency,My Binance dust has accumulated to the point where it's worth more than some of my individual coin investments. This is unacceptable.,"I literally have $130 worth of dust...spread across 38 different cryptocurrencies on Binance. How the fuck is this still a thing? I know I can use BNB to clean it up a little, but it's a pain in the ass and it doesn't work on all coins. I suppose I'm grateful for the forced HODL on all the shitcoins I monkey-darted in December. Anyone else noticing their dust is feeling like an investment in and of itself?",507,2018-01-30 22:11:11,210
BNB,cryptocurrency,"Trying to withdraw to UK bank, KuCoin, Binance, Coinbase etc all not working","Hi all,

As the title explains, I’m trying to withdraw my funds to my UK bank account.

KuCoin is asking for additional KYC which is all correct but is saying it failed (apparently this is an on going issues)

Binance are currently doing some changes to the UK verification system

Coinbase have a 24 hour cool down period before you can withdraw

Basically, my question is:

What exchange can I open an account on and send my USDT to straight away and withdraw to my bank account? Where I haven’t got to wait or deal with ‘reorganisation etc’. 

Happy to KYC and all that jazz if it means I can get it out as it’s currently just sat.

Thanks in advance! :)

EDIT: I don’t have an issue with waiting 24 hours, I’m was asking where I am able to send it immediately to a UK bank if that is possible. For context, the account that’s made is not for myself it’s for a family member so asking in regards to that as when I did my account, the opening of it was a lot less strict and didn’t have 24 hour periods and quizzes to take etc., I’m assuming it must be a new UK regulation that’s where the confusion and question comes into play as I have not dealt with this before. Hope that adds some clarity :)",25,2024-04-21 18:43:18,78
BNB,cryptocurrency,"For the newcomers: the top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence.","I tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
15. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
17. **Bitcoin SV (BSV)\*:** Bitcoin Scam Variant
18. **EOS (EOS):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
19. **Elrond (EGLD):** Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR)\*:** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
37. **SushiSwap (SUSHI):** a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
38. **Binance USD (BUSD):** Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.
39. **FTX Token (FTT):** It’s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.
40. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the token of Crypto.com public blockchain, that tries to enable transaction worldwide between people and businesses.
41. **Filecoin (FIL):** a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services.
42. **UMA (UMA):** it builds open-source infrastructure in order to create synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain
43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",14816,2021-02-09 12:03:25,1588
BNB,cryptocurrency,"I bought $1k of the Top 10 Cryptos on January 1st, 2018 (FOUR YEAR REPORT)"," 

[EXPERIMENT – Tracking 2018 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies – FOUR YEAR REPORT – UP +34&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/dzzes3g8ngb81.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e29ebda29cda106029c3f762a91b8b7d815d509)

***Find the full blog post with all the tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the FOUR YEAR REPORT for the 2018 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, NEM, DASH, IOTA,** and **Stellar.**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting every single month for four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and more recently, the [2022 Top Ten a few weeks ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/). ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.
* **December** **Highlights:** A bloody, all-red month
* **Overall since Jan. 2018:** **ETH** solidly in the lead, followed by **BTC** and **ADA.**  After briefly pulling ahead earlier in the year, ***the 2018 Top Ten are now significantly underperforming the S&P 500*** over the same time period.  Q: So, big crypto fail, right?
* A: Only if I stopped after the first year.  The **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 406%, much, much better than traditional markets over the same time period (**fancy new chart at the very bottom of the post).

***Some exciting new changes for*** [2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!***

1. I'll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis (down to two reports per month)
2. Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time. 
3. Factoring in stablecoin gains:  In past years, I have not included the ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports.  This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).
4. Giveaways: Who doesn’t love a good old fashioned giveaway? I’ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I’m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.
5. Friendly competition: I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP r/TotalCryptoMarketCap) to see which one outperforms.

And here we go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Four Year Report – UP 34%

https://preview.redd.it/c3c6wlctpgb81.jpg?width=1056&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=380248b14486edaa5749fba7a390198bf81260a0

Welcome to the four year report!

The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, IOTA, NEM, Dash,** and **Stellar**.  

December highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **100% red month**. **IOTA** falls the least, only down -4% (on news that staking on the Firefly wallet will yield two cryptos, Assembly and Shimmer).
* **ETH** maintains a solid overall lead, **BTC** in second place, **ADA** in third.  Three coins in the green since January 2018.
* After four years, the 2018 Portfolio is +34%, behind the S&P 500’s ROI over the same time period.

## December Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in ranks since January 2018:

https://preview.redd.it/ulc9dwgvpgb81.jpg?width=412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2eadc9a98ec75b726cef37af7cb716fddf3126db

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:** After four years of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have remained.  **NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA**, and **Litecoin** have been replaced by **Binance Coin, Tether**, **DOT, SOL**, **LUNA**, and **USDC.  NEM** looks like it wants to be the first to drop out of the Top 100.

## December Winners and Losers

***December Winners*** –  **IOTA** outperformed the pack, dropping only -4% this month. 100% of the cryptos in the red.

***December Losers*** –   Losing nearly a third of its value, **Litecoin** fell the most, down -30%. **NEM** followed **LTC**, dropping -27% in December.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After four years, here’s a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment. 

https://preview.redd.it/lisz7rgxpgb81.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbf41f94e9716f0140f3a7dfff3f655fa9d21a59

With 11, **Bitcoin** has two more monthly wins than second place **Cardano**.  **NEM** has finished last place most often (12 months out of 48).

**Bitcoin** is still the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).

## Overall Update –  2021 ends with a whimper. After four years, ETH in first place, and Dash and NEM tied for worst overall performance.

After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in [October](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46), the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio continued to lose value.  After four years of holding these cryptos, only 3 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green: **BTC,** **ETH,** and **ADA.**

Overall, first place **ETH** (+413%) is well ahead of **BTC** (+257%) and third place **ADA** (+99%).

The initial $100 invested in first place **ETH** four years ago?  It’s worth $515 today.

**DASH** and **NEM** are virtually tied at the bottom, both down over -86% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.**  The initial $100 invested in each four ago is worth about $13 today.  

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/mldnsr7zpgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=d82435bc0e39657707f2143fb5dd1951f6ddcfd1

End of December 2021 market cap: **$2,211,626,655,207**

The total crypto market dropped significantly in December.  Crypto as a sector is still up +285% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+34%), the return of the S&P (+78%) over the same period of time, and nine of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for **Ethereum)**.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.65T in** [**October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/)**.**

## Bitcoin dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/qygnx0a0qgb81.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=567958cf7214839fa7befa749d61125dade6a9a8

**BitDom** declined a bit in December, ending the month at 40.2%.  When looking at the entire four year 2018 Experiment time frame, **BTC** dominance is near the low end.  For context:   

Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**33% in January 2018**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one).

High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: 

https://preview.redd.it/cxtd9lb1qgb81.jpg?width=339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25b3da0034194812e2b66f977450fff1555b48fb

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost $325 in December.

If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, **the $1000 initial investment would be worth $1,341**, up 34% from [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

Green is unfamiliar territory for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio and a recent development.  Over the first four years of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only ten months of green.  And all ten of the green months have come in 2021. 

Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment four years ago:

https://preview.redd.it/cbumx113qgb81.jpg?width=654&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bba9861143359ff6b70ff0ca8e6ba75de5d00d6

The all time high for this portfolio is [October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46) (+72%).  The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down [\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).   

Remember: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.  The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.

But I didn’t stop the Experiment in 2018:  I invested another $1000 in the ***2019***, ***2020,*** and ***2021*** Top Ten Cryptos as well (***(and, just announced,*** [***again in 2022***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!)***.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?    

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48): up +34% (total value $1,341)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36) up +504% (total value $6,044)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24): up +795% (total value $8,951)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +292% (total value $3,921)

So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,257** ($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).

**That’s up +406%** on the combined portfolios, **down from** [**last month’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47) for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/xcl80o35qgb81.jpg?width=511&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2cd4923360a5492259faf606b3649c893fd4b16

***That’s a +406% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four years in a row.***

## Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  

https://preview.redd.it/3uss07c8qgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e68ae4c88a82ff35b70538ec11dd137e83447e2

After four years: the S&P 500 is up +78% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) would be worth $1,780 had it been redirected to the S&P.  That’s more than double the +34% return of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio over the same period of time.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P:

BNB,cryptocurrency,"Binance(& CZ) lied when they acquired CoinMarketCap and stated that Binance will not influence CMC rankings, and that CMC will be independent. Instead, CMC rankings were massively manipulated and Binance market share had also magically tripled since the acquisition.","Back in 2020, Binance bought the well-known token price aggregator CoinmarketCap. The deal is reported to be worth between 300-400 Million. Interestingly, it is said that BNB used in part as funding for the deal. Of course, CZ made statements that they would not make changes to affect to functioning of CoinMarketCap.

&#x200B;

[From Binance](https://preview.redd.it/6xtmtt8d3axb1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=65680ab3f2c117ffeb91a909930bed32652042a0)

&#x200B;

Interesting assertion there, because that's not what the receipts show. Let me explain.

Binance acquired CMC in around April 2020 and the deal was in the works since late 2019. Just before/during the deal in April, Binance was actual ranked as low as #25 on CMC.

&#x200B;

[April before acquisition](https://preview.redd.it/x4e3313x7axb1.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=96fc80b3a9d5cb306d81ad1d862a25662dc6f974)

However, soon after the deal, Binance were suddenly ranked **#1.** And Binance has, as far as I'm aware,  **NEVER fallen from the #1 rank since this time after they bought CMC.**

&#x200B;

[June after acquisition](https://preview.redd.it/651vm1jt9axb1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=4534becd16378eff0127500bbcf56dc002e4cd81)

What actually happened here was CMC *miraculously* changed they exchange ranking criteria soon after they were acquired that just happened to *massively benefit* Binance. A major factor is the web traffic score. As stated:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6fl7q4rf8axb1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc12dd483edb964d90011af2efc8c577c10b9c8c

Such that the top exchange is always given a perfect score of 1000 which MASSIVE pushes the rankings in favour of Binance. Especially with their expansion at all cost mentality, with their many lawsuits of operating without licenses among of legal troubles in Italy, Japan, Canada, Cayman Islands, Thailand, Malaysia, the UK, the USA, South Africa, and Singapore etc. Basically, if you're the biggest exchange, of course you'll have the best web traffic score, on top of that fact that you can simply expand your marketing budget to receive to most web traffic.

The liquidity Score factor of ranking also tends to unfairly benefit them due to their size.

The thing is that many newcomers to crypto first check crypto prices and many if not most end up on CoinMarketCap. If you can influence CoinMarketCap to make your exchange seem like the best, that is an easy way to secure lots off new users and expand market share.

And consider that Binance's size grew from 16% in 2020 in April before buying CMC to 62% at the end of 2022(before all the CFTC/SEC lawsuits etc), I'd say it was a hell of a return on investment.

BNB,cryptocurrency,I Resent This Sub For Bad Advice On CRO,"When I was new to crypto I was deciding which exchange to use and had decided on crypto.com. At the time crypto.com and their CRO coin had a bit of a bad reputation but I did my own research and determined that the things people were concerned about were growing pains and that an exchange with the domain crypto.com had a very bright future.

After getting my account approved I posted here asking for advice on if I should invest a substantial amount in CRO since I believed crypto.com was destined to become a major player like binance and that inevitably the CRO price would go up.

My post was met with lots of fud and responses from people who had likely been burned or knew nothing about crypto.com and CRO. I should have gone with my gut and my own research however I was brand new to crypto and didn't trust myself.

At this time CRO was about $0.06. Now CRO is $0.50+ and crypto.com has bought the naming rights to the arena where the Lakers play.

Moral of the story is 90% of what's posted here is garbage that won't help you make good investing decisions. Go with your gut.

EDIT: Wow. I knew this sub had some bad advice but I didn't realize how incredibly toxic it had become as well. Everyone was new at some point. There are tons of new people coming here everyday to try and learn more about crypto.

EDIT: One of the mods changed the flair of this post to comedy. That is completely unacceptable. Regardless of if they found my post to be funny it was clearly not intended to be a joke. I have changed it back and if it is changed again I will be reporting the situation to reddit.",5861,2021-11-18 15:29:48,1996

BNB,cryptocurrency,I'm been in crypto since 2013. Maybe 700+ alt coins and many trades. Now a Defi-Crypto Farmer. Here are some of my tips and advice for new-comers.,"As the title says I'm into crypto pretty deep.  I was in crypto briefly in 2013, but only really hit the ground running in 2017 and never looked back.  In 2017 I made all the usual mistakes, got into the wrong coins, entered some dodgy exchanges and sold the wrong coins (like selling Enjin on its first day after investing in the ICO).  In 2018 things got worse, with shitcoins driving the BTC value of my holdings down by half.

Now I'm sitting really pretty and feel like I have ""clicked"" to the point where I am generally making money in crypto and quite a few people ask me for advice on what to do, strategies etc.  Here are some of my tips, observations and ideas.

1. Don't trust anyone.  Assume everybody you are talking to is a friendly thief who wants your money.  That includes people shilling particular coins, or anyone asking for your crypto to invest, to random people that message you.  (And yes ironically this means don't trust me, but you'll see I didn't mention my altcoin holdings and I am deliberately staying quiet on what my 800% defi pool is  :) )
2. Every position you enter should be a fixed percentage of your portfolio.  I prefer 1% for a typical trade.  Risky uniswap gems might be 0.5%, very strong longer term positions say 2-5%.
3. Have your portfolio value in BTC (or ETH if you prefer that).  Your goal is to increase your BTC value.  Each trade should be from BTC, and then exit back out of BTC.  Log all transactions in blockfolio etc under the BTC pair, so you can see how much BTC value you are gaining.  Don't worry as much about USD gains, as in a bull market its easy to make USD value gains.  BTC is the end-game here so you want to accumulate BTC, especially if BTC dominance is falling.
4. Have a portion of your portfolio allocated to farming or staking.  If you have a coin sitting somewhere for ages, ask if there is some way for you to make money from it.  For example, I have a large stack of BTC and ETH, so rather than have it sitting doing nothing, I wrapped the BTC and entered a Sushi Farm.  Months later the rewards from that farm are worth something like 25% of the amount I initially invested.  Every so often, harvest the rewards and either re-farm (compounding) or shift to your long term hold.  Remember compound interest.  There are opportunities for very high returns (without ponzi aspects but be careful) - find those, constantly take and re-invest the income and the gains are quite extreme.
5. Have a dedicated stack of BTC or ETH that is your ""HODL"" portfolio that you never touch.  Preferably in seperate legal entity (like a trust) than what you trade with.  This will help for taxes.  Every so often, move some profits into that long term stack.   I don't do anything with that stack at all, it is just my safe holdings.
6. Spend as much time learning about tax as you do trading.  Tax is something you kind of need to understand upfront - you can get way more rekt from bad tax approaches than you make gains with good trading.  And keep your records safe - download all trade histories at the end of every quarter.
7. Use telegram (or discord).  Find really helpful smart and useful people and stick to them.  Find helpful trading groups.  Eventually they will be a vital source of information or just ways to bounce ideas off.  Check out my previous post for a full guide on ""must have"" telegram groups.
8. Read the crypto news as much as you can.  Its amazing how often something pops up (e.g. grayscale announcing new trusts with other coins) and there is still a decent amount of time to buy.  And always have some BTC on an exchange ready to buy on such an opportunity.  Again, telegram is great for this as you can quickly see tweets or news-links being shared.
9. Have a preset % of gain or losses whereby you will sell if it reaches that.  For example, for most coins, if a coin ever goes up more than 30% vs BTC in a day I always sell.  95% of the time that works out as better than holding.  In the rare event I double my position I always sell the principal immediately (I did this twice this year - with Ethernity and Blind Boxes).
10. Always have an idea as to what the current ""climate"" is in terms of what is moving and in favour.  Crypto markets often move with certain sectors at a time.  For example, if you look at the Coin Gecko categories list, you can immediately spot what is ""hot"" right now.  Last month it was NFTs, so I was heavy in that space, but now that sector is cooling.  The binance smart chain and exchange coins are doing very well right now - if that is the case what else might move?  Well other low gas blockchains could be an idea - especially if they have defi - so Avax, Raydium etc are all moving too.  Soon it might well be BTC's time to gain as the expense of alts.  You should be rotating in and out of positions to try and go with the ebb and flow of the market.
11. For newcomers, start with basic stuff like accumulating bitcoin, learning to use a wallet, security etc.  Don't just dive in and ape into defi coins, wsb style.  It may suck that it feels like you are missing all the gains from the ""hot"" new coins, but it will equally hurt if you are just burning through your capital.
12. Look out for free crypto opportunities.  They key here is sorting out the gems from the scams.  This isn't just staking etc but also things like reddit moons and airdrops.  A lot of people are even ""airdrop farming"" whereby you have wallets that carry out certain activities deliberately to try and qualify for future airdrops.  Coin market cap earn and coinbase earn are two more.  Even something like the binance ""dust"" feature to turn dust into bnb is a way of generating some more bnb (even if its tiny).  Check out my previous post on free crypto and ways to get passive income
13. For farming, make sure you are using the right apps like zapper or apy vision to track all your positions, your yield and any impermanent loss.  That will also help with tax records down the track, should you need it.  Watch out for farming on the ETH network as your gas fees will chew up any gains if you have small positions.  Check out my previous post of sushi farming for how the rewards and gains work
14. Track all your numbers, your gains, your investments and portfolio change religiously, preferably in an excel document.  That way you'll know how you are performing and if something is going wrong.  Again, I wish I had done this more in 2018.
15. Have an ""emergency reserve"".  For me, this is actually my stock positions, many which are crypto related, but you could have gold or cash (I especially like the idea of something like stable coins lent on FTX at a decent interest rate).  If we get some kind of crypto turbo dump which is 40%, you can then have that as money on the side-lines ready to buy.
16. Constantly educate yourself.  For me, I still need 3-4 hours a day to research and learn about crypto.  I find crypto podcasts and even youtube vital sources of information, provided you are listening to the right people.  Mix up your education with news, technical strategies, trading updates, altcoin news and even just the general philosophy behind sound money and financial sovereignty.
17. If you win or lose on a trade, delete that coin from blockfolio immediately.  Why?  Because you have exited that position, and seeing it jump up again in price is just going to torment you.  You've made the decision to sell, don't even up revenge trading where you come back and try and get your losses back on the same trade.
18. Never margin trade UNLESS it is only because you want to minimise your funds at risk on an exchange.  Even then I'd avoid it.  Unfortunately many exchanges make this very hard to use - and there are confusing terms and default options which can rekt you (for example, positions that will drain your other funds instead of liquidiating the trade if falls too much).  In fact, I avoid almost all USD pairings and only trade BTC pairing, unless very special circumstances are in play (such as ripple being delisted from coinbase).
19. Never hold more than around 10 coins.  I used to have up to 40 at a time, it became impossible tracking them in terms of activity, prices, and god the horrors of trying to maintain enough wallets for them.  10 is enough diversification.  I used to have a ""bag"" of around 15 moonshots - that strategy never worked as even if one ""Gem"" actually made it big, the losses from the other ones cancelled out.  Typically if I had a huge gain from one of my coins, I sell back to BTC and waits for other opportunities.  This isn't Pokemon - don't try and ""catch them all"".
20. Falling in love with alt-coins is like falling in love at a stripclub.  Yes trade them.  But just be conscious that their chances of beating BTC long term are very unlikely.  Just look at all my 2013 gems (peer coin, feather coin etc).  Heck I bought World-Coin because I read about a ""bitcoin genius teenager"" who made millions from crypto and said World-Coin was the next bitcoin.  And I've made my mistakes as well going forward, holding on for dear life for nano (yes I know its fast and instant!) and grin.  I think the tech for both coins is great, that doesn't mean its a great trade.  If you want to marry your alt-coins then you will be lucky if you only lose half your money like a real world divorce :)
21. EDIT. Bonus one.  Always learn from your losses (and I have MANY).  I like to think of crypto as like a computer game where you are gaining new skills.  Think of RPG games like Baldur's Gate or Warcraft.  You can earn money or experience, and use that to gain new items or skills that protect you against certain things.  So maybe you lost $500 to a ""rug-pull""?  Well do your research and figure out how to avoid that next time.  Maybe you'll spend the next 2 weeks mad about it, but next time a potential rug-pull project comes along you'll dodge it - congratulations you now have learned ""immunity to rug-pulls"".   Keep learning and gaining more experience and you'll start avoiding all the traps.
22. EDIT 2:  You are going to have MANY scenarios where you see a coin that has gone x1000 or to some ridiculous crescendo, where you feel utterly compelled to buy to avoid missing out.  This is the obvious trap (if you want an example of this look at Safemoon right now.  Bitconnect was the one in 2017 and there are others).  At some point bitcoin or ethereum will do a similar run up, and many people outside crypto will do the same thing.  Yes this can be irresistible but you must resist the temptation - think of the cryptos has being a bunch of boats on the wharf, and there are thousands of boats.  Every day another hundred turn up.  Why are you going to try and jump across the water to get to the boat that is already leaving, when if you wait a bit another few dozen will turn up in five minutes?  You'll just fall in the water and miss out on those new boats!
23. If you must trade as a new-comer, I highly suggest trading the smaller / middle cap BTC pairs.  Not the USD or margin pairs.  Certainly not something like futures contracts on FTX.  Why?  Because if you are on bitmex / bybit / ftx etc you are swimming with the whales and sharks, quant funds, robo-traders and the like.  If you entered the casino for the first time in your life, would you immediately go to the blackjack table with James Bond and Dr Evil?  The smaller BTC pairs are more likely to have less experienced traders - my trades actually went positive once I moved from USD pairs on margin exchanges to spot BTC trades with altcoins.
24. Last edit before bed (I promise).  The chances are, crypto is still cyclical.  That means we will have another bear market, or at least a very long boring period of no gains.  If you have just joined crypto, you probably won't ""make it"" this cycle, as we may only have 6 months to a year to go.  I actually lost money (a lot) in BOTH the 2013 and 2017 bull markets (-50% and -85%, respectively).   All of my gains were made in the bear market when I was buying BTC and alts when BTC was in the 3ks.  The ""will you make it?"" test isn't coming now when the market seems to be going infinitely up and everybody is winning.  That test comes when everybody is selling and it seems like you are the only buyer.  And yeah, thousands of alt coins will suffer or die at that point.   So be around to scoop up the ashes - don't be the ashes!  This is all a larger part of learning to move with the cycles.

Anyway these are the ones that come to mind, hopefully that is helpful!  No doubt I'll edit this post and add a few more.",10416,2021-04-11 02:37:48,1307
BNB,cryptocurrency,Idgaf... I'm leaving my coins on an exchange where it is insured... Too many scams out there that even crypto vets are falling for.,"Last night several threads warned about Trezor phishing scam and almost on cue, today I read a post by 7 year crypto veteran that he fell for it and lost everything, about $72,000 in Bitcoin.

It can happen to anyone. You're tired, arguing with your gf, distracted, etc... nobody is perfect. He lost everything. I can't afford that. Shit gives me nightmares.

I've been intending to buy a Trezor for some time now, but I keep hesitating. I've been so nervous about the whole thing. What if I lose my seed phrase? I live n NYC, someone breaks into my apartment, a fire, collapse, etc.. call me paranoid.

Now that Coinbase One offers insurance, I'm not even going to worry about cold storage. I sleep better this way. I don't care about all the ""not your keys not your coins"" arguments. I have a legally enforceable contract with Coinbase now that I pay for.

True, it's price is kinda steep at $30 a month, but to me it's worth it. It comes with no trading fees which sweetens the pie. Also comes with ""priority"" customer support, which I tested and only had to wait 2 minutes before I was speaking to a live agent.

So yeah, fuck that. I'm just too paranoid. If US gov ever looks like it's on the verge of collapse, then yeah, I might put it in cold storage before I bounce out of the country. Until them I rest easy with my coins insured on an exchange.

Let the hate begin...

BNB,cryptocurrency,Friend had his coins disappear from binance Australia ,Just asking for any advice here. I co worker of mine had some coins (several) on binance Australia. Value probably about $5000. He doesn’t check this account often as he was using it as a kind of crypto stash account for the future. He logged back in a couple of months ago and the coins were all gone. He couldn’t even find transaction history for buying the coins. He has contacted binance in regard to this and they also say they can’t see any transaction history. They have made him do a verification of the account by sending his passport saying they would contact him in 72 hours. That was about 2 weeks ago. Any advice appreciated not really sure what happened or what he should do going forward. ,27,2024-03-29 10:02:06,74
BNB,cryptocurrency,"So... are we going to ignore that TRON (TRX), with 7.5 BILLION market cap, is pretty much following LUNA's footsteps?","[TRON (TRX) is currently the #14 coin by market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/). The coin has seen an insane increase over the past couple months.

TRON has recently launched its algorithmic stablecoin [USDD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usdd/). The algorithm governing the stablecoin’s dollar-peg is an arbitrage trade between USDD and TRX, Tron's network’s native token. *Hmm... this reminds me of something but I can't put my finger on it....*

Now here's this week's best offer! [You can earn up to 57% through sun.io's LP!](https://imgur.com/a/JoFQgSH) What a great deal.

According to [Defillama](https://defillama.com/peggedassets/stablecoins) USDD is #10 stablecoin by market cap, with a 20% increase over the past week, this figure is up from $90 million recorded during its day of launch on **May 5, 2022**. *Hmm... I have a vouge memory of something that happened in early May 2022...*

Oh and we haven't even checked the **project's founder, Justin Sun.**

Let's get started:

Justin Sun launched TRON's whitepaper during the ICO craze in 2017, days before China's ban on ICO's. He raised $70 million and left the country. Sun had been **tipped off by Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance.** Does this also sound familiar....? 

On top of that. [it's been also reported that he copy pasted the project's whitepaper from another coin](https://coincentral.com/community-accuses-tron-plagiarizing-whitepaper/). This only adds to the pile of cards that his so called ""algorithmic stablecoin"" is a scam waiting to collapse.

It is no coincidence that Justin also left China, days after the ICO ban was announced.

On top of all that, it's been reported that:

* He hosted a ton of fake giveaways in 2019 announcing fake winners and retracting prizes.

* He announced fake partnerships with big organizations such as Liverpool F.C., who have denied connections.

* It's been reported that Justin has sold most of his TRON coins after the ICO and bought a large chunk of ETH. Some say he owns more ETH than the projects' Co-Founder Vitalik.

[You can read more here](https://www.theverge.com/c/22947663/justin-sun-tron-cryptocurrency-poloniex)

So, what do we make of all these? Justin Sun, the creator of TRX and USDD, not only literally copy pasted everything, he has also been involved in a huge amount of sketchy dealings and scams. 

My hope is that people like Justin and projects like LUNA and TRX are wiped off entirely from the market, for this is the only way to move forward and build something meaningful.

BNB,cryptocurrency,Doge has a single wallet with more than 23.17% of all the Dogecoin in circulation and it can be rugpulled at ANY moment.,"For comparison, the largest Bitcoin wallet is the Binance coldwallet and it holds approximately 1.40% of the current circulating supply while the largest Ethereum wallet is the  Eth2 Deposit Contract which holds 7.6% of all Ethereum.

The largest Dogecoin wallet, which currently holds $5 Billion in Doge of its $21 Billion market cap is very mysterious. It was thought to be Robinhood or some other exchange but that has previously been dismissed by the Robinhood CEO himself.

[Doge wallet with 23.17&#37; of the entire circulating supply](https://preview.redd.it/go0edwi8nic81.png?width=1436&format=png&auto=webp&s=67d99e6b36c56bcf24470f6676421f98dee70f4f)

Any wallet that holds over 23.17% of the current supply has more than enough to rug pull an entire coin to near zero. Even half of that can cause the price to crash to unrecoverable levels due to how liquidity and market caps work.

According to Forkast,

>For new cryptocurrencies, if the top 10 wallets hold **more than 20% of the** token, or worse, a large percentage of the token is held in a single wallet, then this is a dangerous sign of a potential rug pull.

**For Doge, the top 14 wallets own  46.11% of all Dogecoin.**

TLDR: Avoid any Cryptocurrency that has wallets capable of rug pulling the entire project. Don't let a false sense of security take over just because Doge is popular. It still does not make Doge immune to rugpulls. Never let yourself be at the mercy of a single wallet.

EDIT: The amount of people on the comments claiming it to be the Robinhood wallet DESPITE Robinhood's CEO publicly stating the company does not hold that much Doge as far back as May is the same argument Shib shillers make. It is careless copium.

BNB,cryptocurrency,There isn't DOGE adoption. The opposite is happening. Daily transaction count (15k) is the lowest since 2017.,"[https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/dogecoin-transactions.html#alltime](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/dogecoin-transactions.html#alltime)

This is why DOGE was nothing else than FOMO and viral investing. This is why DOGE will fall from the Top10. Will it come back? Sure, after crashing to 1 cent, the viral cycle can start again. And it will be temporal again.

15474 transactions. The lowest in almost 4 years, in the middle of a bull run. We had 20-30k transactions in 2018-2020, during the crypto winter.

How many transactions other chain process?

* Cardano 80k
* Bitcoin Cash 100k
* Litcoin 150k
* Avalancha 170k
* Bitcoin 250k
* Tezos 300k
* Ethereum 1.2M
* Algorand 1.3M
* Fantom 1.5M
* Polygon MATIC 5.5M
* Binance Smart Chain 9M
* Solana 15M (not counting votes)

Most of these chains are doing transactions not far away from their ATH. DOGE ATH happened in 2013. 8 years ago!! after that, it had 8 Pumps and 7 dumps. The 8th dump is happening right now. The code is a fork of a fork of Litecoin done in 2013, and it hasnt improved sifnicantly since then. It doesnt have the throughput to be a global payment system. Elon just loves the attention and the marketing points. After being in the media so long time, adoption decreased. Investors multiplied by 10, by almost none of you are actually using it, just investing for the profits. 

Invest as you will, just be aware, that those funds could be lost. Don't invest more you can afford to lose. 

PS: Why do I attack DOGE? Because I think it's a distraction for Crypto and damage its credibility. Hundreds of thousands of people will be burnt in this FOMO, and will distrust crypto in the future. It has provided ammo to skepticals, and the reputation damage will take time to repair. Shiba, RocketCum, and many other shitcoins, are the worst of this space.",4678,2021-09-22 08:52:16,1600

________________________________________________________________

That's right, everyone always talks about their portfolios, let's see if Redditors can pick a portfolio that'll outperform the rest (Or, alternatively, go down in flames) and leave it for a year. At the end of the year (November 5th, 12 months from now till the day) I'll cash out the proceeds and donate it to the 10 people who posted the comments that got the highest upvotes in this post - Or in other words, the people who ended up choosing the Coins that will be bought.

Last cycle, I converted 10,000 Moons into USD for this experiment, now it's up to you to choose what Cryptos it buys.


________________________________________________________________

**Here's the deal and the rules:**

- You comment on this thread. You can either comment a top level comment with a coin you think should be chosen, or you can support someone else's pick. If you are doing a top level (Coin pick) comment, **please explain why this coin should be chosen.**

- You list a coin available on Binance.com - It'll be the Casino I'm using for this experiment.

- The top 10 upvoted (In total votes) comments will have that Coin purchased as 10% of the total:

- [0.0353 BTC / 10 = 0.00353 BTC to 10 coins](https://i.imgur.com/S6cTs59.png) - Or about $50 USD/Coin.

- Coins will be purchased in order of upvotes. Will try to divide them evenly but the last place ones might lose out a little bit.

- Coins will be tracked each month in a post, which will coincide with the day after Moon Distribution. I'll try to make it funny and informative.

BNB,cryptocurrency,A Beginner's Guide to Cryptocurrency Wallets,"A cryptocurrency wallet is basically a software that enables you to track, send and receive coins through the blockchain like a bank account. Every wallet has a public key and a private key, but we'll get back to this later. But first...

# Why do you need a wallet?

There's an old saying in Tennessee that says: **""Not your keys, not your coins.""** What it actually means is that if you keep your cryptocurrencies on an exchange (such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken), you don't actually own those coins, because you don't have the keys to the related wallet. You gain access to those wallets by logging into these exchanges, but your account can - theoretically - be deleted in the blink of an eye, or the exchange can get hacked, attacked, etc. And with it, your funds can disappear forever. If you want to learn more about this, make sure to look up Mt. Gox's hacking. It is an unfortunate event, but one that puts you on guard. 

So you already know that you need to own your keys in order to own your coins. **But what are these keys?**

Your **public key** is what identifies your account on the network. Think of it as your email address, because when someone wants to send you cryptocurrency, they will send it to this address. 

Your **private key** is a string of 64 characters that can be generated from a 12-word seed phrase. It basically serves as the password of your account. It is used to sign transactions and to prove that you own the related public key. 

See, it's not that complicated, is it?

# About wallet types

There are 4 types of wallets that you should be using. Ideally, you can pick the one that fits your crypto habits the most. You should avoid using Web wallets. As always, if you can, please pick the safest wallet type in order to minimize the risk of losing your cryptos. 

**Hardware / Offline / Cold Wallet** \- an offline storage device (e.g. hard disk, USB stick). You might've heard the names Ledger or Trezor, these are the 2 biggest brands at the moment. The ledger supports over 1200 cryptocurrencies, while Trezor supports over a thousand. It is also the most secure way to store your cryptocurrencies. 

**Mobile Wallet** \- applications that are installable on your mobile phone. Beware that even though an app can hold crypto, it doesn't mean it is NOT custodial. (e.g. Coinbase has a mobile app, but it is custodial, meaning that they control your coins.) Exodus or Atomic mobile apps are recommended if you decide to create a mobile wallet.

**Desktop Wallet** \- wallets that are installable on different desktops and are compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. Your keys are stored on your computer, and you can use this wallet even when you're offline. Note: Desktop wallets tend to be more advanced than mobile wallets, and usually come with more technically complicated features that can increase privacy or allow for more flexibility when it comes to signing transactions.

**Paper wallet** \- a paper wallet is essentially a piece of paper including your public and private key, or a QR code (so that you can quickly scan them and add the keys to a software wallet to make a transaction). It's a really safe way to store your cryptos because your keys are not connected to any servers. The only way someone can steal your cryptos is if they steal this paper.

# The Best Hardware Wallets

**Ledger Nano (S and X)** \- The most popular hardware wallet brand in the world, currently sells 2 different sticks. The S is the cheaper alternative, but if you handle transactions between multiple cryptocurrencies frequently, the larger storage of the Nano X should be more convenient. The Nano X also has Bluetooth 5.0 support. You can read more about Ledgers on their website. 

Beware that **Ledger was targeted by a cyberattack that led to a data breach** in July 2020. A larger subset of detailed information has been leaked, approximately 272,000 detailed information such as postal address, last name, first name, and telephone number of our customers. However, not a single coin was stolen as hackers didn't gain access to private keys. Please keep this in mind when making your decision. 

**Trezor (One and Model T)** \- Trezor is the other popular hardware wallet brand. The Trezor One is the cheaper alternative ($59), while the Model T is more expensive but comes with extended functionality and additionally supports cryptocurrencies such as ADA, XMR, XTZ, etc.

Despite the security of hardware devices themselves, **the weakest link is always the people using them.** If possible, avoid buying used hardware wallets, even though both Trezor and Ledger have security measures to avoid the attempt of installing malwares.

# The Best Desktop Wallets

**Exodus** \- a very user-friendly and easy to understand, reliable wallet. As of now, it is probably the most popular desktop wallet. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux as well. 

**Atomic** \- it is also a user-friendly and reliable wallet. Atomic supports 500+ assets and allows staking various cryptocurrencies. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Of course, there are several other reliable desktop wallets, but these two proved to be the most user-friendly and easy to use wallets so far. As always, please DYOR!

**If you decide to go with a mobile wallet** (instead of a paper, hardware, or a desktop wallet), Exodus or Atomic are both available on iOS and Android. Please avoid installing 10+ crypto wallet applications on your phone, because you'll make it impossible to keep track of your keys and passwords eventually.

Last piece of advice: always be cautious and double-check everything. Keep your devices malware-free, and don't click on anything suspicious (such as emails from ""Binnance"", crazy bonus links from ""Coimbase"", etc.)

BNB,cryptocurrency,The ultimate guide to earning passive income with cryptocurrencies 📌,"Most of us are here to make money. Some people try trading, while others just HODL and check the prices every 5 minutes. And even though many of us have made decent amounts, neither of these two ways can guarantee a reliable source of income.

But what if I told you that apart from trading and holding, there are other ways that can make you money in the crypto space? Well, in this guide I have collected most of these methods so that you can pick out the ones you prefer, and start earning passive income with crypto.

# #1 - Staking

Staking is an activity where a user locks or holds his funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to participate in maintaining the operations of a proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain system. It is similar to crypto mining in the sense that it helps a network achieve consensus while rewarding users who participate.

Staking can be an excellent way to increase your cryptocurrency holdings with minimal effort. You can stake various cryptocurrencies such as DOT, ADA, AVAX etc. By doing this, you earn a certain APY (annual percentage yield), usually between 4%-25% depending on how long you are willing to lock your cryptos.

You can either stake a coin from a wallet such as Exodus, or you can stake your coins on a few exchanges (e.g. Binance). As always, DYOR before locking your crypto for 30-60-90 or more days.

# #2 - Airdrops

An airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. Small amounts of the new virtual currency are sent to the wallets of active members of the blockchain community for free or in return for a small service, such as retweeting a post sent by the company issuing the currency.

The famous Uniswap airdrop made 49 million UNI claimable for users whose address has ever called the Uniswap v1 or v2 contracts. Each address could claim 400 UNI (worth ≈ $7400), which is a nice sum for doing almost nothing.

It is worth keeping an eye out for possible future airdrops, so make sure to follow the news! :)

# #3 - Reddit Moons

Most of the users here already know, but for those who don't (and with a large influx of new members, it's possibly a lot of you guys), you can earn Moons for upvotes on this subreddit. But what are Moons?

""Moons exist as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, where they are managed by a suite of smart contracts that handle balances, transfers, distribution/claiming, and purchasing Special Memberships. The smart contracts and mobile apps have been reviewed and audited by Trail of Bits, an independent security firm with blockchain expertise.

As blockchain tokens, Moons are independent of Reddit. Once you’ve earned them, neither Reddit nor moderators can take your Moons away or decide what you do with them. They’re all yours.""

In order to be able to claim your Moons, you'll need to download the Reddit mobile app and set up your vault (click on your icon at the top left of the home page).

The main purpose for moons is to own a share of the community (vote on governance/distribution proposals) as well as redeem them for the premium membership, which allows you to change the color of your username, embed gifs in comments, add custom flair, etc.

To sum it up, you earn Moons by commenting and posting - something that you'd normally do anyway. Just don't forget to create your vault!

In case you want to, you have the option to sell your Moons. The current price of Moons is $0.071380 / coin (15/02/2021), and you can only sell your moons on Honeyswap at the moment.

# #4 - Nexo, Celsius, etc.

This method is very similar to what banks offer on your investment, except that on Nexo and Celsius you can earn up to 6-14% just by keeping your crypto, stablecoin or fiat on their site.

While the saying ""not your keys, not your coins"" is true, these companies are insured and have never been hacked before. As far as I know, both of these sites have a daily payout system, and you can deposit and withdraw funds whenever you want to.

If you choose this method, it might be worth splitting your investment between these sites in order to prepare for the worst and also to be able to claim offers and bonuses on both sites once available.

# #5 - Coinbase Earn

Not a ""passive"" method, but I felt like I should add this one to the list. Many of you are already familiar with the ""It ain't much, but it's honest work"" meme referring to Coinbase Earn, a program where you can earn a few coins by watching educational videos of certain cryptocurrencies and solving the quizzes that follow said videos.

In my country, currently Graph, Compound, XLM, CELO, Band, and Maker are available through Coinbase Earn, and if you complete all of these crypto's quizzes, you can earn up to $30-$40. In crypto, of course.

Compared to the previous methods, it truly ain't much, but it's honest work, and who knows how these coins will perform in the upcoming years. Worth a shot!

\*\*\*Edit \*\*\*

TLDR summary

&#x200B;

The crux is they don't spend money on It and make money in doing so.

&#x200B;

Ask the exchange(s):

While they may say ""we dont make money indirectly off insurance funds"" they absolutely do.

its your right as an investor to have this detail You have every right to know the details of an insurance fund you are paying into.

Since everyone accepts that a lot of exchanges do this, other exchanges do it to. I literally have screenshots of conversations that say this much.

You are being throttled out. They can indeed scale up at a cost.

If for some reason they can not they have a fiduciary duty the moment they take your funds to tell you the risk of their incapable IT architecture and settings. Moreover, they could just install a kill switch that ends trades without penalty if the web servers go down or they exceed band width.

As cost-effective as it is to build in a kill switch as a solution its not profitable to exchanges that are having a liquidity crisis. Assets on exchanges are becoming more scarce. (reference IEP 1559 and many other facets)

If an exchange restricts your access they should still not be placing higher priority orders via the OTC desk while you are locked out. This should also be disclosed.

While they may say we dont make money indirectly off insurance funds they absolutely do.

Cloudflare is the brand of edge network they are using as a server to facilitate HSTS protocol controls to throttle down access to their whim.  I didn't want to get so deep as to dive into protocol-level details in this post as I was speaking to a very broad audience.

Hey all,

&#x200B;

I used to design data centers ( I became a full time crypto trader) and I got very concerned when i saw them using tech i am very familiar with to try and steal peoples money via liquidations.

Trading leverage is risky but to for a company to game the system with thier data center design is just not ok.

&#x200B;

below is a screen shot of Kucoin denying access to the website on peak times using Cloudflare.

&#x200B;

Cloudflare is used for 2 purposes. To stop a DDOS attack ( millions of bots refreshing a web browser to crash a server) and to defer traffic to redundant servers when server loads peak.

Essentially they are treating all their customers like a DDOS attack and saving money on not having a redundant webserver at AWS ( Amazon Data centers).

If I was wrong I figure someone would at least talk to me about it.

but when i add this server denail access stuff on top of little nuansces like them removing the liquidation price on margin to increase customer risk I got more concerned.

&#x200B;

Their servers are going down way too often as well [https://downdetector.com/status/kucoin/archive/](https://downdetector.com/status/kucoin/archive/)

Essentially by not spending more on IT they make more money.

When the servers go down they are still processing institutional orders via the OTC desk

The link below is not spam its to the Cloudflare's website ( kucoins vendor)

[https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/)

They are treating their own customer base as a threatening attack like DDOS

Kucoin is assigned a Cloudflare Ray ID, an identifier like a phone #. Kucoin ray id 69fc3e2db9e762eB

Kucoin uses Amazon Data centers or AWS, they could recitify this whole issue by using geo load balancers aka a gateway load balancer

[https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/aws-gateway-load-balancer-is-now-available-in-additional-9-regions/](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/aws-gateway-load-balancer-is-now-available-in-additional-9-regions/)

Instead they let the servers go down and get laggie to make extra money. They save money on IT and make money off liquidations

Roughly 5% of their revenue comes from liquidations.

Helpdesk wont even acknowledge this; I designed data centers, I know how this works for anyone who has questions

I posted this on the Kucoin subreddit and ""no surprise"" I was banned.

It legitimizes what I am saying as if I was wrong their help desk could have asked me for my support ticket

How else do they know ( they are knowingly doing this)

&#x200B;

How this works is Amazon data centers charges you by the cumulative resources you consume. ( cpu, gpu, data storage, ram etc)

In these settings you can throttle the virtual machine/ cloud servers resources forcing it to go down. I am not implying that they are doing this.

I am saying they are knowingly using settings that let the server go down repeatedly. There are formulas to calculate loads on concurrent users. They are clearly not using settings or intentionally using settings that trip the server to go down.

If you dig through this archive you can see when outages are being reported. They get a system notice that they hit a threshold of resource utilization.

[https://downdetector.com/status/kucoin/archive/](https://downdetector.com/status/kucoin/archive/)

Now in the event, you have a crazy anomaly Cloudflare and Amazon have the ability to redirect to a redundant location with a technology called geo load balancing

Notice in my screenshot that it says there is a gateway issue

that link talks about load balancing the gateway ( offloading the processing power)

They VERY MUCH KNOW THEY ARE DOING THIS

&#x200B;

Infact I let the CEO know via PM

the date on that PM is Sept 29th

They had another outage this past weekend and even today

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Essentially thier help desk team does nothing and they keep passing you back and forth until you give up.

In professional management the term for this is ""being managed out""

&#x200B;

\*\*I share these communications just to show THEY DAMN WELL KNOW AND NEVER DISPUTE WHAT I SAY\*\*\*\*

They are getting system notices  via email from amazon (e.g. You are at 89% cpu utilization you need to scale or you may face faliure)

Their Amazon (AWS) sales guy is calling them every day trying to sell them more services.

&#x200B;

e.g. Hey i am your hypothetical Amazon Sales Guy "" I noticed you guys are throttling cpu load on webservers, can I offer you a bigger package and maybe we should tal;k about fail over locations incase your server goes down under load.

&#x200B;

frankly, I would bet my life on it that they know this is an issue and why

&#x200B;

There isnt a data center architect  (what I did) on the planet that couldn't answer why their servers are going down.  This is 101 level stuff

&#x200B;

They also have the ability to kill the back end server ( where trades happen) this is done on all major exchanges  like the HK ex

[https://www.hkex.com.hk/News/Market-Communications/2016/160425news?sc\_lang=en](https://www.hkex.com.hk/News/Market-Communications/2016/160425news?sc_lang=en)

&#x200B;

and Chicago CME

&#x200B;

Essentially the webserver sends a hearth beat signal  ( its literally called that) if the heartbeat is not heard all trades pause ( a kill switch)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat\_(computing)#:\~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20heartbeat,parts%20of%20a%20computer%20system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_(computing)#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20heartbeat,parts%20of%20a%20computer%20system).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is VERY common design work, like windows to a house level ... for lack of better comparrison

In Kucoins instance they let the webserver go down but the back end server was still moving. All the whales use OTC desks and have dedicated access. So they processed the whale orders and let all of us burn alive and took our money

Its safe to say they have ZERO plausible deniability

&#x200B;

I can share screen shots with thier help desk if its hellp ful

&#x200B;

I went so far as to volunteer to fix the issue for free,

The CEO went so far as to acknowledge the outage happened and they would do the right thing but it was all BULL SH!t

IT was a PR stunt and no one go money anywhere close to thier losses. Here is his reddit post

Most of us are doing crypto to better our lives, it's a little hopium in a dark f\*\*king world. We all need to stand together and speak up

\*\*\*edit\*\*\*

We tagged their executive team in the comments

I want to give them the benefit of the doubt even now. So far thier only response was to ban me from kucoin and hide the moderator list after i tagged them on the kucoin subreddit.

Should they not comment or address the issue, I will have all the answers I need.

If they do show up we have a chance to ask questions.

If they have nothing to hide, they won't be hiding.

&#x200B;

If they do show up, I implore all of you to come forward on this very thread and step up to the mic and ask them about your issues.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thank you for all the love guys. I am mostly a lurker

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*edit\*

There are people asking if this is possible an honest IT mistake. Like they messed up and don't know any better

Well I hope not

Would you run a business solely on the web that handles over $1 billion dollars of transactions daily without a single redundancy fail-over site for high availability which is a ubiquitous industry standard?

If you had issues with web server outages more than all of your competitors and relied on transaction fees for income... there would be an obvious question of ""doesn't downtime hurt your income from transaction fees if your customer cant process transactions?

If they are honest... they are so grossly incompetent they are still just as big of a threat.

Occam's razor is **a principle of theory construction or evaluation** according to which, other things equal, explanations that posit fewer entities, or fewer kinds of entities, are to be preferred to explanations that posit more.

So what is more plausible is"" a company rose to #3 by market cap and is processing over 1 billion a day in transactions but yet never heard of the industry-standard redundancies.

They cant figure out how to stop the loss of income from amissing transaction fees

They also never address that they have more outages during periods of high liquidity transfer ( not volume) than all of their competitors.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yet still, appease their institutional customers moving $35 million in assets or more?

or

&#x200B;

That they are pulling an industry-standard broker tactic of pulling out the proverbial buy/ sell button of securities when they may have a liquidity crisis. \* Like Robinhood did with GMC, AMC, and Dogecoin. While still catering to whales

&#x200B;

I hope they show up to answer these questions.

Because of the derivative funding fees, the constant issues with withdrawals (often you can't withdraw), deleting stop losses, not triggering stop losses and removing the liquidation price  on margin contracts increasing the risk of liquidation makes me want to ask a lot of questions

&#x200B;

When I started to ask these questions I got instantly banned.

&#x200B;

When I looked up there moderators and saw they were teh executives of the comapny and tagged them, they made the mod list private.

&#x200B;

Through this all, I am still willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, but your don't get to lock me out of my house and then burn it to the ground.. subsequently blame me for it.

They tried to silence me when I asked questions.

There is something off here!

BNB,cryptocurrency,DeFi Explained: The FULL Guide,"I've noticed that people in this sub are getting more and more interested in DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications. With this guide I would like to help you getting started with learning the basic fundamentals of DeFi and setting up your wallet and tools. I tried to make this guide as complete as possible.

# Fundamentals

Let's start with some fundamentals first.

# What is Decentralized Finance

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a movement that uses decentralized networks and blockchains to transform traditional financial products into trustless and transparent protocols that work without intermediaries.

Currently, almost all DeFi applications are built on the Ethereum blockchain and Binance Smart Chain (EDIT: Binance Smart Chain is NOT as decentralized as Ethereum and is therefore often labeled as CeDeFi). Like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Binance have a blockchain that acts as a shared ledger in which digital value is tracked. Rather than a central authority, the participants making up the network control the issuance of ether (or BNB), the network's cryptocurrency, in a decentralized way.

Developers can program applications that can create, store and manage digital assets, also known as tokens, on the blockchain. For this to work, smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) are written and built. The expiration of these contracts and agreements is automatically enforced if the blockchain receives the correct data. You can make complex, irreversible agreements without the need for an intermediary.

Anyone is able to create, adapt, mix, link or build on an existing DeFi product without permission. DeFi protocols are modular, so they can be stacked on top of each other to build an increasingly dense system of interacting parts.

# Wallets

You can download a wallet on a PC, tablet or telephone. With this you can store, send or receive Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Three related concepts determine whether someone has ownership of a certain wallet, these are your digital keys (also called public & private keys), your wallet address and your digital signature.

The most important aspect of a wallet are your digital keys, as they give you access to your wallet. It is important to know that these keys are not stored online on the blockchain but are instead stored independently within the digital wallet itself. Each key consists of both a public key and a private key.

Consider your public key the same as the bank account, which also consists of an address. Your public key works more or less the same. The pin code with which you subsequently gain access to this bank account is then referred to as your private key.

It is very important that you ALWAYS keep your private key to yourself. If someone else has the private key, he / she can send and steal all coins, so keep it safe. With the public key, people can only send coins, so that can't hurt.

Every wallet has a unique code, which we also call the wallet address, which consists of a random letter and number combination that is different for everyone. This address is in fact the name of your wallet and makes it possible for others to transfer cryptocurrencies to you.

Example of just any bitcoin address: 14J5Q7ageKhM3miKd94DX44Kf6b7ko4BZe

Some people assume that your public key is the same as your wallet address. This is not entirely true, but the two are mathematically related.

In order for you to start using DeFi platforms, a browser wallet is needed.

# Coins vs Tokens

A coin runs on its own blockchain, on its own system. It is therefore completely independent. A coin could be compared to a contemporary currency, such as the Dollar. Bitcoin is a coin and has been developed with the aim of serving as a digital payment method and store of value.

Then there are tokens. Tokens by definition do not run on their own blockchain, unlike a coin. They have been added to an already existing blockchain. Tokens can have the same functionality as a coin, although this is not common.

Tokens that are created on the Ethereum network are typically ERC-20 tokens. When we talk about ERC20, we mean the standard that is implemented in certain tokens. ERC20 stands for 'Ethereum Request for Comment 20'. The Binance Smart Chain uses a similar standard, which is the BEP-20 standard.

These standards contains numerous functions that allow any token that has implemented this set of functions to be traded. Examples of those functions are:

* Sending tokens.
* Request balance information from any address.
* List the number of available tokens.

# Layer 2 solutions

Because of high demand, the Ethereum network is getting overloaded. This resulted in very high transaction fees, making it to expensive for small investors to use it's dapps.

This is the main reason why many investors moved to the Binance Smart Chain, which has much lower fees, untill Ethereum 2.0 has been implemented, which is an update that will drastically lower the transaction fees for the network.

However, in order for the Binance Smart Chain to maintain such low transaction fees, it had to sacrifice it's decentralized properties. This resulted in that the Binance Smart Chain is much more centralized and less safe compared to Ethereum.

Fortunately, there are various projects working on Layer 2 solutions to improve both the scalability and speed of the Ethereum network. Layer 2 refers to a secondary framework, chain or protocol that is built on top of an existing blockchain system. By doing so, the mainchain can be unloaded and can solely focus on the safety of the network.

In the case of Ethereum, there are currently 2 sidechains that are pegged to it. These chains are the xDai chain and the Polygon chain. The latter of the sidechains is the most promising Layer 2 solution so far.

By bridging your assets from the Ethereum mainchain to the sidechains, you are able to interact with various dapps that work on these sidechains for almost an negligible amount transaction fees.

# Getting started

Now that you're aware of the fundamentals of DeFi, let's dive into how you can move your assets into the various DeFi protocols.

# Setting up your wallet

In order to move your assets from your wallet on the exchange that you're using to either the Ethereum network, Binance Smart Chain, or Sidechains, you will need a browser wallet that can interact with these DeFi protocols.

I'm currently using MetaMask, so I will use this browser wallet in this guide:

1. Go to the official MetaMask website in your browser ([https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/))
2. Press “Get Chrome extension”, “Chrome Firefox Opera” or “Get Brave Browser”. This of course depends on the browser you want to use at that time.
3. You will now be taken to a page where you can add the extension. With Chrome, for example, there is a button with: + ADD. TO CHROME. Click on the button.
4. A popup appears to confirm this
5. You will now see a MetaMask logo at the top right of the browser. Click this to set up MetaMask.
6. Accept the terms and conditions
7. Create and confirm a new password. Please remember this password.
8. You will now see 12 words. With these words you can always recover your wallet - in combination with the password. Write these words down and keep them safe. Preferably offline - just on paper.
9. Congratulations! You have now installed and configured a MetaMask extension. You can now use the buttons “Buy” and “Send” to buy or send Ether to your wallet. You can now also send Ethereum to the address under “Account 1”.

Your MetaMask wallet will be automatically connected to the Ethereum network. In order to connect your MetaMask to the Binance Smart Chain, Polygon or xDai, follow these steps:

1. Click on the network in the top right corner.
2. Go to settings.
3. Click ""Add network""

In order to setup your wallet for the Binance Smart Chain, enter the following parameters:

Network Name: Smart Chain

New RPC URL: [https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/](https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/)

ChainID: 56

Symbol: BNB

Block Explorer URL: [https://bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com/)

&#x200B;

In order to setup your wallet for the Polygon sidechain, enter the following parameters:

Network Name: Matic Mainnet

New RPC URL: [https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/](https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/)

ChainID: 137

Symbol: MATIC

Block Explorer URL: [https://explorer.matic.network/](https://explorer.matic.network/)

&#x200B;

In order to setup your wallet for the xDai sidechain, enter the following parameters:

Network Name: xDai

New RPC URL: [https://rpc.xdaichain.com/](https://rpc.xdaichain.com/)

Chain ID: 0x64

Symbol: xDai

Block Explorer URL: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet)

# Faucets

In order to be able to perform transactions on these chains, you need to have some of their coins/tokens in your wallet in order to pay for the transaction fees.

* In order to use Ethereum you need Ether
* In order to use Binance Smart Chain you need BNB
* In order to use xDai you need xDai
* In order to use Polygon you need Matic

Luckily you can get small amounts of the currencies for free from so called faucets.

A faucet is an app or a website that distributes small amounts of cryptocurrencies. They’re given the name “faucets'' because the rewards are small, just like small drops of water dripping from a leaky faucet.

However, in the case of crypto faucets, tiny amounts of free or earned cryptocurrency are sent to a user’s wallet. In order to get free crypto, users need to complete tasks as simple as viewing ads, watching product videos, completing quizzes, clicking links (be careful!) or completing a captcha.

You can use the following faucets to receive small amounts of crypto:

* xDai: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet)
* Matic: [https://matic.supply](https://matic.supply)

Unfortunately. I wasn't able to find any faucets for Ether or BNB.

# Sending crypto from the exchange to MetaMask

In order to receive send your assets to MetaMask wallet, you need to fill in the correct address. This is probably straight forward for most of you, but please make sure to quadruple check you're MetaMask wallet address before sending your tokens from the exchange to your address.

When you're sending tokens from Binance, it will ask if you want to send them as BEP20 or ERC20 tokens. Please choose the correct one! Sending BEP20 tokens to your Ethereum address can result in a loss or they end up in your Binance Smart Chain wallet.

# Bridging: An important step!

Please notice that you can't send your tokens directly from the exchange to sidechains such as xDai or Polygon! You need to send them first to the Ethereum network (as they are both sidechains pegged to the Ethereum blockchain). Once received, you can bridge them to xDai or Polygon by using the following links:

* [https://bridge.xdaichain.com/](https://bridge.xdaichain.com/)
* [https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/)

Keep in mind that for during the bridging, Ethereum transactions fees have to be paid. After the bridging, you play by the rules of the sidechain (which means cheap transactions).

# I can't find my tokens in my wallet!

If you can't find your tokens back in your wallet after sending them from the exchange, you can follow these steps:

* Check the transaction record, is the transaction completed?
* Make sure you look at the right network. Your MetaMask wallet might be connected to the Binance Smart Chain network, hence not showing your assets.
* Add the contract address of your token to the wallet. You can find the address of your token via [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/) (Ethereum) or [https://bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com/yieldfarms) (Binance Smart Chain). The token address can then be copied in to the MetaMask wallet by clicking on add custom token.

# Setting up your dashboard

To make things a bit more clear, I would advice you to use the DeFi dashboard [Zapper.fi](https://zapper.fi/). Zapper is an interesting platform that lets you quickly and easily deploy and manage your DeFi positions within a single interface. It is a DeFi portfolio management dashboard that helps you stay on top of your portfolio, liquidity pools, and liquidity mining positions.

Zapper supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, xDai and Polygon. In order to connect to the right network, you must first connect your MetaMask to the network you want zapper to connect to. By clicking in the top right corner of your MetaMask wallet you can connect to the network you want Zapper to manage for you.

The first tab of Zapper, shows an overview of your account. It shows the value of your assets in your MetaMask wallet and how your deployed assets are performing in the DeFi protocols (if you deployed any already).

In order to reduce gas fees, Zapper has several features that can ""Zap"" your assets fast and ""cheap"" in order to:

* Start providing liquidity in a pool.
* Swap tokens.
* Bridge your tokens from one network to another.

Zapper also keeps track of the estimated APY's (Annual Percentage Yield) of the various pools from different DeFi protocols as well as farming opportunities.

# A list of DeFi protocols

Before wrapping this post up, I want to share the following website: [https://defipulse.com/](https://defipulse.com/)

DeFi Pulse records the top performing DeFi protocols on the Ethereum main chain as well as their TVL (total locked value) and ranks them accordingly. This page is really worth checking out as it can help you to pick the right protocols to deploy your assets in.

In order to monitor the DeFi space of Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and xDai I like to use [https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/defi](https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/defi) and [https://defiprime.com/#defi\_projects](https://defiprime.com/#defi_projects). However, If you use other resources in order to find the right dapp, let me know!

# That's it for this guide!

I really do hope that this guide helps you to get started on your DeFi adventure.If I missed something or whatever let me know so I can change it.

&#x200B;

* If you found this guide helpful, [please read my DeFi (Decentralized Finance) series](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mdjsrj/defi_explained_defi_wallets/). I've covered a wide plethora of subjects and linked all posts to make it more convenient for you to read.

EDIT 1: All right, there’s some confusion here whether Binance Smart Chain is decentralized or not. It’s NOT decentralized. The Binance Smart Chain is a fork of the Ethereum blockchain that sacrificed it’s safety and decentralized aspect in order to maintain low transaction fees and higher scalability!

EDIT 2: As pointed out by some comments, this post doesn't explain WHY you want to use DeFi. Unknown to many, this guide is part of a long series of posts, called ""DeFi Explained"". If you're interested in why you should-/want to- use DeFi, the following posts will be useful for you:

BNB,cryptocurrency,Proof that Binance manipulates CoinMarketCap data to keep themselves at the top,"There was another post claiming that since Binance owns CoinMarketCap, they manipulate their ""Exchange Score"" to keep themselves at the top of the list, so I decided to look into it. In comes [archive.org](https://archive.org)! You can view all of the snapshots available of the CMC exchange page here: [https://web.archive.org/web/20200715000000\*/https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/](https://web.archive.org/web/20200715000000*/https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/)

&#x200B;

Binance bought CMC in April of 2020. Through April, CMC ranked their exchanges based on volume. You can see from [this snapshot taken in April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200411021938/https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) that Binance ranked #16 based on volume. You can look at previous months and Binance fluctuates around various spots in the top 20.

&#x200B;

In May, about 1 month after Binance bought CMC, CMC began to rank exchanges by something they called ""Web Traffic Factor"". [From when they implemented this ranking in May](https://web.archive.org/web/20200520015928/https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) until they changed it in December, Binance stayed at the top of the list with a perfect score of 1000. Other exchanges scores fluctuated often, but Binance always had a perfect 1000 for 7 straight months.

&#x200B;

In December, CMC removed ""Web Traffic Factor"" in favor of something they call ""Exchange Score"". [Binance once again was ranked at the top with a 9.8](https://web.archive.org/web/20201224014406/https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/). Since then, Binance has stayed at the top with a 9.8 every month, while most other major exchanges have slowly had their ""Exchange Score"" lowered, or have at least had their score fluctuate month to month. No exchange has had a score that comes close to Binance's 9.8.

&#x200B;

It also appears that Binance is manipulating their volume on CoinMarketCap. Comparing CMC with CoinGecko, on October 3, 2020, [CoinMarketCap](https://web.archive.org/web/20201003150227/https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) reported a volume of $3.7 billion for Binance, while [CoinGecko](https://web.archive.org/web/20201003014608/https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges#) reported a volume of $2.7 billion. On November 12, 2020 [CoinMarketCap](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112040822/https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) reported a volume of $11.8 billion for Binance, while [CoinGecko](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112021659/https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges) reported only $4.1 billion.

&#x200B;

You can view all the snapshots for CMC available here and verify this yourselves: [https://web.archive.org/web/20200715000000\*/https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/](https://web.archive.org/web/20200715000000*/https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/).

&#x200B;

TLDR: Based on this data, I think it's clear that since Binance bought CMC, they have manipulated their data to keep themselves at the top of the list of exchanges. Makes you wonder what else they are manipulating, or will manipulate in the future, with their monopoly on the crypto market.",372,2021-03-17 16:06:41,102
BNB,cryptocurrency,Finally did it: I made a crypto trading bot that automatically places orders on new listings before they get added on Binance or Kucoin,"So I've been working on this project for over 6 months now, and I've learned quite a bit about how new listings behave, and how important the Binance and Kucoin Annoucement pages are.

My initial idea was to create a crypto trading bot in Python, that constantly checks if a new listing is added on Binance, essentially by checking the total number of coins at any given time. I tried out different variations on this, end even increased the speed to buy within 0.1 seconds on a new coin being listed.

After looking at the results, and talking to some of you on here, it turns out that the spike in the price upon listing the coin is actually the peak of the iceberg.

The real activity seems to happen once big exchanges announce that they will list the coin, and not upon the listing itself.

Have a look at the chart for FIDA/USDT below, and the time Binance made the announcement:

[FIDAUSDT](https://preview.redd.it/i42z3i9dxa981.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3bacc1b823f19c9c4f447e31678ebd6c639c648)

Looks like people are fomoing hard into new coins on different exchanges in anticipation of a Binance pump, ironically creating the pump themselves.

So with that in mind, I built a crypto trading algorithm that listens to the Binance announcement page, and once there is an announcement for a new coin listing, the bot extracts the symbol of that coin and places a Buy order on Gate .io.

The tool will automatically place buy and sell orders and it has a trailing stop loss feature, meaning that it should sell at the optimum time, in theory.

I chose gate .io because according to what I've seen and what some of you have said, this exchange seem to list many of the coins that later make it on Binance or other bigger exchanges.

The tool is free to use for everyone, but I suggest running it in Test mode at first, as I still need to confirm that everything runs fine. Annoyingly, gate .io doesn't have a testnet which means I had to test the buy/sell logic by placing real trades - not ideal.

But I've included a test mode for the tool itself, so it won't actually call the gate .io API, it will just simulate the trades locally.

The tool has been tested by me along with a bunch of other people for a while now. I can say that it definitely has potential, and has made profit on numerous occasions, however it is not perfect. Or rather - it can be improved further.

One of the issues we've been having is the speed at which the bot will buy the announcement. As you might expect, this needs to happen really fast in order to take advantage of the pump (under 5 seconds in most cases).

It seems that the speed of the bot varies from one listing to another, making consistent profits a bit tricky - but not impossible.

BNB,cryptocurrency,This is the bullrun and your favorite projects are cooked,"The s&p500 is breaking ATHs, BTC hit a new ath this year and is consolidating right bellow waiting to make its move passed it again.

You're all in denial about alt season repeating like in former cycles. I see it everyday with people buying up shitcoins and everyone in those ""communities"" claiming they're all going to go 4x their previous ATH ""once the bullbrun starts.""

News flash. This is the bullrun. Previously, people would take BTC profits and pump up larger cap alts, take those profits and go to small caps and finally micro caps. More people are holding onto their BTC. Look at the charts, theres far fewer flash crashes. All metrics suggest this including BTC in cold storage and more inactive wallets than ever. This BTC progression in previous cycles saw the alt coin market going nuts. At this point, You could do a 4x on any random binance pair. The fomo was crazy. There's none of that now. Just bleeding alts to BTC.

Furthermore, people are skipping out on the larger cap speculation for the meme coin defi market. Raydium is seeing all the volume that traditionally went to CEX listed alts.

""But meme coins are stupid and serve no purpose, I only buy ""serious"" projects.

News flash. The alt coin you've been holding for 5 years is just as useless as ElonBadgerCoq on trader Joe's. It's done nothing. The team has accomplished nothing. You know this and still try to justify your investment so you can separate yourself from the degen gamblers buying cat tokens on some DEX. I don't care how many transactions it can do or the speed of finality or what company is rumored to have plans to use it. Its the same meme coin hype shit, just a smaller scale.

Yes, some projects will pump in the next year. Yes, some projects are genuinely good with great developers making amazing tech. But most of the alts you're buying and holding with the expectation of past price action will not return to ATHs. Price aside, whatever goals on your teams roadmap mean fuck all. There's not that many problems a speculative token fueled blockchain can fix that some traditional network can't do better, faster and cheaper. No major publicly sold company cares about how decentralized something is.

Downvote me all you want. I know you really care about whatever ETH killer youve been stacking and holding. Some of you will get lucky and I hope you do. But for most, its not happening.

The reason why meme coins are so popular is because it's the streamlined, super fast paced version of the entire crypto market. It's the final format. A launch, a bunch of hype, the coin bleeds out, some people make some money, most lose. The coin drops close to 0 with all the bag holders claiming it will return to where it was.

What the FUCK.,"[CoinTelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sbf-tried-to-destabilize-crypto-market-to-save-ftx-report) published an article about CZ confronting SBF in a Signal group chat. The messages occurred on November 10, which is the night FTX went to hell.

CZ reportedly told SBF to 'stop trying to depeg stablecoins'. The stablecoin in question was Tether. CZ accused Alameda Research (FTX's hedge fund) of trying to destablize USDT with a $250k trade (such a weak amount lol). 

And according to the [New York Times,](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/09/technology/ftx-text-messages.html) SBF met with a high-level corporate Tether official in the Bahamas before he struck a deal with Binance. The objective of that conversation was to ask for billions in funding to save FTX.

BNB,cryptocurrency,A collection of all the possible ways to earn free Crypto,"The following list contains every possible way I know to earn some actual, free cryptocurrencies. I avoided shady websites, apps that I didn't try personally, and those services that make you download shitty games and malwares. This list contains only trusted services, without any referral codes.

If you think I missed something, please share it in the comments so that people can check that out as well!

&#x200B;

**Coinbase Earn** **\[about $30 in different cryptocurrencies\]:**

This is one of the most popular ways, although it is not really the quickest. You need a Coinbase account and to complete verification (so photo + document). Once you are verified, you will be put on a waiting list that usually lasts a couple of days. 

Once you get accepted, all you have to do is watch a video explaining how a project works, and answer some questions about it. It is not anything hard and you can find the answers online.

Right now, you can earn XLM, COMP, CGLD, GRT, NU, but they often update it with a new project so definitely keep the account once verified.

[LINK](https://www.coinbase.com/earn)

&#x200B;

**CoinMarketCap Earn** **\[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Basically the same as Coinbase Earn, but hosted by CoinMarketCap. For this, you'll need a CoinMarketCap account (just needs e-mail and password) and a verified Binance account (which requires verification, but there's no waiting list once verified). 

The payouts are slower than Coinbase Earn, since they are distributed after weeks and not immediately.

[LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/)

&#x200B;

**Faucets \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

This is one of the easiest and most immediate ways to get a small amount of crypto. You just need a wallet that can hold the coin and the relative address, and you're good to go.

They're basically websites that distribute small amounts of cryptos to the users asking for it, and they're supported by donations/ads and stuff like that.

There are a lot and you can often find them just by searching on Google ""<name of the coin> + faucet"".

A [good read](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-crypto-faucet) about them and some examples: [freenanofaucet](https://www.freenanofaucet.com/) and [Doge Faucet](https://www.dogefaucet.com/en)

&#x200B;

**Airdrops \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

An airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. 

They can be free or they might require holding certain tokens or doing small tasks.

Airdrops happen on many different platforms and for many different coins, so it's often hard to find them if you aren't familiar with the community or the platform. Anyway, [Airdrops.io](https://Airdrops.io) is a good website that gathers the best airdrops happening.

&#x200B;

**Bounties \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

In the crypto world, it is a marketing strategy where an ICO allocates a percentage of their tokens for “bounties”. These are tasks that are open to the public to complete and their reward is the new token that is launching. Once the token is launched, participants of the bounty will receive their tokens. 

As you may have noticed, they're similar to airdrops. As airdrops, it is often difficult to find them. [This](https://beta.bounty0x.io/explore) is a good website that gathers some bounties that are currently active.

&#x200B;

**WeNano \[NANO\]:**

This is one of my favorites, so I encourage you to check them out since the project is awesome.

Have you ever played Pokémon Go? Well, this is a similar app, but instead of capturing Pokémon, spots are created by users around the world, and by visiting them you can earn NANO and chat with other users. The payouts are actually really good, especially in large cities, and the community around it is awesome.

[This](https://www.wenano.net/) is the official website (it's available both for Android and iOS)

&#x200B;

**NanoQuakeJs \[NANO\]:**

Another favorite of mine. It's literally just Quake 3, on your browser, and for each kill you get some NANO. I challenge you to find something cooler.

[This](https://nanoquakejs.com/) is the website, you just need a nickname and a NANO address and you're good to go!

There are some other similar projects, one of which is [PlayerKillers](http://playerkillers.exchange/), but I mean, Quake is Quake.

&#x200B;

**Reddit \[MOON, DOGE, NANO\]:**

Yeah, Reddit. There are actually a couple of ways to earn crypto on Reddit.

First, our favorite, MOONs. You just need to set up your vault (on the app) and you're ready to receive moons next distribution! They happen once a month, and a fixed amount of moons are distributed to the r/CryptoCurrency community, based on the Karma you gained that month. So start shitposting!

Other subreddits, like Dogecoin's and Nano's have bots that allow you to tip users, so if you make a good submission there you'll probably receive some coins from kind redditors. 

Also, subs like r/dogecoinbeg exist, where you can... Well... Beg for dogecoins.

&#x200B;

**Publish0x \[ETH\]:**

This is a really cool project that I personally love. It is basically a website like Medium, where users can post blog entries.

The best thing about this is that the website provides the coins. You will literally earn crypto just by reading content on the website (which is crypto-related), sharing content and writing it (although you'll need to apply as an author to do so).

[LINK](https://www.publish0x.com/)

&#x200B;

**SteemIt \[STEEM\]:**

Steemit is a blogging and social media platform that uses blockchain technology and a cryptocurrency to reward its users for creating content, commenting, and upvoting other posts.  

It is really similar to Reddit, [here](https://steemit.com/)'s the link

[Cent](https://beta.cent.co/~discover/) is another similar social network built on top of Ethereum, worth checking out.

&#x200B;

**NFT marketplaces \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Many websites offer the possibility to sell artworks, collectibles and in general NFTs. NFT, for the newcomers, stands for Non-Fungible Token, and means a token representing something unique. 

You can think of it as an art piece: although you can copy it, scan it and print it, there will only be one original copy. NFTs are used to verify and confirm the uniqueness of something and its ownership. So, let's say I make a beautiful digital painting, I can ""link"" it to this token and whoever owns the token, owns the digital painting and can therefore sell it or trade it.

[KnownOrigin](https://knownorigin.io/), [Mintable](https://mintable.app/), [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) are all great example of such marketplaces. If you're a creative person and want to sell some of your works, those are great places to do so. 

&#x200B;

**Games and Collectibles \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Many games run on a blockchain, using NFTs to create unique and rare in-game assets. Think of a card game like HeartStone: on the blockchain, it is possible to create only 10 cards of a specific type (using NFTs), so only 10 users in the world can own that card, so that card would extremely rare and therefore valuable.

Usually, it is not easy to earn crypto this way, you'll need to play a bit before getting some good stuff that you can sell, but if you find a game that you like you can surely earn while having fun!

Examples of games are [MyCryptoHeroes](https://www.mycryptoheroes.net/home), [EverDragons](https://everdragons.com/), [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) and [Brave Frontier Heroes](https://bravefrontierheroes.com/).

Some aren't even games at all, just collectibles that you can buy, trade and earn. Examples are [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/catalogue) and [Clovers](https://clovers.network/)

&#x200B;

Endnote: especially services using NFTs on top of Ethereum are, right now, subject to really high fees that make it often impossible to trade these tokens effectively. Be careful when doing a transaction.

&#x200B;
&#x200B;

EDIT:
Some I forgot or didn't know about:

* **Brave browser**: allows you to earn BAT just by browsing and seeing ads. Both on PC and mobile.
* **ethtrader and fortniteBR**: they're also subreddits with a governance tokens (like moons), so you can earn some money shitposting there too.",5269,2021-02-17 16:44:23,1011

BNB,cryptocurrency,PSA: Binance recently increased ADA withdrawal fees by 400% and are lying about why they did it,"FINAL EDIT: it's back to 1 ADA 😄

Withdrawing ADA on Binance, until 2 days ago, would ""only"" cost 1 ADA.

They increased it to 3 ADA yesterday, and some time between yesterday and today they increased it further to 5 ADA.

That's a 400% increase in less than 48h. For comparison, transaction fees on Cardano are only 0.17 ADA.

And yet, after a user from r/cardano enquired about this issue, Binance claimed that the 5 ADA fee ""depends on the blockchain and miners"" (Miners on Cardano? Am I missing something?).

Proof: https://ibb.co/5k0MMpq

EDIT: proof of higher fees https://ibb.co/b6X5zh3

This is disgusting.

They're promoting their BNB coin boasting about their low fees, making other coins like ADA look like much less appealing alternatives.

For the sake of the free market, and to prevent Binance to pull off any more shady stuff á la Robinhood, please consider complaining to Binance about this.

Not cool Binance. Not cool.

EDIT: at the time of writing, the fee is down to 2 ADA (I'm based in UK if it matters). They keep changing it, fuck knows why",5369,2021-02-10 20:40:19,895

BNB,cryptocurrency,Most of this Binance FUD is baseless and silly. Everyone should always self custody bitcoin or any coins they're not trading with but don't be naive that there aren't people with ill intentions right now,"Some personal observations and trying to establish some facts around Binance FUD, a lot of which is deliberately misleading either due to not being well informed or malice. SBF's official paid spokesperson Kevin O'Leary seems to be behind most of it.

24 hours before SBF arrest, [the Block and Wall Street Journal](https://nitter.it/krugermacro/status/1602478325024391170) rehashed an old 2018 investigation into Binance out of the blue at the exact same time. Reuters then ran with it too but at least made sure to clarify the investigation is from 2018 and nothing new.

The investigation concerns Iranian firms using Binance. Kraken was also accused of it recently. Just last month, Binance's compliance team [froze Iranian assets](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2022/11/05/Binance-says-crypto-moved-through-platform-from-bad-actors-in-Iran-) and blocked concerned accounts for violation of US sanctions. These restrictions around US sanctions only apply to Binance US.

Few days ago, an article was shared here from CNBC titled 'Binance suspended withdrawals for USDC', but the article didn't at all mention that Binance autoconverts all USDC to BUSD since September. There was also a scheduled maintenance which Binance already notified users of over a week ago. Publications without ulterior motives can also be misleading if journalists aren't responsible enough to research thoroughly what they're writing about.

Again in a [CNBC interview yesterday](https://youtu.be/uwsJm3qgp9I), the hosts brought it up not knowing how stablecoins work. Mainstream journalists don't seem to know that unlike legacy fractional reserve system, assets are required to be backed 1:1 by crypto exchanges and there are no bailouts in bitcoin. After writing puff pieces, coddling SBF and destroying their reputations, they're now blindly assuming every exchange is like FTX blowing away customer funds.

The swap functionality from BUSD to USDC requires banking hours. Every properly managed stablecoin has its reserves in the legacy system in tradfi instruments dependent on legacy rails which is only operational 9 to 5 on business days. Since Binance autoconverts to BUSD and still allows USDC withdrawals, redeeming BUSD back to cash and then minting USDC needs legacy rails. USDC withdrawals got restored as soon as banks opened.

It would be easier for Binance not to support competitor's stablecoin USDC at all. You can't withdraw BUSD on Coinbase. Nobody asks why. Coinbase is even trying to push people away from USDT to its own stablecoin USDC. At least so far in the stablecoin wars, Binance has been the least anti-competitive out of the 3 major stablecoins.

The CNBC hosts then brought up something Kevin O'Leary said in congress. Kevin O'Leary lied that FTX buying out Binance's stake in the company 2 years ago is what made FTX become insolvent and said he wants a Madoff clawback. This clown is basically saying FTX was insolvent for 2 years and he invested and took money to promote an already insolvent company.

First of all, why the fuck was the official paid spokesperson for SBF allowed to testify? There's a clear conflict of interest. Binance invested in FTX back in 2019 and cashed out 2 years ago which it had every right to do. How is it relevant to FTX collapse?

FTX raised billions in several funding rounds since then, invested in big banner promotions and siphoned off customer funds to personal accounts. Binance was also paid mostly in FTX air tokens and was holding it all without selling until Alameda insolvency was exposed by Coindesk. After learning about Alameda insolvency, Binance announced it would liquidate those tokens over a period of few months but FTX collapsed the next day. Binance is still holding those FTT tokens and got rekt like everyone else.

When the CNBC hosts asked about this Madoff clawback Kevin O'Leary asked for, CZ said Binance's lawyers will deal with something like that. Some trolls on twitter edited the interview clip to look like CZ gave this response relating to users withdrawals.

Btw how about Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen, Shaq, Larry David, Biden, Warren, Maxine, all the celebrities, politicians and big shot funds return every single dollar as well? I'm all for it! For some reason, Kevin O'Leary specifically wants Binance to return a payment from 2 years ago rightfully owed to Binance by FTX.

Kevin O'Leary also lied in congress that CZ's tweet bankrupted FTX. According to Bahamian court records, it was ex co-CEO of FTX Ryan Salame who [blew the whistle](https://pacer-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/33/188450/042120682086.pdf) on FTX fraud and Alameda insolvency long before Coindesk expose article and CZ's tweet.

There's literally verifiable records of where it all went. It went to Alameda, SBF's personal accounts, to his parents, various properties, political donations and the rest of it was just massively overmarked FTT, SRM illiquid air tokens on Alameda's balance sheet. But Kevin still decides to defend SBF and blame Binance for FTX collapse while sticking up for all this fraud.

What dirt does SBF have on Kevin O'Leary that Kevin does not want people to know to keep defending a guy who clearly stole all customers' money? He's blaming a tweet for bankrupting a company which was already exposed to be insolvent. How can a tweet bankrupt a company? If ex co-CEO Ryan Salame had not blown the whistle, FTX would have sold billions more worth of paper bitcoin and stole all that money. SBF pledged to donate $1 billion to Biden's 2024 campaign. Where do you think that was going to come from?

Kudos to Joe Kernan for [calling out](https://nitter.it/GRDecter/status/1600858962555179010) this disgraceful piece of shit for lying and playing victim. Kevin O'Leary should be investigated as to why he keeps defending SBF saying that he did nothing wrong, what due diligence he did on FTX before becoming an official spokesperson and what knowledge he had as an official spokesperson about what was going on at FTX?

Another question the CNBC hosts asked was regarding big four audits for crypto firms. Enron was a big four audited public company (it was big five at the time). All the 2008 frauds had big four audits. Celsius had a $750 million funding round in December 2021 in which the lead investor brought in big four auditor Deloitte to do ""IPO level diligence"". [Here](https://nitter.it/jdorman81/status/1603538603824422912) is a CFA talking about legacy auditors still learning how to properly audit crypto firms.

[Big four audit firms keep failing. Now they’re being forced to change](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/06/business/uk-big-4-accountancy-firms-frc/index.html)

[The Wirecard Scandal - Hundreds of Wirecard employees lost their jobs, investors lost a total of €4.5 billion. Why didn't big four auditors recognize the fraud?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_0XEIFGK5o)

[KPMG – How a Big Four auditing firm went rogue in its greed for profit](https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-09-16-kpmg-how-a-big-four-auditing-firm-went-rogue-in-its-greed-for-profit/)

I think it would be more reliable than any big four audit to have a rigorous proof of reserves standard established that anyone can easily verify everything on chain. It would take a lot of work to establish a uniform industry standard but that is definitely the way forward. Legacy audits are obsolete for bitcoin and big four is just a grift. Bitcoin is self auditable by anyone and so should be all businesses involved in bitcoin.

Binance has over $60 billion in identified cold wallets and $13 billion flows were processed in a single day during an irrational FUD storm without a hitch. There are many reasons to criticize Binance. I have criticisms myself and shared one of them [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/y74xc8/ama_binancecom_product_team_here_ask_us_anything/isu7suz/), but the fact is no other exchange could handle these flows.

Exchanges should never be used for holding coins. Learn to self custody and better yet, learn to use P2P exchanges like Bisq, Robosats and HodlHodl. It's a small learning curve but once you learn you'll never need centralized exchanges anymore.

But Binance is not FTX. With FTX, there were not even identifiable cold wallets. FTX was outspending Binance, a much larger exchange on lavish marketing and partnerships, sold billions worth of paper bitcoin. Alameda was liquidating even sub $1 million positions on yield farms to backstop bitcoin withdrawals because it had zero reserves. Binance has shit to be called out on like every exchange but liquidity is not one of them.

BNB,cryptocurrency,"Reuters Investigate has found that in the last five years, Binance served as a middleman for the laundering of at least $2.35 billion from hacks, investments frauds and illegal drug sales","An inquiry into the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, financial activities by Reuters, reveals that the exchange platform has aided in laundering no less than $2.35 billion in corrupt funds, over a five year period. In a recurring pattern, as published by Reuters investigation report, Binance has helped launder money originating from scams, hacks, investment frauds, illegal drug sales, a foreign exchange violation case among others in the last five years. 

The U.S.  government also hired crypto researcher Chainalysis,  to monitor illegal flows, and it was reported that Binance received criminal funds totaling $770 million in 2019 alone, another report by Crystal Blockchain,  showed that a Russian-language site called Hydra, used Binance to make and receive crypto payments worth $780 million.  

Reuters calculated from an examination of court records, statements by law enforcement and blockchain data, compiled for the news agency by two blockchain analysis firms. Two industry experts reviewed the calculation and agreed with the estimate.

Binance declined to make Zhao available for an interview. Responding to written questions, Chief Communications Officer Patrick Hillmann said Binance did not consider Reuters’ calculation to be accurate. **He did not respond to requests to provide Binance’s own figures for the cases identified in this article.** He said Binance was building “the most sophisticated cyber forensics team on the planet” and was seeking to “further improve our ability to detect illegal crypto activity on our platform.” 

What impact do you think this will have on Binance and its' Binance Coin?

**#10 - XMR - $179.76**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, while this would be a great chart for pretty much any stock, and Monero had pretty decent gains this month, it's still the black sheep of the challenge. Strange to say that when it's gone up almost 400% in the last 6 months, but that's pretty sleepy in the current Crypto market. Maybe Monero is predicting a bear market to come.

&#x200B;

**#9 - XRP - $301.67**

&#x200B;

[Hills and valleys.](https://preview.redd.it/bub5pa5pu8x61.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a917cbb57f25fd62fa56ca12a504af0fd219835)

&#x200B;

Again, this doesn't look like a bad chart, right? XRP more than doubled to start the month, retraced when Bitcoin fell, and leveled off. It's actually double what it was last month, and up 6x overall! Unfortunately, that's pretty bad here.

&#x200B;

**#8 - IOTA - $391.66**

&#x200B;

[Bumpy paths on the tangle.](https://preview.redd.it/ba8gd415v8x61.png?width=533&format=png&auto=webp&s=0267a5d84c5ab33e349dfde53ba26de48198ce65)

Like a lot of coins this month, IOTA rocketed up and almost doubled to start it, then cratered with Bitcoin and leveled off. It's up a little bit from last month, but nothing special.

&#x200B;

**#7 - ETH - $395**

&#x200B;

[You don't see charts much nicer than this, folks.](https://preview.redd.it/s8p7otckv8x61.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e40046c0b92a7aa772330817ba07ac62a605c7d)

Oh baby, what a month for ETH. It's basically a straight ride up into the stratosphere, with ETH hitting multiple all time highs all the way up. It barely noticed as Bitcoin went down 25% and then soared into the distance. Funny thing is, despite this amazing monthly chart, ETH still sits near the bottom of this challenge. 8x gains just aren't good enough here, I guess.

&#x200B;

**#6 - LTO - $418.55**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[The pride before the fall.](https://preview.redd.it/uxrax8f0w8x61.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f958910229bf24edd4694a6b28bb3d2c375d965)

Not the prettiest chart. LTO fans were rewarded with a brief $0.90 all time high before an awful 55% drop in value. A big rebound pushed it back up, only to level off somewhere in the middle. One of the first coins to see a significant monthly downgrade in the challenge, the other one was XRP during the original stages of the lawsuit.

&#x200B;

**#5 - NANO - $637.05**

&#x200B;

[Recovery, or anomaly?](https://preview.redd.it/vsgbe56lw8x61.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=d06ef7cac55650bf772cf06dce6feb1769469451)

&#x200B;

NANO spent most of April plagued by a spam attack upon the network - Exchanges couldn't trade it, people couldn't use it. It remained flat volumewise until hope of a fix on the horizon came, then shot up, basically doubling in price overnight. Since then, it's gone the way of other coins in retracing. Still, it's up a great amount on the month!

&#x200B;

**#4 - ADA - $663.85**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Bet you can't tell the difference between this and Bitcoin.](https://preview.redd.it/jxg8m84ax8x61.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=115f067ef61e4224573c317f1c72e601edeaf67f)

ADA largely followed Bitcoin to the letter this month, rising with the highs, falling with the lows, and leveling out almost exactly to what Bitcoin did. It even ended up slightly higher than last month exactly the same as Bitcoin did.

&#x200B;

**#3 - VET - $927.46**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Strong sentiment creates mountains.](https://preview.redd.it/k0wmt7inx8x61.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dc40fd14ee85ccdf0aac0172156932ca23dab6e)

In a particularly strong month, VET almost tripled even during the decline of Bitcoin, obliterating all time highs until finally leveling off on a more realistic level. Still up double on the month though, so fans of the project have good reason to smile at the level it's stayed at.

&#x200B;

**#2 - SOL - $1176.97**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Hard to get much better looking charts than this.](https://preview.redd.it/mkn2lld4y8x61.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=c605876c6ae6a4bf844283b9421bf73bb2df9a60)

SOL doubled this month, which seems like a pretty damn good month, until you realize that it's been **doubling almost every single month.** Not even joking here. SOL started the project at $2 and is now solidly over $40, that's crazy.  That's **over 20x gains in 6 months.**  Which of course, makes you wonder why it's at #2. Well, this leads us to, of course..

&#x200B;

**#1 - DOGE - $14,461.34**

&#x200B;

Alright, so, I think we've hit peak Shibe.  Not really much to say about this chart other than it's utterly ribonkulous. Let's be real here. It's gone up over 10x.

This month.

It's up almost 300x since the beginning of the challenge. 6 months ago.

Our portfolio ended last month at $$4,694.02, giving a total gain of **$13859.30 in March.**

If the $500 (10,000 moons) had been left in moons, they would currently be worth $**$1400.**

If the $500 had been left in BTC (0.0353 \* $54,192), it would be worth $**1912.97**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Quite obviously, the portfolio has outperformed basically everything. It's not even remotely close. However, moons doubled over the last month, so they at least put up a bit of a fight.

I can cash you out of the challenge right now, and we can replace DOGE with the highest voted answer in this thread. I will put another $50 in moons in and people here can pick another one to fight with the pack.

If you don't choose to accept this one time deal, I will stick to the original terms of the challenge and distribute you the returns on November 5th.

Please let me know if you want to accept it. At almost $15,000 USD, the $50 spent in November can buy you a new car, or something else you'd enjoy in life. Think about it. :)

BNB,cryptocurrency,The ban of Privacy Coins on Binance highlights how dangerous centralized exchanges are,"As most of us have heard by now, binance has just stopped the trading of multiple privacy coins on its platform in several European countries.

While it may be true that they have been pressured to do so by governments, it serves as an important reminder as to how dangerous centralized exchanges are and how much we have to trust them.

Taking this situation, a large number of coins were forced to have trades halted due to government action. This shows us how much power governments really have over centralized exchanges. 
Tomorrow, they may choose to ban all crypto transactions. Or what if they decide to force CEXs to stop withdrawals. They probably won’t, however, the fact that they could is scary.

One important thing to remember is that decentralized exchanges do not have these flaws. Personally, I think that if this latest development serves to do anything, it is to remind us the benefits of decentralized exchanges, and perhaps encourage us to use them more.

Please do let me know if you have any arguments against this, I would be very interested to hear them",71,2023-06-01 03:26:44,68

BNB,cryptocurrency,"The Crypto Fear and Greed index is now at 12 (extreme fear). It has only dropped to this level five times in the past this cycle. So lets look at those dates, and look at the bitcoin price at that point and see whether each time presented a good buying opportunity.","For those you aren't aware, the Crypto Fear and Greed index uses 5-6 measurements to assess the current sentiment of the market and then rates that level of emotion on a scale of 1 to 100. 1 is extreme fear and 100 is extreme greed.

Those measurements are objective of course - they look at volatility, social media, momentum, dominance, google trends and (now paused) surveys.

Here is the link to the site, you can look at the chart, click ""max"" and you will see a movement of the index since the start of 2018.

[https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/)

In theory, the idea should be that in cases of extreme fear, the market is terrified and panic selling, and it is a good buying opportunity. When the market is in a state of extreme greed, people are getting extreme fomo and buying regardless of the elevated prices. Hopefully you get the picture.

There is a lot of movement in the chart but it is the extreme fear and greed regions that interest me - specifically around the region of 80 plus or 20 below.

Today the fear and greed index is at 12 - not a record low but very close and certain the lowest for a very long time. And yet the price is at $37,500 - still historically extremely high.

Looking at the index to date, there are only five other times in the past where the index has plunged below 20. I thought it would be helpful to look at that regions, what was happening and the price at that point, and to think of those as historical buying points:

**6 February 2018 - Index Score: 8. BTC Price $6,852.**

This is probably the point at which there was a realization we truly were in a bear market, with bitcoin already down around 65% since its top. While buying at this point (the start of a 1 year bear market) is not exactly enticing, that price was more or less the average price for most of the year. Certainly not a bad entry point if you had resisted the temptation to buy in the entire bull market of 2017.

**1 April 2018 - Index Score 16. BTC Price $6,975**

Around March of 2018 was a bit of a ""dead cat bounce"" with the price recovering to nearly $12,000. Many people breathed a sigh of relief, portfolios turned green and it seemed like the bear market was over. Nope. Bitcoin immediately crashed right back down again to prices similar to February. Hence a moment of extreme fear.

Again, this wasn't a particularly bad buying point historically, having just avoiding fomo of the surge in bitcoin up to that much higher price level.

**25 November 2018 - Index Score 9. BTC Price $3,895**

Now we're talking. This was the time of the infamous ""hash wars"" when BCH forked and the markets plunged into absolute chaos. Bitcoin crashed through its $6,000 support level and halved in price.

This was an absolute buying opportunity - perhaps the opportunity of a lifetime, with an average price around this level for six months. Happy to say I bought right through but not enough. Each buy at the time seemed painful, and it was embarassing at times for people to even know you were in crypto.

Also recall that at $3,100 very few people were calling this the bottom (shout out to Smart Contractor from twitter here who picked it). Many had buy ladders down to $1.3k, and it seemed a fall to at least the mid $2,000s was obvious. A little bit like those all calling for $25k right now.

**22 August 2019 - Index Score 5. BTC $10,124**

This one might feel like a bit of an anomaly, but in some ways it feels quite similar to today. Bitcoin had just ripped from $4k to around $14k and the bull run was on. After a short period, bitcoin fell sharply and the price started to collapse downwards. I think ""5"" is a bit extreme for fear but this was the realization that the bull market might be over. For the next six months, the bitcoin price let out steam down to $6.5k (aside from one day when President Xi managed to pump us back to $10,300 - oh for the days when China would actually pump our prices).

So not a great buying spot, but better than FOMOing at $14k and historically still not bad.

**13 March 2020 - Index Score 10. BTC $5,142**

I don't think this one needs much explanation. The corona effect was sharp and deadly, with the bitcoin price absolutely collapsing quickly. Again, I don't think we have any debate that this was one hell of a buying opportunity. Even more if you had cash to deploy in the weekend. One person I know bought ETH at $85 or so at that point. And there are some people suggesting the charts today are quite similar to this. Hmmmm.

**Today. Index Score 12. BTC $37,753**

What can we say? I think the terror here is real. But at the same time a billion dollars of stable coins just flooded into binance and bifinex, and funding rates have switched negative. If we look to the panic in November 2018, this was the start of a six month period of hell - worst case scenario we might get something like that, but also recall that in November the worst was already nearly over.

To be continued!

EDIT:  For those wondering what I am doing right now, not much.  My yield farms are running at full capacity - I'm still harvesting them and sending all the crypto to binance to buy BTC.  I'm keep doing that until we see a decent retrace or bitcoin dominance pump, and that I'll use the BTC to expand my farms.",3304,2021-05-22 23:16:33,776
BNB,cryptocurrency,Is this a big bull trap?,"Not gonna lie, my portfolio never looked so beautiful and I’m so glad that I DCAed the last two years in coins which I believe in. 

BUT, there was so much FUD going on before this big green candles started to pop up, like the Portfolio from FTX which will be liquidated in the next time (around 1 billion). 
Or Binance now being completely observed by the US government as the by far biggest crypto exchange and other exchanges going bankrupt. 

I just don’t see any news which would make sense for this bull run right now. My plan won’t change no matter what. It can go up like this or down again, I will DCA and hope it’s just the start. 

What do you guys think?",808,2023-12-06 11:33:29,959
BNB,cryptocurrency,"The top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence: the updated version","It's been 6 months since my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lg1yhv/for_the_newcomers_the_top_50_cryptocurrencies/) trying to sum up the biggest cryptos in a few words. I feel like an updated version is long due and so here we are.

As usual, if something is wrong or you would like to make a correction, feel free to comment. It's obviously hard to sum up each project in a few words, but I tried my best.

Terms used:

* If I refer to layer-2 solutions, that means a protocol or framework built on top of an existing blockchain and trying to increase transaction speed or scaling.
* [PoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work): Proof of Work
* [PoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake): Proof of Stake

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009 and since then it has become much more of a Store of Value than a currency, given its scarcity and high security, although layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network allows for fast and cheap transactions.
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** the coin of the Ethereum blockchain, the first smart contract platform and the one having the biggest ecosystem of decentralized applications around: since ETH price is used to pay fees to interact with the network, a bigger ecosystem means higher demand. It is (and will be) used for staking in Ethereum 2.0 (which is PoS).
3. **Tether (USDT):** the most discussed stablecoin around, pegged to the dollar price although many believe it is not fully backed: for this reason its market cap has been decreasing for the first time ever and other stablecoins are gaining traction.
4. **Binance Coin (BNB):** the official Binance coin and the one used to pay fees on the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain like Ethereum but less decentralized and with cheaper fees (not counting any layer 2 solutions).
5. **Cardano (ADA):** the coin of the PoS blockchain Cardano, created by the Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and developed strictly following peer-reviewed research, which slowed down development. Lots of partnerships and a big community make it one of the biggest ETH contenders.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** a centralized coin trying to redefine online payments, has had a rough time after the SEC went after it but seemingly it's coming out on top.
7. **USD Coin (USDC):** another stablecoin tied to the dollar and managed by the company Circle. Considered more trustworthy than Tether, it's been growing non-stop adoption-wise.
8. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** such wow, even higher ranking than last time. *sigh*
9. **Polkadot (DOT):** it's the coin of Polkadot, a multichain protocol aiming to connect different chains, both public and private, allowing to transfer data between one another or to create new custom blockchains. ChainLink's oracle pallet and Kusama are examples of projects built on top of it.
10. **Binance USD (BUSD):** another stablecoin pegged to the dollar, managed by Binance in partnership with Paxos.
11. **Uniswap (UNI):** the first token on the list, it's used to govern the decentralized trading protocol Uniswap, probably the biggest and most known DeFi application built on Ethereum.
12. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** a fork of Bitcoin trying to increase scalability and lower transaction fees increasing the blockchain block size, which achieves these features but reduces [decentralization](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f32dac47-a7a6-4e5d-af5b-28e4f1d87287).
13. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin younger brother, been around since 2011. It's based on the Bitcoin code but with some tweaks, lowering transaction speed and cost, many sees it as the ""silver"" of crypto since it's been around for so long.
14. **Chainlink (LINK):** between one Ganon and the other Link is also the official token of ChainLink, a network that basically bridges off-chain data with smart contracts: an example is Synthetix, a derivatives protocol that uses Chainlink to get the price feed of a certain asset on their smart contract.
15. **Solana (SOL):** one of the latest Ethereum contenders, launched in 2020 and offering possibly the highest layer-1 thoughput of all (50k transaction per second!), but is still somewhat centralized (although this is being addressed) and has yet to build a competitive ecosystem.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** it's a tokenized version of Bitcoin so it can be used on the Ethereum network and in DeFi applications.
17. **Polygon (MATIC):** the most popular layer-2 solution for Ethereum, Matic is the official coin of Polygon and used to pay fees on it: many Ethereum applications are moving there but it's still not easy to use with few exchanges supporting it directly.
18. **Ethereum Classic (ETC):** native token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain, a hard fork of Ethereum that claims to be more tied to Ethereum original plan. It has suffered various 51% attacks in the past years.
19. **Stellar (XLM):** created by an ex-Ripple founder, its aim is to become a currency and to allow to trade assets in a cheap and fast way. Last time I joked it was a 40c stablecoin, now I wished that held true.
20. **THETA (THETA):**  The token of THETA, a decentralized video delivery network (in a p2p fashion), used mainly for governance.
21. **DAI (DAI):** the biggest stablecoin not pegged 1-to-1 (or at least not claiming to) to the dollar, but soft-pegged and using cryptocurrencies deposited in smart contracts to collaterize the newly minted tokens.
22. **Internet Computer (ICP):** after its disastrous launch earlier this year, it almost overthrew Dogecoin as the biggest meme in the space. Jokes aside, it's a blockchain aiming to revolutionize the current internet, claiming to run at the same speed as the current web.
23. **VeChain (VET):**  Once everyone's favorite coin in this sub, was hit hard in the May crash and only lately recovering. Vechain is a blockchain focusing on business use-cases and supply chain management, VET (and VTHO) are the blockchain's official coins.
24. **Filecoin (FIL):**  the most popular IPFS (Interplentary File System), a peer-to-peer storage network without having to rely on cloud storage companies.
25. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron's founder Justin Sun is like Jian-Yang, great at repackaging other projects (thanks to u/fbslo on the last post). Jokes aside, it's a blockchain platform for decentralized applications more focused on content sharing and entertainment.
26. **Monero (XMR):**  Monero's goal is  to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, Monero obscures even senders and recipients whereas BTC doesn't. 
27. **Aave (AAVE):** a lending-borrowing decentralized protocol on Ethereum (and Polygon), the AAVE token grants discounted fees on the platform and act as a governance token.
28. **TERRA (LUNA):** Terra is a blockchain protocol offering a variety of applications, from stablecoins to synthetic assets and stocks. LUNA is the native token used to stabilize the price of UST (the TERRA stablecoin) and peg it to the dollar, and can be used to pay fees on the network.
29. **EOS (EOS):** another PoS blockchain launched in 2018, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It is designed to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology. 
30. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the native token of the Crypto.com chain and the Crypto.com exchange. Similar to the BNB token, it is closely tied to the success of the exchange.
31. **AMP (AMP):** it's an Ethereum token and it's used as collateral on the Flexa network, covering any financial transactions that fail if the need arises.
32. **Axie Infinity (AXS):** without a doubt the most popular blockchain game, a mix of Pokémon and Tamagotchi that follows the Play-To-Earn model. AXS is the token used for governance and soon staking.
33. **PancakeSwap (CAKE):** the most popular decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain, it started off as a copy of the Uniswap AMM model to then provide a variety of services.
34. **FTX Token (FTT):** the native token of the FTX platform, specialized in trading derivatives. It can be used as collateral or for discounts on trading fees.
35. **Bitcoin BEP2 (BTCB):** another tokenized version of Bitcoin, this time on the Binance Smart Chain.
36. **The Graph (GRT):**  It is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS like Filecoin. Basically simplyfing the retrieval of data on blockchains for developers and applications.
37. **Algorand (ALGO):** founded by the MIT professor Silvio Micali, it's a PoS blockchain supporting smart contracts, with low fees and high throughput of operations.
38. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):**  A utility token related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex. 
39. **Maker (MKR):** Maker is a token on the ethereum blockchain use for governance of the MakerDAO and Maker protocol, the organization behind the DAI stablecoin.
40. **Cosmos (ATOM):** dubbed the ""internet of blockchains"" by its founders, it solves the problem of interoperability between blockchains and provides tools to developers to build their own blockchains. Atom is the coin powering the platform and some notable projects built on top of it are Terra and Crypto.com chain.
41. **SHIBA INU (SHIB):** a meme coin that exploded in May, recently ShibaSwap was launched to give some sort of use-case to the coin which got a 3% score by DeFi Safety (later updated to 35%).
42. **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** a hard fork of a hard fork (BCH), it claims to be the true Satoshi Nakamoto vision of Bitcoin with an even bigger block size. Can't come up with a better joke than last time, I'm sorry.
43. **Tezos (XTZ):** another PoS Ethereum competitor. XTZ is the official coin used for governance and staking. One characteristic is that it is unforkable: it's impossible to create duplicates as instead happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum.
44. **Klaytn (KLAY):** a blockchain using a hybrid design between public and private chains, allowing anyone to create their own chain easily and without any technical knowledge, trying to appeal to companies and institutions mainly.
45. **NEO (NEO):**  *Noone can be told what it is, you'll have to see if for yourself.* Just kidding: launched in early 2014, it's a blockchain not too different from Ethereum where NEO is the coin used for governance. It has a Smart Economy System using digital assets (linked to a physical one) and verificable digital identities on smart contracts. 
46. **IOTA (MIOTA):**  open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things,  it uses a inventive blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same, with zero transactions fees and good scalability.
47. **Compound (COMP):** it's the governance token of Compound, a borrowing and lending platform not too different from Aave, launched in 2018 and with one of the biggest locked value of DeFi applications.
48. **TerraUSD (UST):** it's a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is available in different blockchains and it's getting more and more adoption, rising the price of Luna (which is directly tied to the demand for UST).
49. **Avalanche (AVAX):**  open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange. With an high throughput and good scalability, anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. 
50. **Theta Fuel (TFUEL):** it's another native token of the Theta blockchain, it acts as a gas token to power the operations on the blockchain and is used for payments to relayers (users sharing their computing power).

BNB,cryptocurrency,"The Great Moon Experiment: Finale - November 5th, 2021. 10,000 in Moons - $500 USD - 10 Coins on Binance, Redditors pick the Coins - Prize distribution!","Morning /r/cryptocurrency!

Today marks the finale of the 10,000 moon project.

&#x200B;

1 year ago today, [I made a post where posters here could pick coins](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/joj3q6/the_great_moon_experiment_beginning_today/) and I would hold them for a year - After the year, I would distribute the results to the people who got the 10 highest voted coins.

There's been plenty of ups and downs - The $50 into DOGE last november turned into $15,000 - [Which I asked the user if they wanted to sell and they did - Generously donating $5k to a nonprofit chosen by the community](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n9e8kz/009btc_charity_donation_help_choose_a_nonprofit/).

&#x200B;

Without further adieu, here are the final results (Apologies for the lack of blockfolio graph - Old tablet died):

&#x200B;

**ETH - 0.121 - $544.50**

&#x200B;

ETH has gained almost 11x from last November, not only following Bitcoin on the way up but having its own price discovery - Hitting multiple all time highs and making pretty much every fan of the project happy along the way. A $50 investment has turned into $544.50, and that's definitely better than your local bank!

&#x200B;

**NANO - 70.3 - $407.74**

&#x200B;

You know, it hasn't been the biggest year for NANO - There were some rises and some falls, but it mostly stuck with Bitcoin and did it's own thing. A fairly quiet year for the project led to it mostly staying on the same tracks - But that still ended up with 8x gains from the original investment. Not a bad trade!

&#x200B;

**ADA - 504 - $1,008**

&#x200B;

After a huge breakout year where holders saw 100x gains, ADA has regressed back just a little, but the vast majority of holders of the project must be super happy about where it is. With smart contracts finally released and the project looks pretty solid, ADA has enjoyed a blistering 20x gain from the original $50 input.

&#x200B;

**VET - 4,911 - $775.93**

&#x200B;

VET has had its ups and downs, rising to a huge all time high and then heading back down the ladder, only to find a bit of a resurgence as the year enters its end times. Overall, the project has looked pretty sold, with a 15x return from the start of the project.

&#x200B;

**XRP - 212 - $248.04**

&#x200B;

In a year bogged down with lawsuits and delistings, XRP wasn't the star performer of the crowd like it was in 2017 - It hit lows not seen for years before bouncing back up with Bitcoin and the possibility of a positive result in the lawsuit. Regardless, it still managed 500% returns from the beginning of the year, sitting about roughly even with Bitcoin itself. Could be worse!

&#x200B;

**IOTA - 204 - $277.44**

&#x200B;

Nothing special for the tangle this year either - Roughly moving with Bitcoin almost the entire way and not really having breakthroughs at any point of the year. Still, nothing wrong with that, you could've invested in government bonds instead of having 5x returns.

&#x200B;

**LTO - 734 - $213.81**

&#x200B;

LTO started the challenge off about as strong as could be - Rocketing to new all time highs every day, but has not kept up the rocket fuel needed to stay there. As a result, it's sat around roughly $0.30 since ""the good ol' days"" of the project. As such, 4x returns is all this project managed to hang onto - Which is not great for this project, but damn good overall!

&#x200B;

**SOL - 27 - $6,417.36**

Well, there's nothing more to be said here. SOL's initial $50 investment has ballooned into the current #4 crypto, with expectations sky high.  It's become a community favourite, and no wonder - SOL's returns from the beginning of the project are an almost unbelievable 128x.

&#x200B;

**XMR - 0.453 -117.07**

By far the worst performer of the entire challenge, almost from the start to the finish, XMR has remained one of the least profitable investments in the entire challenge. XMR underperformed Bitcoin, and the vast majority of other cryptos. Still, better than having your money in a bank with 0.05% interest!

&#x200B;

**XLM - 72 - $26.56**

&#x200B;

Ok, to be fair to XLM, this was swapped in the middle of the challenge at almost the top of the May cycle - When DOGE was sold, so it's not an entirely fair look to XLM - It's done relatively well over the year but was bought at almost the most unrealistic level possible. To make it fair, I will swap $25 more to make up a $50 investment for the person who suggested it.

&#x200B;

The last time the portfolio was tracked, it was at **$7608.46** giving us a net gain of of **$2427.99** from October to November.

If the $500 (10,000 moons) had been left in moons, they would currently be worth **$1739.16.**

If the $500 had been left in BTC (0.0353 \* $54,200), it would be worth $**2176.24.**

&#x200B;

It was a fun ride! The portfolio has outperformed pretty much everything, $500 has turned into over $25,000 to be distributed, and I'll ping the winners shortly so they can post their addresses for their christmas presents.

Thanks for playing everyone :)",59,2021-11-05 13:18:38,127
BNB,cryptocurrency,"Binance proof of reserves missing coins BCH, XMR","Binance proof of reserves page has BitcoinCash missing despite including lower marketcap coins. Ever since they accidentally leaked they didn't have enough BitcoinCash over a year ago, they have never published BitcoinCash data again.

The other coin that is missing is Monero. But I don't know if they ever showed it. The Monero community frequently talks about stopped withdrawals indicating they are out of real coins.

Makes sens imo since both coins are one of the most opposed coins. And likely the ones that get shorted the most. BitcoinCash just recently broke out of this trend while Monero hopefully does soon. In all the speculation craze these two coins, in my opinion, are the most important ones because they offer an alternative to the FIAT system.",28,2024-03-25 17:09:19,34
BNB,cryptocurrency,"Now that we're in a bear market, is anyone actually still using your blockchain?","I love metrics. So I am constantly analysing data to compare and validate my theories on which blockchains and projects will survive and demonstrate the most upside potential. One metric, I look at often is the daily active users. It's a great metric to tell whether the chain is being used.

**What are Daily Active Users?**

This is simply the number of addresses on the blockchain that perform at least one transaction on a particular day. If there are 1000 addresses sending transaction, then that implies 1000 people used the blockchain.

**Why is it important?**

A blockchain will be successful if people are using it. That is an obvious assertion. If lots of people are making transactions, then the project has inherent utility. If its being effectively used during a bear market, then *there is potential for great upside during a bull run*.

**Why compare to the November highs?**

During the peak of the bullrun, we saw enormous take up and investment in crypto. Millions of new users creating their accounts, interacting with the blockchain, experimenting with dApps etc. It was sometimes difficult to find the data for the exact date, so all results were taken on or close to 10 November 2021, as this was the date of Bitcoin's all time high.

By comparing the current daily users to that date, we can ascertain a decent perspective on which users decided to stick around, or perhaps even which projects are still attracting new users, despite the bear market.

**What data could be missing?**

An obvious hole is that this shows the blockchain data only. Any transactions made on exchanges will not be counted towards the daily active users.

Another possible gap in the data comes from the impact of bots. Many blockchains have bots performing automated tasks, and these appear the same as any other user.

The date I chose was base don the Bitcoin price, and likely doesn't perfectly coincide with the all time highest daily active users on any particular chain - that could of course occur any day.

**Examples:**

The following is an examples are for Polkadot and Avalanche. I checked the published statistics on the [Polkadot](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=account) and [Avalanche](https://stats.avax.network/dashboard/overview/) websites, and then compared them to data on Messari and/or Glassnode. This is the same thing I did to complete the table below.

&#x200B;

**Results**

I've prepared the table below based on the data. I've also included a column demonstrating the change in daily active users between November and now.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I will reserve judgement for now as to which projects show more or less potential for value increase based on their daily active users only. Suffice it to say, obviously for a project to become successful, adoption is key.

How does your project choice measure up? If you are concerned about your investments, check the numbers against several other sources. Messari would be another good place to start.

BNB,cryptocurrency,"PEPE is down 24% today and 70% from the time of the Binance listing.

&#x200B;

It is *rather interesting* how PEPE looks like a rugpull. I'm not saying it is, just commenting on the appearance.

But this is why you don't FOMO. All you end up being is exit liquidity. Everyone who got in early was simply waiting for an opportunity like this to dump on excited traders who FOMOed in. And all of a sudden, everyone who rushed to buy is suddenly down at least BIG. Even those who cut their losses early are down at least 10-15% because the price was dropping like a rock.

There were also apparently some sub users upset that the sub ""prevented"" them from participating in the big pump. You're quite free to do as you wish with whatever coin. This is just a showing, an practical example of what *could happen* if you do, or for some, *did*.",1245,2023-05-12 10:54:50,760

I am new to crypto and to be fair I’ve only had Binance tell me to go fuck myself because of American sanctions, but this is just messed up. We’ve been blocked out of Binance for 2 years and no one’s said shit, I doubt any of you even knew that we had to pack our shit up and leave, the Russians haven’t even been blocked yet and I’ve seen you people become united as if it were your own accounts.

“Binance owner says blocking innocent Russians accounts is unethical”

“We must stand up for all users”

Are we not innocent? What is it? Why are y’all more worried about the *idea* of it happening to Russians but we’ve been kicked out for years and no one batted an eye?

Fair enough, I can use other exchanges like KuCoin. 

This isn’t even a geographical issue, I’m in Dubai and binance is supported here, but everytime I try to verify my account I get blocked because my Dubai residency card shows where I’m from.

To the Russians, I’m not mad at you guys, you really shouldn’t be thrown off of exchanges because of your government. I guess I’m just pissy because people fight for you and leave us out in the sun. 🤷🏻‍♂️ 


Fuck the Government. Sanctions don’t affect the government, it affects ordinary, innocent people. The poor American government must think if they use sanctions, the Iranian government will stop being bad because they feel bad for their people suffering. What a joke.



Update: Thankyou for the support, I didn’t mean this to be hateful or mean. 

To the people rightly saying that sanctions are built to hurt ordinary citizens so that they step up and fight their government. You are right. That’s the whole point of it and Iranians are fighting back, they are protesting but unfortunately, the world is very different than the western democracy you’re used to. Some governments really don’t care how many people they kill. Some governments block all internet access so they can play Duck Hunt with people.

I tried posting a link but it isn’t working for some reason. Google Iranian protests and enjoy. 

I agree with you all, but this is getting too political and that is not safe.

All I’m saying is, the crypto exchange bosses shouldn’t sanction users. Allow people to trade freely.



Update: From the crazy amount of support I’ve seen, I understand race is not an issue in this and I apologize for bringing it up. I have taken it out. Please raise awareness. 

What you are afraid of happening has already happened, help stop that.",2341,2022-03-04 04:30:56,627

BNB,cryptocurrency,"What happened in the last bear market, as best as I can remember it.","So the recent price action is probably rekindling the PTSD of us 2017 gang, and I thought it would be fun to take a trip down memory lane and remind us all of the pain and terror of the 2018-2020 bear market, as best as I can recall it.  

#The Elation  
For me, I kept talking to my good friend M about Bitcoin. He told me about it in September and through October to November we watched it sail past $10,000, to $15,000 before we decided to dip our toes. He was dead set on Ripple and bought at about $0.20, and was supposed to come over and show me how to set it up, but on his way over, he was T-boned by a careless driver and we postponed it. In the days after, Ripple shot up and I felt like I missed the boat, and he tipped me off about another good project called ""Cardano""  

*Oh, those merry times*  

I bought some in mid December, and let me tell you that what happened was absolutely insane. For starters, Coinbase was so fucked from the insane level of sign ups, that they couldn't process new accounts. It took **THREE WEEKS** for my account to be verified, and I had to buy Bitcoin from Local Bitcoins, transfer to Binance and then swap to Cardano. What a joke, but hey I got my Cardano. Little did we realise, we were just 1 month from the top. We enjoyed stratospheric gains for one month.  

It felt different than this February, where gains have been ridiculous. Back then, you could've put your money on nearly anything and 8-10x'd in a couple weeks flat. Someone on this reddit described it really well - your money doubled, then doubled again. You'd think ""Surely this is it"", then it doubled again. Finally, it doubled again. And then once more.  

I bought 2 days before the Bitcoin top. I had no idea what happens next.  

For the unaware, alts don't really go up when BTC goes up. Money flows out of alts, into BTC as it gains. When BTC dips, it takes the market with it. But BTC rising up doesn't really take the market up because there are so many who take money out of alts to ride BTC's wave. **The best time to be in alts, is when BTC goes flat**  

And that's kinda what happened. And alts exploded.  

My small Cardano buy doubled, and then doubled, and again and again. Every day I woke up to more green in the portfolio. My mate was making bank off Ripple - it went from 20c to over $3.00. I cursed myself for not just buying Ripple at 44c or whatever it was, and I bought some at $3.15 - basically the top of the market, Ripple's highest ever price.  

I also bought some bags. FunFair went mad, why not, I'll have some. Saw crazy profit on that. ETHLend going mad? Go on then. TRON? Go on then!  

There was no wrong decision in that frenzy.  

Until there was.  

#The Copium  
The gains leveled out. Some days started to get red. Everyone was saying shit like ""Chinese New Year"", ""Wall Street Bonuses"", ""Korea FUD"". Nobody can pin why the bubble popped, but in any assets history, such an incredible period of growth just cannot be sustained. I think it was South Korea basically taking some exchanges offline and it fucked with Coin Stat websites. People panicked and sold. That caused more panic, and more sales.  

The daily gains turned red, very quickly.  

""It's just a dip"" ""Hold!"" ""We need a correction"" was the hopium of the day. Anyone ballsy enough sold, probably everyone who had been in this space since 2016. They'd seen it all before.  

Some coins slowly turned from green, to breakeven, to red.  

And it just kept going down. I remember a brief rally in April. It was a suckers rally, in May my altcoins were mostly back in profit. It went down again. Same thing in August, BTC spiked up, we all thought ""Finally, this is it!"" and then it came back down again. Over and over.

Small blips aside, the Bitcoin bear market lasted from Mid December 2018 to Mid March 2020. That's 15 months, and only then did it start rising properly. We had a false start in early 2019 after the babyish chain split of Bitcoin Cash into BCH and BSV, which plummeted the market into one of the lowest prolonged periods of red I have seen. At this point, many people were down some -80% to -95%, me included.  

#The Effect  
How did it feel? Well to be honest, weird. But it happened over such a long period of time, you just become numb to it. In fact, after periods where your portfolio barely moves 3% in a week, you actually come to enjoy the wild volatility, even when the arse is falling out of it.  

It never stops though, in October 2018, we experienced one of the sharpest in memory, when a childish squabble between Roger Ver and Craig Wright forked the Bitcoin Cash chain into BCH and Bitcoin ""Satoshi's Vision"" (christ)  

This resulted in an absolutely gut-wrenching drop which lasted until early 2019.  

Some days, the losses and gains really did affect my day to day. I've received a couple warnings from work about chart-watching and I've been snappy or elated depending on how much I lost or gained in a day. Now I just truly don't care. I have a target and if I get there, good, if not, I'll wait.

#Is that a light I see?  
2019 started out quite nicely. Price remained stable in the $3,000's until April, where it all started climbing back up again. Alts came along for the ride too. On the summer solstice, BTC broke past $10,000. I smiled as I checked my portfolio, the same day I proposed to my gorgeous fiancee *(that covers my ass in case she reads this)*. Were things looking up?  

Myeh, not quite. This period of >$10,000 lasted until about September and we came back down. Again, a quiet Christmas and then the hope of a new year brought prices up again just nosing past $10,000.  

Up to this point, I had been buying a bunch of stuff. I bought some Golem, it tripled in one of those spikes in 2018 and then I held a worthless token. My ETHLend, Funfair and Tron were basically worthless. The only times I was in profit was when Cardano, Eth or Ripple stirred from their sleep.  

My first Bitcoin buy, to actually buy and keep, was in fuckin November 2019. I set up a monthly buy, but then stopped halfway through 2020 - with Coronavirus, I could've been out of work at a moments notice so all crypto buying stopped.  

In March 2020, we saw Crypto nosedive as Coronavirus struck. This one sucked. In hindsight, these prices were a **fucking steal** - I had the balls to put only one buy in, Cardano at $0.035 and $0.038 - last week, these appreciated 31x and 27x respectively.  

And that was basically the bottom. All has risen from there.  

I made some massive, massive mistakes. I held certain shitcoins way too long, and sold ETHLEND when I broke even on it, because I didn't do any research and didn't get why it was climbing so quickly, which ultimately cost me about $4,500 in wasted gains.

I think the best thing I did was consolidate my entire portfolio. All the shit from Coinbase Earn, I just moved it all into Stellar. All the other crap, I just tied it into the good projects and Bitcoin.  

So does this current dip feel like that bear market? No. It just feels like a correction on the way to something bigger. But I do think we will see, until June, some sideways and mostly negative price action broken up with a few days of gains at a time.  

Some cardinal rules for Crypto:  

* This market is fucking irrational. It doesn't make sense that EOS enjoyed periods of insane growth after the network was basically so congested it was not functional, or after people found out that 98% of the transactions on the network was just blocks filling up with weather data from around the world...  
* Do not ever, **ever** leverage yourself to buy Crypto. I'm talking loans, credit card debt, spending money reserved for rent or mortgage. This market can and will change in the blink of an eye and it's not worth the risk.  
* **Time in the market** is truly better than **timing the market**. I tried trading a handful of times and it was a fantastic way of basically just setting fire to my money. I think my most successful trade I earned about 20 ""free"" ADA. The worst trade I did, I lost about £50 before I figured fuck it.  
* Do some fucking research! I mentioned earlier, I sold ETHLEND before it transformed into AAVE. I sold at $0.12. At it's peak, it was worth about $5.40. It annoys me nearly every fucking day.  
* We are early. Yeah, we really are. Someone on here mentioned that most people can't even tell you what Bitcoin is or does. Get in, stay in. Ride until you can take out your principal and the rest is free money.  
* Don't take it so seriously. This shit definitely affected my day-to-day. You need to learn to let it go and roll with the punches. I put in a marginal amount maybe once a month and it still felt horrible the first few times I saw deep red in the portfolio.

BNB,cryptocurrency,"Data Breach: 100,000 Binance and KuCoin API Keys Linked to 3Commas Were Leaked","TLDR at bottom

For those unaware, the 3Commas platform allows users to deploy automated trading bots to execute non-stop cryptocurrency trading, minimize risks, and shop the marketplace for bot presets. They offer DCA bots, Grid bots, Options bots, Futures, bots, HODL bots, Scalper Terminal, and full Portfolio management all from a single interface. 

This week, an anonymous person leaked 100,000 API keys connected to the crypto trading service. The anonymous individual had reached out to users/journalists in Twitter DMs claiming that they had hacked the personal information of 3Commas' users including API keys. 

The anonymous hacker claims that they intend to release their database only after personal information that could be used for doxxing is removed. They claim that they hacked 3Commas' database and that their intent to release the information stems from wanting to send a message to its users that their money and information is not safe in the hands of these companies. This seems to also be in response to the lack of action against Do-Kwon after the Luna collapse and lack of critical media coverage regarding SBF (e.g. NYT puff pieces) and the FTX collapse.  


[Link to thread](https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1608247992888295426?t=zcL9c3GYk7_4B0CReA-udA&s=19.)


The hacker also claims that they will be releasing similar information that is associated with ALL the platforms that 3Commas could be integrated with. This includes:


* Binance

* Bitfinex 

* Bitstamp 

* Bittrex

* Bybit

* Coinbase Pro

* Crypto.com

* Deribit

* Gate.io

* Gemini  

* Huobi Global 

* Kraken

* KuCoin

* OKX


[3Commas has responded to the claims](https://twitter.com/3commas_io/status/1608226169400315904?t=y__6x6yiW3nUnEYJBD_6MA&s=19.) stating that they are true and accurate, however not before blaming their users and that they may have individually fallen for phishing scams ^^[1](https://twitter.com/yeswepump/status/1608228961296781314?t=LRe1ZcWFgwdQn54GPwGRwg&s=19), ^^[2](https://twitter.com/turgut_oztunc/status/1593730899228913664?t=b9haxEK92sTOW89pyp3l2A&s=19) . [They also have a banner on their website](www.3commas.io) with a disclaimer stating that they are aware of the matter ([screenshot](https://imgur.io/a/5ufuuOm) included in case they change anything)







Over the last several months, dozens of 3Commas users found that the service had, without their consent, traded away funds on crypto exchanges they’d linked to it. Initially, 3Commas said that these users were most likely phished and insisted that the platform was safe.

The API database leaker insinuated that the 3Commas keys had been sold by someone from within the company, but 3Commas CEO Yuriy Sorokin said that “3Commas stresses that it has found no evidence during the internal investigation that any employee of 3Commas was somehow involved in attacks against the API data.”

“Since becoming aware of the suspicious activities taking place, we immediately launched an internal investigation. We will continue with the investigation in the light of the new information and also notify law enforcement authorities accordingly,” Sorokin said in the statement.

Since this has all come to light, the FBI has since begun investigating. The FBI has reached out to users affected by the 3Commas data breach.

TLDR: Anonymous hacker got access to 100k API keys from 3Commas that were linked to Kucoin and Binance. They plan to release the information once all personal information has been scrubbed hoping that it'll send a message to users that these companies are selling user information and mishandling user funds. The accounts that are currently known to be affected are those belonging to Kucoin and Binance users however that list may grow to include all exchanges that 3Commas could be integrated with.

BNB,cryptocurrency,Understanding liquidity and why a sudden $800m drop can tank a 1T market by 10%.,"Good morning everyone.

Some of you might be just coming round from your daze after yesterdays market performance. We all checked our phones to find some pretty shocking news. 

The thing I always found strange when I first entered this space and these sorts of events happened was that everything acted instantly, no matter which coin or which exchange. It all followed the same trend without a moments notice. I was also baffled at how much money could technically leave the eco system in such a short amount of time. 

The current entire crypto market cap is very roughly 1 trillion dollars. Yesterday saw just short of 1 billion dollars in liquidation. That’s 0.1% of the entire market cap. Yet everything dropped  by around 10%. 

How?

Well it’s all to do with liquidity. It boils down to this. Let’s say Microstrategy woke up today and wanted to sell all of his Bitcoins. All 150,000 of them. The current price of BTC is $26,000. 

He lists all 150,000 for $25,999 on Binance for sale. Immediately he will sell as many coins to as many buyers that have a bid in for $25,999 or more. After that, the sale will pause until buyers come in with that price. It would be a very tiny portion of his coins sold. Probably less than 50.

So he decides to list the remainder for $24,000. And again, orders are filled but not that many in comparison to the amount he holds. BTCs price has now dropped to below $24,000 because there’s no buyers or liquidity at $26,000 anymore. BTC just dropped 10% and microstrategy still has 140,000 BTC. 

In reality, the price or market cap of a coin rests solely on its liquidity properties. If there’s only enough money on the table for 1 BTC at $26,000 then it’s going to be a rough ride when someone sells.

Below are some points I’ve made regarding liquidity and what you should understand.


- Liquidity is the measure of how easily an asset can be bought or sold without causing significant price changes. In the cryptocurrency context, it reflects the ability to convert a digital asset into cash or another asset promptly. Liquidity depends on the presence of active buyers and sellers, as well as the depth of the order book.


- Liquidity acts as a measure of market stability. High liquidity implies a balanced number of buyers and sellers, resulting in smoother trade execution and less impact on prices. On the flip side, low liquidity scenarios lead to heightened price volatility. A large trade in a low-liquidity market can result in exaggerated price fluctuations.


- Market volatility, which often puzzles traders, can be attributed to liquidity dynamics. In markets with low liquidity, even small trades can cause significant price shifts. This results in the price volatility that characterizes cryptocurrency markets.


- In markets with high liquidity, large trades can be executed with minimal price impact. Bid-ask spreads remain narrow, ensuring fair pricing for traders. High liquidity also makes it harder to manipulate prices, contributing to a more accurate representation of asset values.


- Low liquidity markets are prone to price manipulation due to the influence of large holders. Executing significant trades in such scenarios can lead to slippage, where the executed price differs from the expected price due to insufficient orders to match against.

In summary, grasping liquidity is crucial for navigating the cryptocurrency landscape. It directly affects stability, volatility, and the trading experience. While high liquidity promotes stability, low liquidity demands caution due to potential price swings and manipulation risks.

It’s a lot to take in and bend your head around but it is the fundamental force of all crypto markets, even BTC with its massive market capitalisation is subject to its underlying importance.

I hope this helps, if you have any other topics you’d like me to cover please let me know! 😊

BNB,cryptocurrency,Binance and CoinMarketCap are misleading users about Proof of Reserves.,"Some of you may not know, but Binance owns CoinMarketCap (CMC). And the platform recently released what it [calls](https://twitter.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1594955634587611136) a ""Proof of Reserves"" feature. But, interestingly, CMC has used the new feature launch to inaccurately portray that Binance has provided Proof of Reserves.

&#x200B;

# What is Proof of Reserves?

First off, let's get a (brief) understanding of what Proof of Reserves actually is. Note that there is no one standard way to conduct PoR. However, Nic Carter, one of the co-founders of Coin Metrics, a crypto analytics firm, has been discussing Proof of Reserves for several years.

On his [website](https://niccarter.info/proof-of-reserves/), Nic Carter introduces PoR as:

>Proof of Reserves is the idea that custodial businesses holding cryptocurrency should create public facing attestations as to their reserves, matched up with a proof of user balances (liabilities). The equation is simple (in theory):  
>  
>*Proof of Reserves + Proof of Liability = Proof of Solvency*

I recommend you read the entire page if you have time, lots of great info in there.

&#x200B;

# Binance's PoR promises + wallet disclosure

Following the FTX collapse, the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), [promised to produce Proof of Reserves](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1590055819416330240) in a Nov 8 tweet. A few days later, Binance [publicly revealed](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/community/our-commitment-to-transparency-2895840147147652626) its hot and cold wallets. Note that Binance did not provide proof of user balances (liabilities), just a public disclosure of the wallets they control.

&#x200B;

# CMC (Binance) misleads about PoR

So (as of Nov 24), Binance has not produced Proof of Reserves. Despite this, CoinMarketCap (owned by Binance) went ahead and used Binance as an example for Proof of Reserves.

[https://twitter.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1594993576420970496](https://twitter.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1594993576420970496)

>Check out this **example of PoR data shown for** **#Binance** **exchange** 

What's more, CoinMarketCap is misleading CMC users as to what PoR is. The entire feature is being branded as a PoR feature everywhere except where the feature exists. Meanwhile, the PoR checkmark is being given to exchanges who have not even produced a real PoR attestation. Note that CMC doesn't even label the checkmark as PoR in its [user interface](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) or on [exchange pages](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6cc0ky4iz1a1.png?width=367&format=png&auto=webp&s=46386dc38da455012158147d4b43e2cc06e6df19

But, CMC is quick to describe the feature as PoR on its [website](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/cmc-launches-proof-of-reserves) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1594955634587611136).

>With this need for transparency in mind, CoinMarketCap is now **showing crypto exchanges’ proof-of-reserves on our ranking pages**...  
>  
>You can see we have added a “reserves” icon right besides the exchanges. **If an exchange has an icon, it means that they support proof-of-reserves right now**...

&#x200B;

# Maybe they are mixing up terms?

Here's a [ PoR info page provided by CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-reserves-por), which appears to have remoulded the definition of PoR from Nic Carter's website to fit CoinMarketCap's / Binance's narrative.

>Proof of Reserves (PoR) is a method using cryptographic verification to demonstrate possession of digital assets...

They seem to have vaguely redefined and remoulded what Nic Carter, one of the go-to sources for PoR discussions, wrote on his website. CMC says PoR is used ""to demonstrate their solvency"" but includes no mention of liabilities when introducing what PoR is.

Ironically, also on the page is Nic Carter's list of exchanges that voluntarily provided PoR. Down near the bottom of the list is Binance.

&#x200B;

[\\""proof of assets\\""](https://preview.redd.it/e056ivd2lz1a1.png?width=689&format=png&auto=webp&s=56408ee73edfea3197866f241a9a3353b0e8ecee)

So, CoinMarketCap (again, owned by Binance) doesn't even list Binance as having produced Proof of Reserves on this page, just **Proof of Assets with no liabilities**. Meanwhile, on Twitter, [CZ has already said](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1590694652088582144) that the wallets were released while they wait ""for the proof-of-reserves to finish."" Similarly, this is how it was [described on binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/community/our-commitment-to-transparency-2895840147147652626).

&#x200B;

# Success!

The media has already [eaten this up](https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinmarketcap-launches-proof-of-reserve-tracker-for-crypto-exchanges), also referring to it as a Proof of Reserves tracker or feature. Did journalists not look beyond the branding and launch publicity to see what the feature actually is? Are they just using PoR as a blanket term for any exchange that discloses their wallet address? Because some of CMC's ""checkmarked"" exchanges haven't actually provided PoR, including Binance. They have just disclosed wallet addresses with no form of real-time monitoring, external auditor, Merkle tree, or proof of liabilities.

Further, several exchanges that have *actually* provided PoR are omitted. Take Kraken, for example, which provided a form of auditor-assisted PoR with Merkle tree verification once in 2020 and again this year. The exact method Binance has been talking about. No checkmark. Even when this feature launched two days ago (Nov 22), the other exchanges all had the [checkmark out the door](https://web.archive.org/web/20221122110623/https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/), but not those who were ahead of the game (Kraken, BitMex, Gate.io).

Now, in comparison, CoinGecko (not owned by any exchange) [released](https://twitter.com/coingecko/status/1592493513240821760) a similar feature but actually includes details about each exchange's reserves info and is not blanket-labelling exchanges (i.e. Binance) as an example of having produced PoR, just ""exchange reserves.""

CoinGecko [definition](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-proof-of-reserves-por) of PoR:

>PoR demonstrates an institution / exchange’s ability to honor withdrawals from its platform at all times. Broadly, it consists of two parts – a current record of customers’ token deposits (known as liabilities), and a pool of tokens held within a set of exchange addresses (also known as assets). 

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

The feature branded as an indicator of ""Proof of Reserves"" only indicates that an exchange publicly disclosed all its wallets.

You decide for yourself. But, to me, CMC looks like an unreliable platform for crypto information and is being used as a megaphone to boost Binance's reputation with millions of users that rely on CMC as a source of info.",112,2022-11-25 01:13:22,56

***The full blog post with all the tables is*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24)***.***

Welcome to the monthly recap for the 3rd of 4 homemade Top Ten Crypto Index Funds. The 2020 Portfolio is made up of: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Tether, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, EOS, Binance Coin, BitcoinSV,** and **Tezos.**

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly. Did the same in 2019, 2020, and 2021. ***Learn more about the Experiment history, rules, and FAQs (including the answer to the ""WHY TETHER?!?!"" question)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **TWO YEAR UPDATE** \- **BNB** way out in front (+3,598%) **ETH** a strong second place (+2,782%).
* ***2020 Top Ten is best performing of the four Experiments (+795%)***
* Did someone say DCA?: **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +406%.**

***Some exciting new changes for*** [2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!***

1. Scaling down from four to two monthly reports.
2. Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time.
3. ***Factoring in stablecoin gains***: In the past, I have not included ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports. This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).
4. Giveaways: I’ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I’m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.
5. Friendly competition (or Battle Royale?): I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP [r/TotalCryptoMarketCap](https://np.reddit.com/r/TotalCryptoMarketCap/)) to see which one outperforms.

Here we go:

 

## Two Year Report – UP 795%

📷

The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, ETH, XRP, USDT, BCH, Litecoin, EOS, BNB, BSV,** and **Tezos**.  

December highlights for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* All 2020 Top Ten cryptos down by double digits.
* After two years, the 2020 Portfolio is +795%.
* The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio retains the title of best performing of all four Top Ten Experiments.

This group of cryptos highlights the benefits of an index fund strategy: the **+795%** return of the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio has *outperformed eight of the individual component cryptos contained within the Index.* Only by guessing right and throwing all your eggs into **Ethereum** and/or **Binance Coin** would you have performed better than spreading out the risk, index style.  

## December Ranking and Dropout Report

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**  after two years, half of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out:  **EOS**, **BSV, Tezos, Litecoin,** and **Bitcoin Cash** have been replaced by **Cardano,** **Polkadot, Solana, Luna,** and **USDC.**

At #61, **BSV** has sunk the lowest since January 2020.

## December Winners and Losers 

***December Winners*** – no winners this month: besides stablecoin **USDT**, all cryptos in this portfolio lost value.

***December Losers*** –  **Litecoin** fell -30% this month, followed by the second worst performing crypto **EOS**, down -24% in December. 

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After two years, here’s a snapshot of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment’s monthly winners and losers: 

With six monthly victories, **ETH** leads the pack.  **Tether** still has the most monthly losses, a good sign for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio.

## Two Year Update – BNB victorious, followed by second place ETH. All cryptos in positive territory. 2020 Top Ten best performing of the four Top Ten Experiments.

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio continues to be the best performing of the four [Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 100% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive territory, most have at least *triple digit price growth* and two have *four digit growth* (**BNB** and **ETH**).  **Binance Coin** continues to hold a commanding lead over second place **Ethereum.**

The initial $100 investment two years ago into first place **Binance Coin**? Currently worth **$3,699**, an increase of +3,598%.    

In second is **Ethereum,** also with quadruple digit gains, up +2,782%.

Besides **USDT**, the worst performer in the 2020 group is **EOS,** up +22% since January 2020.   

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/2k720xq9ctd81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=02721b067faea6d3e431d970081e915407d798b5

As a sector, crypto is up **+1,066%** over the two year lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.

If you were able to capture the entire crypto market since [January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) (+1,066%), you’d be doing quite a bit better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+795%) and ridiculously better than the S&P (+48%) over the same time period.  Much more on the S&P below. 

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**$185B in March 2020**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:  [**$2.6T in October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-22).

## Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/xduep0sactd81.png?width=504&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcf343e0c1b4666f8260ab5ad7cf98565fed731b

**BitDom** declined in December, ending the month at 40.2%. This is a record low when looking at the timeframe as a whole. 

For context, here are the high and low points of **BTC** domination over the two year life of the 2020 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**40.2% this month**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24).

High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.4% in December 2020**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-1-year-report/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/bsh26qvbctd81.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=0876bfcd56c29e53da60c07341ceee2d976b2b35

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio lost $2,209 in December and is now worth **$8,951** (+795%) from the initial $1k investment.  

The 2020 Portfolio remains the best performing of [the four Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 

Below is a month by month ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along:

https://preview.redd.it/pgpvfixcctd81.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ce72699d89f846a01f0cefbcad351a8d5c46df8

The portfolio has yet to experience a red month, although in [March 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/) it came close, returning a COVID induced low of +7%.

**Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios** 

So, where do we stand if we combine four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48): up +34% (total value $1,341)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36): up +504% (total value $6,044)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24): up +795% (total value $8,951)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12) up +292% (total value $3,921)

So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,257** ($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).

**That’s up +406%** on the combined portfolios, **down from**[ **last month’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23) for the Top Ten Index Fund Experiments. 

Lost in the numbers? Here’s a table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

https://preview.redd.it/qaeh607ectd81.jpg?width=511&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b6f94cea9cec2a4d888af73d3a892768195fbc2

In summary: ***That’s a +406% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four straight years***.

## Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/oonu9hcfctd81.png?width=504&format=png&auto=webp&s=22ce5dcd8f380ce292d5e50190483e662fc75996

Since the S&P 500 has returned +48% since January 1st, 2020, that same [$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) in January 2020 would be worth $1480 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 instead. 

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning **+795%**, worth **$8,951.**

***That’s a difference of $8,280.***  

***On a $1k investment!*** 

But that’s just 2020. What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,430** ($1,780 + $1,900 + $1,480 + $1,270).

That is up **+61%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+406%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

To help provide perspective, here’s a quick look at the combined four year ROI for the Top Ten cryptos vs. the S&P up to this point.

https://preview.redd.it/w08673hgctd81.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=b651956ce75d1a4a54ef4a35484dab4788ff0071

## Conclusion:

For those who have supported the Experiments over the years, thank you.  For those just getting into crypto, I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride!

BNB,cryptocurrency,"Convince me I'm wrong,There's even less adoption and use of crypto today than 6 years ago, we've taken a step backwards","Crypto has reverted and gone backwards since say 2017. Let me plead my case and let me know whether or not you agree with me. And before someone is like but, but but we have NFTs now and Defi, sure Defi is great, NFTs in their current state I think most of us can agree are trash and in reality we had NFTs way back in 2017 with Crypto Kitties, although back then we didn't call them NFT's. 

If you're someone who was around this sub, or at least involved in crypto you may understand this. So first off back in 2016/2017 there was more a sense of community. People tipped each other coins, people helped noobs get started, while we all wanted to make money it seems like most people actually had an interest in the technology and moving the space forward. Everyone was a crypto evangelist, at some points even being annoying but people tried to bring others on board, helped others get started. There was less KYC back in 2017 I believe for a period Binance had no KYC and no withdrawl limits, when they did put on withdrawl limits it was like 2 BTC per day with no KYC so pretty sweet. There was constant news about the space moving forward and adoption and in terms of use people were excited about crypto and actually using Bitcoin and crypto to buy things. Sure some of it was the novelty of doing so but I bought some winter hats and would try to buy stuff, spend my bitcoin and support companies accepting Bitcoin and it seemed many others did as well. Anytime something goes mainstream and gains more adoption sure it gets watered down a bit, its just what happens but I would venture to bet probably under 20% of people who got in since 2020 have ever made a Bitcoin purchase and I'd guess probably less than half have even sent crypto off an exchange. Even darknet markets which were a use case some people dont like to focus on but it was a huge use case and proof crypto had value and a purpose, not just buying drugs but really any high risk industry for merchant processing or any industry prone to be affected by censorship. Remember when Patreon was shutting people down and then blaming Visa and Mastercard, yeah with crypto there's no central authority to say this person can't receive money because they have the wrong views. 

Today it seems like the vast majority of people are speculating, nobody is really using the technology, a lot of the quasi social media post and earn platforms have gone downhill ie Steemit, DTube and others. A lot of the community aspect is gone, I remember back in 2017 there were tons of meetup groups and community things surrounding crypto, you can still find that today if you look hard enough but its not like it was back then. 

I think adoption is going to look much different in reality than what we thought it would look like a few years back but none the less I feel like we've taken a step backwards from where we were in say 2017 or even earler. Your thoughts?",654,2023-10-11 13:25:26,1222

&#x200B;

In what seems to be a ritual by now, XMR lags behind the pack. Whether it's regulation or something else, XMR's price has lagged behind in every metric, from Bitcoin to alts. Still better than fiat though!

&#x200B;

**9 - XRP - $148.34**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Signs of a heartbeat.](https://preview.redd.it/voy6hr75scr61.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=90eda9b7b957e601593e5b94163793841d3c4886)

Still lagging behind the pack, it looks like the former #2 of the Crypto world has begun to pick up a bit of its slack. Time will tell if this is just following in Bitcoin's footsteps, or if the SEC trial continues to pull at its pricing.

&#x200B;

**8 - ETH - $249.75**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Steady and solid, but largely moving with BTC.](https://preview.redd.it/flmcl8kiscr61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=b08f23306103d725a69100d184270ef8327f0026)

In a normal challenge, going 5x your original amount would be crazy and cause for celebration. However, in terms of this one, ETH is actually lagging behind the rest of altcoins. Still, a $2000+ celebration is in order for all the ETH holders, which is a major price milestone. High gas fees continue into 2021 however, so maybe people are skeptical about scaling issues and the time it will take to resolve them.

&#x200B;

**7 - IOTA - $360.19**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Getting untangled at last.](https://preview.redd.it/d3wm9wmxscr61.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=09eafaa6b4f518f0286feb55c13f7e8b7d791fbd)

IOTA seems to have picked up signs of life in the last month, rocketing to two new spikes that remind holders of the 2017 days. It's no all time high again (Yet), but surely this should give people enthusiastic about the project good vibes.

&#x200B;

**6 - NANO - $371.12**

&#x200B;

[A little issue with proof of work.](https://preview.redd.it/ae4kv4hctcr61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac25cde34444b956b8a7d9ebdf2de6123883f563)

NANO looked to be rising to get near its former glory when a spam attack hit the network, bottlenecking transactions and halting exchange activity. Its price has regressed in the meantime. Still, an impressive run since November can't leave people interested in the project too sour, and an update was quickly pushed to mitigate damage, so maybe it will do better in next month's challenge.

&#x200B;

**5 - VET - $483.76**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[An all time high once again.](https://preview.redd.it/afqk16o2ucr61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=845c61b20c27e3b0f1ed294ade5c0319d4939f97)

&#x200B;

VET has pierced the $0.10 mark, marking this as the first time since 2018 it has crested a new all time high. It enters price discovery mode now, so enthusiasts are excited to watch where it leads from here. 

&#x200B;

**4 - LTO - $592.99**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Touched a new all time high, retracing since then.](https://preview.redd.it/5fgxfv3iucr61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=872b2c618861059c36c5a0be5659720dbdfe68eb)

&#x200B;

LTO has seemingly become a /r/cryptocurrency fan favourite since November, hitting all time highs seemingly every month. It seems to hit a new all time high every week, retracing gains since then, but still remains in the top 300. Is more to come for LTO or was this a flash in the pan?

&#x200B;

**3 - ADA - $595.13**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Too close to the sun, Icarus.](https://preview.redd.it/ey86sz4wucr61.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3e2d80af7f4b0ea246f3e52cc13a4e06d5a3d1c)

&#x200B;

ADA started the month with a rocket past $1, smashing all time highs, then hit another blistering milestone, climbing almost to $1.50. It's since regressed slightly as people take profits and consolidation happens, but ADA's prowess is more than noticeable since challenge start.

&#x200B;

**2 - SOL - $635.74**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[If your chart looks like this, you're in good shape.](https://preview.redd.it/xsgm7q2rvcr61.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dec34cb4526dec70aeb3effde6eb06d2bb17689)

&#x200B;

SOL has been a surprise performer, absolutely smashing not 1, not 2, but 4 all time highs in this month alone. In November, there was some FUD about the supply increasing and the market cap being bloated, but it's still remained a shooting star since then.

&#x200B;

**1 - DOGE - $1137.88**

&#x200B;

DOGE continues to be the frontrunner, with spikes and dips based on Elon Musk's current sentiment and twitter posts. Still, DOGE is up so much from the start of this challenge it's looking questionable if any other coin will go anywhere near its heights.

BNB,cryptocurrency,Massive flash dip across most coins on Binance,"Ive just came from work and I got a notification from Binance that my stop loss was triggered on most of my coins. I opened Binance quickly to see what is happening and apparently there was a flash dip on most coins just a few minutes ago.

Most of main coins dipped significantly for a short period of time. Even ETH dipped down quite a lot. Btc seemed to be unaffected.

Does anyone know what happened? I quickly started buying again as the market is recovering super quickly. This was a really odd dip spike .",48,2021-09-06 13:04:14,105

BNB,cryptocurrency,"Question from an inexperienced crypto fan: how 'dangerous' is it, in your personal opinion, to keep your coins on an exchange such as binance or coinbase versus transferring to a wallet?","To give a bit of context to the question, how would you weigh this issue, while considering for example the fees related to transferring multiple coins? Or the 'risk' of either storing your keys on a digital medium/losing your keys, versus an account on such an exchange with 2 factor authentication? Does the total value of the investment matter for you personally in this decision? Does ease of staking (or even profit margin in staking) matter in deciding?

I am familiar with the phrase ""not your key, not your crypto"", but still I wonder about what this community actually considers or does.

Looking forward to learn from your input!",17,2021-08-22 08:55:03,118
