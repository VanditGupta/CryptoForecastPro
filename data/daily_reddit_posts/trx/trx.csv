TRX,cryptocurrency,How is Tron the 9th biggest cryptocurrency?!,"Tron goes under the radar, even if it has been around for 6 years (2017), which is like a thousand years in crypto. 

But whenever I read about Ton (TRX), people always say that it is a terrible project and that its founder, Justin Sun, is not to be trusted. Justin Sun is always in the news for saying something stupid and trying to advertise Tron. Usually he is just a source for memes:

&#x200B;

I believe Tron even started out as a scam with a plagiarized whitepaper?? Although that is true for other projects also.

Yet here we are: Tron is the 9th biggest ryptocurrency with a 6.2 billion market cap.

It would even be 7th if you do not count stablecoins.

Over the last 90 days, Tron is also one of the few cryptocurrencies that is actually in the green with a modest +2.4%. So it has performed relatively well.

TRX,cryptocurrency,Why is Justin Sun a Scammer and Tron a Fraudulent Crypto Project? ,"Anyone who is active on this sub knows there is a great disdain for Justin Sun and Tron. With the sub frequently comparing Sun and any projects he's involved with to things like Do Kwon/Terra Luna, SBF/FTX, and CP Zhao.

Yet unlike the names mentioned above Tron continues to move in and out of the top 10 crypto projects by market cap and Justin Sun continues to grow his Crypto empire with frequent news stories about large purchases of ETH and other crypto assets. Obviously not collapsing (yet) doesn't mean Justin Sun isn't a scammer and Tron isn't a fraudulent project - it just means it hasn't collapsed yet.

So the question is why is Justin Sun a scammer and why is Tron a Fraudulent Crypto Project? What hard evidence exists, what is just circle jerking, and what is simply speculative concern?",66,2024-07-06 15:55:31,95
TRX,cryptocurrency,"So... are we going to ignore that TRON (TRX), with 7.5 BILLION market cap, is pretty much following LUNA's footsteps?","[TRON (TRX) is currently the #14 coin by market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/). The coin has seen an insane increase over the past couple months.

TRON has recently launched its algorithmic stablecoin [USDD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usdd/). The algorithm governing the stablecoin’s dollar-peg is an arbitrage trade between USDD and TRX, Tron's network’s native token. *Hmm... this reminds me of something but I can't put my finger on it....*

Now here's this week's best offer! [You can earn up to 57% through sun.io's LP!](https://imgur.com/a/JoFQgSH) What a great deal.

According to [Defillama](https://defillama.com/peggedassets/stablecoins) USDD is #10 stablecoin by market cap, with a 20% increase over the past week, this figure is up from $90 million recorded during its day of launch on **May 5, 2022**. *Hmm... I have a vouge memory of something that happened in early May 2022...*

Oh and we haven't even checked the **project's founder, Justin Sun.**

Let's get started:

Justin Sun launched TRON's whitepaper during the ICO craze in 2017, days before China's ban on ICO's. He raised $70 million and left the country. Sun had been **tipped off by Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance.** Does this also sound familiar....? 

On top of that. [it's been also reported that he copy pasted the project's whitepaper from another coin](https://coincentral.com/community-accuses-tron-plagiarizing-whitepaper/). This only adds to the pile of cards that his so called ""algorithmic stablecoin"" is a scam waiting to collapse.

It is no coincidence that Justin also left China, days after the ICO ban was announced.

On top of all that, it's been reported that:

* He hosted a ton of fake giveaways in 2019 announcing fake winners and retracting prizes.

* He announced fake partnerships with big organizations such as Liverpool F.C., who have denied connections.

* It's been reported that Justin has sold most of his TRON coins after the ICO and bought a large chunk of ETH. Some say he owns more ETH than the projects' Co-Founder Vitalik.

[You can read more here](https://www.theverge.com/c/22947663/justin-sun-tron-cryptocurrency-poloniex)

So, what do we make of all these? Justin Sun, the creator of TRX and USDD, not only literally copy pasted everything, he has also been involved in a huge amount of sketchy dealings and scams. 

My hope is that people like Justin and projects like LUNA and TRX are wiped off entirely from the market, for this is the only way to move forward and build something meaningful.

Looking at his verified crypto address one cam easily see some shady transactions.

He also added $50 million USDT and $12 million TUSD to JustLend. This tactic of minting and immediately burning clearly shows that he's showing debtors he has TUSD which he doesn't have, just like  Sam Bankman Fried did.

TRX,cryptocurrency,I entered a Tron Telegram group with 24.000 people in order to get info about tech. An unbelievable experience.,"So I'm writing this article about the top 15 crypto projects. 
It's an IOTA blog, but this article is not aiming at ""IOTA IS THE WINNER"" or so, I absolutely don't care. 

Everyone can get rich, 3842% ROI I don't care. It's a neutral comparison.

I want to look for fields of application, feasibility, similarities, problems, rumours.

As neutral as I can. 

I can't find information about Tron, the whitepaper doesn't answer the questions, there's not a single entry in google about it. 

While entering the telegram group with 24.000 members(!), the first thing I see is a dude asking: 

""so should I buy more TRON?""

a guy named kaan answered ""If you can, yes"" 

I asked: ""I'm looking for information about Tron in terms of the CAP theorem, does anyone know if Tron is partition tolerant?

syed efti writes ""when 1000 sat""

someone writes: ""PUMP THE SHITTT""

and I ask ""this group is not really tech savvy is it?"" 

Someone answered. ""Bro you got google""

I answer: ""bro, try to google it, there are ZERO answers""

he sais ""not doing your work""

I say: ""I'm trying to write an article, I want basic tech-info about Tron, is there ANY expertise in here?""

A moderator-bot comes up and deletes a question of ""Dennis"" who is looking for a developer of Tron for an exchange listing

The bot answers: These questions are not allowed, next time you will get banned.

TRX,cryptocurrency,Something fishy is going on with the Tron Accelerator $1m developer contest,"[Tron Accelerator](https://tronaccelerator.io/) is (allegedly) a $1m contest for TRX dapp developers. Being someone who has been highly active in all blockchain dapp scenes, I have been watching this unfold. I figured I'd post it here so you guys can help put the pieces together.

Basically, tons of supposed USDT prizes for people to win by developing on TRX. This is the main reason why some eth devs decided to port games to TRX  - Not because they are ""jumping ship"" like the shillers want you to believe (In fact many of them who I know personally still plan to continue developing on Eth). They just wanted a piece of the contest prizes and its pretty easy to put an eth dapp onto tron.

Anyways, yesterday was supposed to be when they decide winners. The results werent announced and people started to get anxious. Finally today they said that they emailed all the winners. Inside the email included the following:

>Due to the unexpectedly high volume of competitive projects, we have made some adjustments to the prize structure, one of them is to award over 100+ projects instead of 56 projects. More details to be announced soon. Please stay tuned:)

Apparently they decided to change the prize payouts, dropping the lowest prize to $1k instead of $5k. Many people were upset about this in the official tron dev discord feeling they had been mislead. Some even seem to think there is something deeper going on. For example, one Super Representative candidate posts:

>Nobody even knows that they'll pay out the full 1,000,000 I can guarantee they won't. They didn't pay out the full amount last competition They're not cutting prize amounts because so many people supposedly entered, they're cutting them because they won't pay the full amount. 100 winners is not better than 57 when the majority of those winners took 30 minutes to reskin an existing smart contract on the network You can make all the excuses you want, or try to see the good in it but you're only lying to yourself When we got $75k shaved off our prize, we weren't happy because 100 winners were better than 57. They didn't even pick winners for some of the prizes.

&#x200B;

There were some people who said they received the email and won $1k, but interestingly nobody was coming out in the public saying they won a large prize. After some sleuthing, we found this [instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsgCyyGAHv-/) of apparently some random person associated with ""STOken Studio"" who appears to have won the $200k prize. Dont bother trying to google it, nothing will come up. All we were able to find about this mysterious project was this [embarassingly empty github](https://github.com/chews/stoken) with only 3 commits \[edit: it has been deleted or made private 1 day after making this post\], and this  [https://stokenstudio.firebaseapp.com/](https://stokenstudio.firebaseapp.com/) . The [smart contract code](https://github.com/chews/stoken/blob/master/contractAgent/chalicelib/STOken.sol) is nonexistent and if the website is even doing anything, it appears to be on shasta testnet. Upon analysis, one of the SR candidates from the discord jokes that this ""dapp"" is just a microsoft word plugin.

Additionally in the FAQs on tron accel website it clearly says entrants must be on mainnet:

>Can I develop a DApp that does not use smart contracts, but does use TRX?  
>  
>Yes, you can. It is OK for you to not use TVM, but you have to be on the Mainnet.

Grand prize aside, some other funny stuff: One dev decided to clone ""Shrimp Farm"" from eth to tron just as an experiment. It surprisingly got a ton of volume despite being a simple ponzi game. This led to a huge amount of clones onto tron, including Tron Anthills, Crocs, and many others. Surprisingly, although Tron Shrimp clearly had the most volume, users, and txns, it did not win a prize. BUT ONE OF THE CLONES OF THIS CLONE DID! The Anthills developer ""diego"" posted to his community that he was one of the winners!

**To summarize, so far:**

* They changed the prizes *after* the contest ended
* They allowed clones to win but not the original clone onto TRX
* They allowed contestants to win who didnt meet the criteria (being on mainnet)
* They allowed projects that arent open source to win
* The Grand Winner is a mysterious project with barely any info available
* They havent posted a public list of the winners
* Some blatant ponzi games have won prizes

If you want to watch this all unfold live, you can find the Tron dev discord [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/a254am/in_1_months_time_the_tron_discord_channel_has/) and go to the #tronaccelerator channel. Tons of FUD currently, bring popcorn. It will be interesting to see if they ever post a public list of the winners or if they just delay it in hopes that people eventually stop talking about it

**Update**:One of the official Judges (Vincent, Dapp.review) has appeared in the discord. Some of his comments:

>I think they did a screening before sending to judges. I didn’t see all submitted dapps  
>  
>The list we got is less than 40 dapps, I think it’s for big prize📷  
>  
>No I don’t have the final results

Paradoxically, this was the email that some developers received from Tron Accelerator:

>Dear TRON Developers,  This email is to notify you that, up to this point, TRON Accelerator final prizes have been announced through emails already, we would like to thank you for your hard work and enthusiasm in developing your dApps for the past 5 weeks!  Due to the unexpectedly high volume of competitive projects, we have made some adjustments to the prize structure, one of them is to award over 100+ projects instead of 56 projects. More details to be announced soon. Please stay tuned:)  Thanks again,

Adding to the list:

* There was a ""screening"" before the dapps were being even given to the judges (by who? based on what?)
* One of the judges himself does not have the final results yet the email claims that all prizes were announced through emails",1010,2019-01-12 03:24:18,334

so what does it all mean? It means if you would like to withdraw your assets out of FTX, you have a choice of swapping your whatever assets to TRX, BTT, JST, SUN, and HT token. They are owned by Justin Sun. Here is a funny part and I could say outright this is illegal. The man just try to reduce his liabilities by f\*\*king his users once more time.

This is the price of TRX on spot market on FTX.

Basically, if you have $1 million dollars worth of assets and you would like to withdraw via Huobi (owned by Justin Sun). You would have to buy TRX, then send it to Huobi, then sell it. At the end, you lost nearly 5 times, end up having only $200k.

Not only the users was already f\*\*\*ed. This clown decided to f\*\*\* them once more time. Either you got something (4-5 times less than what you own) or nothing. It is like take it or leave it.

This clown just want to reduce his debt and decided to sacrifice his customers.

Who benefits in the end?

1. Sam Bankman-Fried, because he reduces his liability.
2. Justin Sun. He sends his tokens to FTX and sells them who needs to get out from FTX.

Those people are the reasons for outsiders and governments around the world to attack cryptos in general.

Well, let them all die so we could move on.

I mean, what the hell law enforcement in the US is doing? Just allow it to happen?

Let me get it straight: I have no tokens locked up on FTX nor I own any tokens associated with him and Justin Sun. But seeing this kinda action harming the crypto industry and people makes me sick.

I don't know what to advise you guys who have tokens locked up there. Maybe seek advice from your lawyers.

Edit #1: He has a hole of $9 billion dollars, right (probably lost due to a psychopath in Alameda Research, who lost it all to yield farming and seeding new project). If all users and investors decide to get out of FTX via this kinda mechanism, basically he only owes those people $1.8 billion dollars. Because people decide to take 4-5 times loss.

TRX,cryptocurrency,TRON Founder Justin Sun Sparks Concerns After $865 Million TUSD Minting,,87,2023-09-17 12:24:42,125

TRX,cryptocurrency,Tron already launched its stablecoin and it looks very similar to terra USD,"The range of stablecoins or stable cryptocurrencies has recently added a new alternative. It is Decentralized USD (USDD) or ""decentralized USD"", a cryptocurrency from the Tron network that has parity with the US dollar and relies on an algorithm for its issuance.

The positive thing about this is that the integration of an algorithmic stablecoin is that it guarantees the inclusion of new projects and blockchain development by having a stable and operable pair for such ecosystem, so most likely we will soon be observing projects in pre-sale and pre-launch phase for the TRX blockchain as LunaFi, Minosis Token, CHO and among all kinds of emerging and promising projects for the Tron ecosystem.

This Tron stablecoin focuses on decentralization, lead developer Justin Sun explained when announcing the project. The idea regarding its market value is that it will maintain 1:1 parity with the US dollar, as do other stablecoins such as Tether (USDT), USD coin (USDC) or DAI (DAI).

The first USDD units were issued on May 5. According to its official Twitter account, its main features are high transaction speed, low fees and scalability potential.

In addition to Tron, the stablecoin is available on Ethereum and BNB Chain networks. Twenty days after its launch, it has already accumulated a market capitalization of USD 544 million, according to CoinGecko data.

On the morning of May 25 (UTC), the cryptocurrency had a brief depeg (i.e., it lost parity with its underlying asset, the dollar) and reached its historical low of USD 0.98, although it has already recovered its original value.

According to the project's whitepaper, the next stages include the launch of the USDD test network and the main USDD network, projected for October 10 and November 30, respectively. From December 30, meanwhile, USDD would be available for any Tron mainnet user to issue the stablecoin.


For the time being, however, the USDD stablecoin can already be purchased on decentralized finance protocols (DeFi) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) such as Uniswap, Curve Finance, Kyber Network, PancakeSwap, SunSwap and Poloniex. It can also be traded on centralized exchanges such as Huobi, KuCoin, Poloniex, gate.io, Bitget, Bybit and LBank.

With respect to reserves backing investors against potential failures of the algorithm, Tron envisions the creation of the autonomous decentralized Tron Reserve DAO (Tron Reserve), which will initially raise USD 10,000 from investments from ""blockchain industry players."" This first stage in USDD's history, which began on May 5, relies mostly on the participation of institutional players.",218,2022-05-27 17:52:36,163

It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.

20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that

29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",14819,2021-02-09 12:03:25,1588

TRX,cryptocurrency,Ethereum reclaims USDT dominance against Tron after 2 years,,113,2024-11-26 02:25:56,17
TRX,cryptocurrency,Not a single top 100 Alt from 2021/2022 has hit a new ATH against BTC. ,"An Alt to BTC pair tells how a crypto asset is performing against BTC over a period of time. Perhaps the most famous alt to btc pair is ETH to BTC and although ETH is up in USD it has never hit a new ATH against BTC.

https://preview.redd.it/eyhhd1wf946e1.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bc377c08596648b802ac69b4ef20f8684f55c87

In fact if you purchased ETH during the ETH to BTC ATH on June 11th 2017 you'd be up \~11X in USD on your investment. But had you bought BTC instead you'd be up over 33x...

https://preview.redd.it/gh4hhi9y946e1.png?width=1671&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ceff32260d5b66321b634b363200a89a90a28a1

The fact is almost every single alt will be outperformed by BTC over time and although a few alts may break that trend especially in the short term. Holding alts through multiple cycles is risky at best and foolish at worst.

If we look at the top 100 Alts from 2021, not a single alt from the top 100 in 2021 has managed to break it's 2021 or 2022 ATH against BTC.

[https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20211123023737\/https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en](https://preview.redd.it/x4to82txa46e1.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2620245e886d4244b02ed05238bdf2760246efa)

Now you're probably thinking one of the following. So I'll preemptively address them.

* ""Alt season is just getting started this isn't a fair comparison""
* ""Ya But I'm up in USD on my investment""
* ""I don't want to trade because taxes are complicated""
* ""It's safer to hold and your grandchildren will thank you""
* ""Stop trying to get people to sell""
* ""I'm not a trader I make a plan and stick to it""
* ""You're a trashy BTC Maxi""

So let's break these down one by one.

**\* ""Alt Season is just getting started""**

BTC Dominance has definitely fallen but if you're gambling on future gains you have to first accept it's a gamble, and the current break down could be the farthest that it goes. If you have gains it's not a bad thing to realize gains.

**\* ""Ya but I'm up in USD on my investment""**

If that's you, you either purchased a long time ago in a bear market and held through a bull market, and a bear market - and you would most likely be up even more if you just purchased BTC. Alternatively you are a new purchaser and you got some nice gains on the breakdown of BTC dominance.

If you held your ALT from 2021 to today you are guaranteed to be down significantly compared to just holding BTC.

**\* ""I don't want to trade because taxes are complicated""**

Ya Taxes are complicated but that only matters if you're in profit. If you hold your alt to the top and back down because ""you're a long term holder"", you are simply making bad investment decisions.

**\* ""It's safer to hold and your grandchildren will thank you""**

Please STOP with this nonsense, Long term nearly every Crypto asset will not only bleed value against BTC but also bleed value in USD. Don't believe me check the top 100 crypto assets in 2017, 2021, and 2024 and count how many assets from 2017 are still in the top 100 today.

**\* ""Stop trying to get people to sell""**

I'm not trying to get people to sell, I'm trying to get people to stop with the the nonsense where they demonize selling. You can hold your alt of your choice just don't reinforce the mindless selling alts is bad philosophy.

**\* ""I'm not a trader I make a plan and stick to it""**

It's always good to stick to a plan in investments and to think rationally but if your plan is to hold your alt for the next ten years, just buy BTC instead.

**\* ""You're a trashy BTC Maxi""**

I'm not a BTC Maxi I wouldn't have 98% of my crypto investments in rCC Moons if I was a BTC maxi.

\-----

Another not so Fun Fact only two of the top 30 crypto assets in 2021 have hit a new USD ATH since... Solana and Tron... but both are still down compared to their 2021 ALT to BTC ATHs.",763,2024-12-11 01:15:44,364
TRX,cryptocurrency,Get your crypto off Binance now. The bromance between CZ and Tron’s Justin Sun is the last red flag,"I can’t even keep up with the accusations against Binance and CZ. One of the biggest red flags to me is that he has a close relationship with Justin Sun, who is clearly a scammer. In this article, an analysis by YouTuber and crypto investigator Coffeezilla revealed that Sun secretly minted 94% of allegedly decentralized stablecoin USDD, then advertised an alarming “392% to 584%” APY staking program on Sun.io. His Huobi exchange token also tanked by 93% in minutes today before Sun said he was putting 100 million USDD to provide liquidity blaming a few leveraged positions causing the crash. 93%?? 

CZ being connected to Sun either as a business partner or as a friend is a terrible sign. Get your crypto off now and into a cold wallet. If you are letting your coins sit on Binance then don’t cry to this sub afterwards when you lose them. And if you own any Tron you must hate money.

They claimed customer assets are fully backed on Binance.  They said you shouldn't trust (other) exchanges and championed proof of reserves. Then they published their proof of reserves *article* on 10th November at about UTC 13:00:00 or 1PM UTC (the actual snapshot taken earlier obviously) . But **only 20 hours** after publishing, Binance moved 2.7 Billion USDT to another wallet. This wallet is not disclosed or tagged as a Binance wallet and not present in their ""Proof of Reserves"" publishing.

There are also some additional funds missing from other wallets in their proof of reserves snapshot. The second Tron Binance wallet is missing around 2.4 Billion and the third is missing 500 Million(screenshots in Appendix). The bulk of these funds seem to have went missing on the 14th Nov.

. 

In the case of the second and third wallets, at least these funds *might* be explained by users actually withdrawing although this can be up for debate. Even then, there's no way to explain an exchange simple shifting billions in funds into some brand new undisclosed wallet in the case of the first wallet. And they did this **only 20 hours** after publishing their 'proof' of reserves snapshot. 

Sure, companies have the right to manage and store their funds in whatever way they like. They aren't bound to keep it in any particular wallet. But that begs the question, why not just disclose their new wallet with a simple addition to their published proof of reserves statement. Why not properly organize and manage their funds so that they wouldn't look shady making such transactions after  the fact(of publishing reserves). Why not even post something as basic as tweet to provide transparency to users in all of the chaos we are experiencing now as the CEO tweets about things of much less significance. They should know trust in the space is at an all time low.  But instead, users like me have to dig through tons of data to figure out something they could have easily disclosed. Shady as heck. Whether this is funny business they are engaged in or just management incompetence, either way it is not good at all.

TRX,cryptocurrency,If you were starting today with 5k USD? ,"Hello r/CryptoCurrency

I want toget into the crypto space (yes, partly because of all the hype) mostly because I've been thinking about it for a long time. I'm not trying to time the market clearly as BTC is reaching an ATH.

I understand that the crypto space is very different from the traditional stock market, so I look at this as a risk-seeking investment.

I'm not trying to get rich quick, but I do want to experiencing buying some crypto.

So my question to you is that if you had 5k USD to buy a few different coins, what would you buy?

  
Edit: Wow! This is my first time interacting with this community and I must say thank you to everyone! I did not expect this sort of response. Looks like I have a lot to learn, so the 5k stays put and I learn all about how to acquire and setup a hardware wallet, along with DCA (had to google that!).

TRX,cryptocurrency,FTX Is Taking Back Funds From Users Who Withdrew on 11th November,"FTX official Twitter released an update yesterday that some number of users who withdrew funds from FTX International on the 11th face having these funds taken back. It is not certain what group or number of users are affected. The funds are being returned to FTX, to be accessible and adjudicated upon by bankruptcy courts. As it is the entire FTX group including FTX US that filed for bankruptcy, it is unclear why FTX has not stated that this also affects FTX US withdrawals.

FTX and SBF also agreed to a credit facility with Justin Sun and his DAO Tron to permit withdrawals but only using Sun-owned token BTT,  TRX, SUN, JST, and HT. This credit facility was instituted 10th Nov such that FTX may also be referring to funds transferred out through this facility on the 11th as well, as any assets left on the platform at bankruptcy time would have already been declared through courts.

Lastly, very confusingly, Bahamas regulators have acknowledged seizing assets from FTX. However it is also very unclear whether this seizure refers to the entire sum of missing funds of FTX assets or just some portion of it. The tweet may *also* be referring to the 'stolen' sum of money that represents the balance of what regulators did not seize. These funds however are only reclaimable if the hacker(s) made a rookie move and utilized centralized exchanges.",2786,2022-11-21 10:55:43,1030

According to the data, Sun has been transferring a significant amount of True USD to Binance in order to attempt a grab on SUI token in Binance launchpad.

In two separate transactions on May 1, Sun transferred a total of 115.1 million TUSD to Binance. The first transfer took place at 08:57:54 on May 1, with Sun sending 59 million TUSD to Binance. Just 14 minutes later, at 09:11:36, Sun sent another TUSD 56.1 million to the exchange.

TRX,cryptocurrency,Actually unpopular opinion: Tron is a good coin.,"Oh yeah, here we go...

I play a game called Chainz Arena. It's a simple idle RPG that lets you earn real crypto, and works cross-chain allowing users to choose Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Matic, etc. Whichever crypto you choose becomes your main crypto and all withdrawals and transfers have to be done through that once you've made your choice.

A lot of newer players choose Bitcoin or Ethereum because they have a much better reputation, and who wouldn't want to make some Bitcoin or Ethereum just from playing a game? However the veteran players all know that Tron is the best choice. Instant transfers, zero fees, and no hiccups. There isn't any crypto tribalism going on over there, it's simply practicality. Tron is faster. Tron is cheaper. 

Yeah sure there are new ideas out there that are doing a great job at what they do, but this post isn't about them. 

Tron gets slept on. Apparently no one wants to make NFTs for just a few cents. Apparently people like spending money just to transfer money. People seem to like waiting 30 minutes for their money to show up. I guess people don't like making passive income on their held assets. No one wants to make Dapps with miniscule gas fees...
All this is in one coin, and it's been doing all of this for a very long time now...

I feel like an updated version is long due and so here we are.

As usual, if something is wrong or you would like to make a correction, feel free to comment. It's obviously hard to sum up each project in a few words, but I tried my best.

Terms used:

* If I refer to layer-2 solutions, that means a protocol or framework built on top of an existing blockchain and trying to increase transaction speed or scaling.
* [PoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work): Proof of Work
* [PoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake): Proof of Stake

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009 and since then it has become much more of a Store of Value than a currency, given its scarcity and high security, although layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network allows for fast and cheap transactions.
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** the coin of the Ethereum blockchain, the first smart contract platform and the one having the biggest ecosystem of decentralized applications around: since ETH price is used to pay fees to interact with the network, a bigger ecosystem means higher demand. It is (and will be) used for staking in Ethereum 2.0 (which is PoS).
3. **Tether (USDT):** the most discussed stablecoin around, pegged to the dollar price although many believe it is not fully backed: for this reason its market cap has been decreasing for the first time ever and other stablecoins are gaining traction.
4. **Binance Coin (BNB):** the official Binance coin and the one used to pay fees on the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain like Ethereum but less decentralized and with cheaper fees (not counting any layer 2 solutions).
5. **Cardano (ADA):** the coin of the PoS blockchain Cardano, created by the Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and developed strictly following peer-reviewed research, which slowed down development. Lots of partnerships and a big community make it one of the biggest ETH contenders.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** a centralized coin trying to redefine online payments, has had a rough time after the SEC went after it but seemingly it's coming out on top.
7. **USD Coin (USDC):** another stablecoin tied to the dollar and managed by the company Circle. Considered more trustworthy than Tether, it's been growing non-stop adoption-wise.
8. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** such wow, even higher ranking than last time. *sigh*
9. **Polkadot (DOT):** it's the coin of Polkadot, a multichain protocol aiming to connect different chains, both public and private, allowing to transfer data between one another or to create new custom blockchains. ChainLink's oracle pallet and Kusama are examples of projects built on top of it.
10. **Binance USD (BUSD):** another stablecoin pegged to the dollar, managed by Binance in partnership with Paxos.
11. **Uniswap (UNI):** the first token on the list, it's used to govern the decentralized trading protocol Uniswap, probably the biggest and most known DeFi application built on Ethereum.
12. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** a fork of Bitcoin trying to increase scalability and lower transaction fees increasing the blockchain block size, which achieves these features but reduces [decentralization](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f32dac47-a7a6-4e5d-af5b-28e4f1d87287).
13. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin younger brother, been around since 2011. It's based on the Bitcoin code but with some tweaks, lowering transaction speed and cost, many sees it as the ""silver"" of crypto since it's been around for so long.
14. **Chainlink (LINK):** between one Ganon and the other Link is also the official token of ChainLink, a network that basically bridges off-chain data with smart contracts: an example is Synthetix, a derivatives protocol that uses Chainlink to get the price feed of a certain asset on their smart contract.
15. **Solana (SOL):** one of the latest Ethereum contenders, launched in 2020 and offering possibly the highest layer-1 thoughput of all (50k transaction per second!), but is still somewhat centralized (although this is being addressed) and has yet to build a competitive ecosystem.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** it's a tokenized version of Bitcoin so it can be used on the Ethereum network and in DeFi applications.
17. **Polygon (MATIC):** the most popular layer-2 solution for Ethereum, Matic is the official coin of Polygon and used to pay fees on it: many Ethereum applications are moving there but it's still not easy to use with few exchanges supporting it directly.
18. **Ethereum Classic (ETC):** native token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain, a hard fork of Ethereum that claims to be more tied to Ethereum original plan. It has suffered various 51% attacks in the past years.
19. **Stellar (XLM):** created by an ex-Ripple founder, its aim is to become a currency and to allow to trade assets in a cheap and fast way. Last time I joked it was a 40c stablecoin, now I wished that held true.
20. **THETA (THETA):**  The token of THETA, a decentralized video delivery network (in a p2p fashion), used mainly for governance.
21. **DAI (DAI):** the biggest stablecoin not pegged 1-to-1 (or at least not claiming to) to the dollar, but soft-pegged and using cryptocurrencies deposited in smart contracts to collaterize the newly minted tokens.
22. **Internet Computer (ICP):** after its disastrous launch earlier this year, it almost overthrew Dogecoin as the biggest meme in the space. Jokes aside, it's a blockchain aiming to revolutionize the current internet, claiming to run at the same speed as the current web.
23. **VeChain (VET):**  Once everyone's favorite coin in this sub, was hit hard in the May crash and only lately recovering. Vechain is a blockchain focusing on business use-cases and supply chain management, VET (and VTHO) are the blockchain's official coins.
24. **Filecoin (FIL):**  the most popular IPFS (Interplentary File System), a peer-to-peer storage network without having to rely on cloud storage companies.
25. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron's founder Justin Sun is like Jian-Yang, great at repackaging other projects (thanks to u/fbslo on the last post). Jokes aside, it's a blockchain platform for decentralized applications more focused on content sharing and entertainment.
26. **Monero (XMR):**  Monero's goal is  to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, Monero obscures even senders and recipients whereas BTC doesn't. 
27. **Aave (AAVE):** a lending-borrowing decentralized protocol on Ethereum (and Polygon), the AAVE token grants discounted fees on the platform and act as a governance token.
28. **TERRA (LUNA):** Terra is a blockchain protocol offering a variety of applications, from stablecoins to synthetic assets and stocks. LUNA is the native token used to stabilize the price of UST (the TERRA stablecoin) and peg it to the dollar, and can be used to pay fees on the network.
29. **EOS (EOS):** another PoS blockchain launched in 2018, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It is designed to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology. 
30. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the native token of the Crypto.com chain and the Crypto.com exchange. Similar to the BNB token, it is closely tied to the success of the exchange.
31. **AMP (AMP):** it's an Ethereum token and it's used as collateral on the Flexa network, covering any financial transactions that fail if the need arises.
32. **Axie Infinity (AXS):** without a doubt the most popular blockchain game, a mix of Pokémon and Tamagotchi that follows the Play-To-Earn model. AXS is the token used for governance and soon staking.
33. **PancakeSwap (CAKE):** the most popular decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain, it started off as a copy of the Uniswap AMM model to then provide a variety of services.
34. **FTX Token (FTT):** the native token of the FTX platform, specialized in trading derivatives. It can be used as collateral or for discounts on trading fees.
35. **Bitcoin BEP2 (BTCB):** another tokenized version of Bitcoin, this time on the Binance Smart Chain.
36. **The Graph (GRT):**  It is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS like Filecoin. Basically simplyfing the retrieval of data on blockchains for developers and applications.
37. **Algorand (ALGO):** founded by the MIT professor Silvio Micali, it's a PoS blockchain supporting smart contracts, with low fees and high throughput of operations.
38. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):**  A utility token related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex. 
39. **Maker (MKR):** Maker is a token on the ethereum blockchain use for governance of the MakerDAO and Maker protocol, the organization behind the DAI stablecoin.
40. **Cosmos (ATOM):** dubbed the ""internet of blockchains"" by its founders, it solves the problem of interoperability between blockchains and provides tools to developers to build their own blockchains. Atom is the coin powering the platform and some notable projects built on top of it are Terra and Crypto.com chain.
41. **SHIBA INU (SHIB):** a meme coin that exploded in May, recently ShibaSwap was launched to give some sort of use-case to the coin which got a 3% score by DeFi Safety (later updated to 35%).
42. **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** a hard fork of a hard fork (BCH), it claims to be the true Satoshi Nakamoto vision of Bitcoin with an even bigger block size. Can't come up with a better joke than last time, I'm sorry.
43. **Tezos (XTZ):** another PoS Ethereum competitor. XTZ is the official coin used for governance and staking. One characteristic is that it is unforkable: it's impossible to create duplicates as instead happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum.
44. **Klaytn (KLAY):** a blockchain using a hybrid design between public and private chains, allowing anyone to create their own chain easily and without any technical knowledge, trying to appeal to companies and institutions mainly.
45. **NEO (NEO):**  *Noone can be told what it is, you'll have to see if for yourself.* Just kidding: launched in early 2014, it's a blockchain not too different from Ethereum where NEO is the coin used for governance. It has a Smart Economy System using digital assets (linked to a physical one) and verificable digital identities on smart contracts. 
46. **IOTA (MIOTA):**  open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things,  it uses a inventive blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same, with zero transactions fees and good scalability.
47. **Compound (COMP):** it's the governance token of Compound, a borrowing and lending platform not too different from Aave, launched in 2018 and with one of the biggest locked value of DeFi applications.
48. **TerraUSD (UST):** it's a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is available in different blockchains and it's getting more and more adoption, rising the price of Luna (which is directly tied to the demand for UST).
49. **Avalanche (AVAX):**  open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange. With an high throughput and good scalability, anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. 
50. **Theta Fuel (TFUEL):** it's another native token of the Theta blockchain, it acts as a gas token to power the operations on the blockchain and is used for payments to relayers (users sharing their computing power).

TRX,cryptocurrency,What is the likelihood that Tron could collapse?,"What is the likelihood that Tron could collapse?

If USDD completely depegs, is there a good chance that Justin Sun rug pulls and the top 20 coin recreates Luna’s fate?

Or is this just some sort of FUD? I personally think the network is trash, but I’m just curious what others think.

What value does it bring? And do you trust another algorithmic stable coin? Seems like it’s ripe for a bank run, considering it’s below .96 cents.

Maybe Do Kwan would like to get some of the attention off his back. I think if it did collapse, it would spur even more attention from regulators…

TRX,cryptocurrency,"Now that we're in a bear market, is anyone actually still using your blockchain?","I love metrics. So I am constantly analysing data to compare and validate my theories on which blockchains and projects will survive and demonstrate the most upside potential. One metric, I look at often is the daily active users. It's a great metric to tell whether the chain is being used.

**What are Daily Active Users?**

This is simply the number of addresses on the blockchain that perform at least one transaction on a particular day. If there are 1000 addresses sending transaction, then that implies 1000 people used the blockchain.

**Why is it important?**

A blockchain will be successful if people are using it. That is an obvious assertion. If lots of people are making transactions, then the project has inherent utility. If its being effectively used during a bear market, then *there is potential for great upside during a bull run*.

**Why compare to the November highs?**

During the peak of the bullrun, we saw enormous take up and investment in crypto. Millions of new users creating their accounts, interacting with the blockchain, experimenting with dApps etc. It was sometimes difficult to find the data for the exact date, so all results were taken on or close to 10 November 2021, as this was the date of Bitcoin's all time high.

By comparing the current daily users to that date, we can ascertain a decent perspective on which users decided to stick around, or perhaps even which projects are still attracting new users, despite the bear market.

**What data could be missing?**

An obvious hole is that this shows the blockchain data only. Any transactions made on exchanges will not be counted towards the daily active users.

Another possible gap in the data comes from the impact of bots. Many blockchains have bots performing automated tasks, and these appear the same as any other user.

The date I chose was base don the Bitcoin price, and likely doesn't perfectly coincide with the all time highest daily active users on any particular chain - that could of course occur any day.

**Examples:**

The following is an examples are for Polkadot and Avalanche. I checked the published statistics on the [Polkadot](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=account) and [Avalanche](https://stats.avax.network/dashboard/overview/) websites, and then compared them to data on Messari and/or Glassnode. This is the same thing I did to complete the table below.

**Conclusion**

I will reserve judgement for now as to which projects show more or less potential for value increase based on their daily active users only. Suffice it to say, obviously for a project to become successful, adoption is key.

How does your project choice measure up? If you are concerned about your investments, check the numbers against several other sources. Messari would be another good place to start.

TRX,cryptocurrency,Justin Sun the founder of TRON is trying something which is either pure genius or really really dumb.,"Justin Sun the founder of TRON has just exchanged 82 million worth of $USDC to $DAI in some sort of arbitrage attempt.

Both $USDC and $DAI have both depegged, both are trading at around ninety four cents.

The thing that is puzzling about this trade is that the DAI is heavily backed by USDC so if USDC goes down it's probably taking DAI down with it. It's a really confusing trade but perhaps he is some sort of trading genius and knows something we don't.

#The Elation  
For me, I kept talking to my good friend M about Bitcoin. He told me about it in September and through October to November we watched it sail past $10,000, to $15,000 before we decided to dip our toes. He was dead set on Ripple and bought at about $0.20, and was supposed to come over and show me how to set it up, but on his way over, he was T-boned by a careless driver and we postponed it. In the days after, Ripple shot up and I felt like I missed the boat, and he tipped me off about another good project called ""Cardano""  

*Oh, those merry times*  

I bought some in mid December, and let me tell you that what happened was absolutely insane. For starters, Coinbase was so fucked from the insane level of sign ups, that they couldn't process new accounts. It took **THREE WEEKS** for my account to be verified, and I had to buy Bitcoin from Local Bitcoins, transfer to Binance and then swap to Cardano. What a joke, but hey I got my Cardano. Little did we realise, we were just 1 month from the top. We enjoyed stratospheric gains for one month.  

It felt different than this February, where gains have been ridiculous. Back then, you could've put your money on nearly anything and 8-10x'd in a couple weeks flat. Someone on this reddit described it really well - your money doubled, then doubled again. You'd think ""Surely this is it"", then it doubled again. Finally, it doubled again. And then once more.  

I bought 2 days before the Bitcoin top. I had no idea what happens next.  

For the unaware, alts don't really go up when BTC goes up. Money flows out of alts, into BTC as it gains. When BTC dips, it takes the market with it. But BTC rising up doesn't really take the market up because there are so many who take money out of alts to ride BTC's wave. **The best time to be in alts, is when BTC goes flat**  

And that's kinda what happened. And alts exploded.  

My small Cardano buy doubled, and then doubled, and again and again. Every day I woke up to more green in the portfolio. My mate was making bank off Ripple - it went from 20c to over $3.00. I cursed myself for not just buying Ripple at 44c or whatever it was, and I bought some at $3.15 - basically the top of the market, Ripple's highest ever price.  

I also bought some bags. FunFair went mad, why not, I'll have some. Saw crazy profit on that. ETHLend going mad? Go on then. TRON? Go on then!  

There was no wrong decision in that frenzy.  

Until there was.  

#The Copium  
The gains leveled out. Some days started to get red. Everyone was saying shit like ""Chinese New Year"", ""Wall Street Bonuses"", ""Korea FUD"". Nobody can pin why the bubble popped, but in any assets history, such an incredible period of growth just cannot be sustained. I think it was South Korea basically taking some exchanges offline and it fucked with Coin Stat websites. People panicked and sold. That caused more panic, and more sales.  

The daily gains turned red, very quickly.  

""It's just a dip"" ""Hold!"" ""We need a correction"" was the hopium of the day. Anyone ballsy enough sold, probably everyone who had been in this space since 2016. They'd seen it all before.  

Some coins slowly turned from green, to breakeven, to red.  

And it just kept going down. I remember a brief rally in April. It was a suckers rally, in May my altcoins were mostly back in profit. It went down again. Same thing in August, BTC spiked up, we all thought ""Finally, this is it!"" and then it came back down again. Over and over.

Small blips aside, the Bitcoin bear market lasted from Mid December 2018 to Mid March 2020. That's 15 months, and only then did it start rising properly. We had a false start in early 2019 after the babyish chain split of Bitcoin Cash into BCH and BSV, which plummeted the market into one of the lowest prolonged periods of red I have seen. At this point, many people were down some -80% to -95%, me included.  

#The Effect  
How did it feel? Well to be honest, weird. But it happened over such a long period of time, you just become numb to it. In fact, after periods where your portfolio barely moves 3% in a week, you actually come to enjoy the wild volatility, even when the arse is falling out of it.  

It never stops though, in October 2018, we experienced one of the sharpest in memory, when a childish squabble between Roger Ver and Craig Wright forked the Bitcoin Cash chain into BCH and Bitcoin ""Satoshi's Vision"" (christ)  

This resulted in an absolutely gut-wrenching drop which lasted until early 2019.  

Some days, the losses and gains really did affect my day to day. I've received a couple warnings from work about chart-watching and I've been snappy or elated depending on how much I lost or gained in a day. Now I just truly don't care. I have a target and if I get there, good, if not, I'll wait.

#Is that a light I see?  
2019 started out quite nicely. Price remained stable in the $3,000's until April, where it all started climbing back up again. Alts came along for the ride too. On the summer solstice, BTC broke past $10,000. I smiled as I checked my portfolio, the same day I proposed to my gorgeous fiancee *(that covers my ass in case she reads this)*. Were things looking up?  

Myeh, not quite. This period of >$10,000 lasted until about September and we came back down. Again, a quiet Christmas and then the hope of a new year brought prices up again just nosing past $10,000.  

Up to this point, I had been buying a bunch of stuff. I bought some Golem, it tripled in one of those spikes in 2018 and then I held a worthless token. My ETHLend, Funfair and Tron were basically worthless. The only times I was in profit was when Cardano, Eth or Ripple stirred from their sleep.  

My first Bitcoin buy, to actually buy and keep, was in fuckin November 2019. I set up a monthly buy, but then stopped halfway through 2020 - with Coronavirus, I could've been out of work at a moments notice so all crypto buying stopped.  

In March 2020, we saw Crypto nosedive as Coronavirus struck. This one sucked. In hindsight, these prices were a **fucking steal** - I had the balls to put only one buy in, Cardano at $0.035 and $0.038 - last week, these appreciated 31x and 27x respectively.  

And that was basically the bottom. All has risen from there.  

I made some massive, massive mistakes. I held certain shitcoins way too long, and sold ETHLEND when I broke even on it, because I didn't do any research and didn't get why it was climbing so quickly, which ultimately cost me about $4,500 in wasted gains.

I think the best thing I did was consolidate my entire portfolio. All the shit from Coinbase Earn, I just moved it all into Stellar. All the other crap, I just tied it into the good projects and Bitcoin.  

So does this current dip feel like that bear market? No. It just feels like a correction on the way to something bigger. But I do think we will see, until June, some sideways and mostly negative price action broken up with a few days of gains at a time.  

Some cardinal rules for Crypto:  

* This market is fucking irrational. It doesn't make sense that EOS enjoyed periods of insane growth after the network was basically so congested it was not functional, or after people found out that 98% of the transactions on the network was just blocks filling up with weather data from around the world...  
* Do not ever, **ever** leverage yourself to buy Crypto. I'm talking loans, credit card debt, spending money reserved for rent or mortgage. This market can and will change in the blink of an eye and it's not worth the risk.  
* **Time in the market** is truly better than **timing the market**. I tried trading a handful of times and it was a fantastic way of basically just setting fire to my money. I think my most successful trade I earned about 20 ""free"" ADA. The worst trade I did, I lost about £50 before I figured fuck it.  
* Do some fucking research! I mentioned earlier, I sold ETHLEND before it transformed into AAVE. I sold at $0.12. At it's peak, it was worth about $5.40. It annoys me nearly every fucking day.  
* We are early. Yeah, we really are. Someone on here mentioned that most people can't even tell you what Bitcoin is or does. Get in, stay in. Ride until you can take out your principal and the rest is free money.  
* Don't take it so seriously. This shit definitely affected my day-to-day. You need to learn to let it go and roll with the punches. I put in a marginal amount maybe once a month and it still felt horrible the first few times I saw deep red in the portfolio.

TRX,cryptocurrency,“A Dark Day For Bitcoin”: Tron Founder Justin Sun Slaps Coinbase’s Wrist On cbBTC Arrival,,0,2024-09-18 17:41:35,9
TRX,cryptocurrency,The SEC vs Justin Sun (TRON) Explained,"The [SEC Has Charged](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-59) Justin Sun & related entities over ‘Fraud & Other Securities Law Violations’ - The SEC’s charges allege Tron’s Native Token, TRX, is a security.

* The SEC’s charges target Justin Sun and 3 of ‘his wholly-owned companies,’ Tron Foundation Limited, BitTorrent Foundation, and Rainberry, formerly BitTorrent.
* The SEC alleges TRX and the BitTorrent cryptocurrency BTT constituted unregistered offers and sales of ‘crypto asset securities.’ In addition, Sun and the entities were charged with ‘fraudulently manipulating the secondary market for TRX through extensive wash trading.’
* Charges were also brought due to an alleged ‘scheme to pay celebrities to tout TRX and BTT without disclosing their compensation.’ The SEC also brought charges against the celebrities involved in the scheme.

According to the SEC, Sun violated ‘antifraud and market manipulation provisions’ when he used wash trading to inflate TRX trading volume. Sun, on secondary markets ‘generated proceeds of (\~$31M) from illegal, unregistered offers and sales of the token.’ Following the charges, Sun [responded](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1638742625003130881) via Twitter that:

>""We believe the complaint lacks merit, and in the meantime will continue building the most decentralized financial system.""

Tron was launched in 2018, and despite the network achieving success on some fronts, such as [hosting](https://tether.to/en/transparency/) 55% of USDt tokens, the network has often been criticized for copying new crypto trends. For instance, the network’s algorithmic stablecoin USDD was seen as attempting to replicate the UST stablecoin on the Luna network. Tron itself is often [described](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/04/revolution-promised-by-trons-justin-sun-looks-like-clone-of-terras-algorithmic-stablecoin/) as a copy of Ethereum with limited changes.

TRX sold off as much as 12% following the SEC announcing the charges. The token currently has a market cap of USD 5.72B. In regards to US trading venues, TRX is not supported on Coinbase, but is offered on Kraken.

**Takeaway:** In many ways, Tron and TRX represent a relatively typical example of a cryptocurrency and associated network: TRX was launched via an ICO in 2017 which raised USD 70M; Tron is supported via the efforts of the Tron Foundation, other entities, and Sun; the Tron network claims to be decentralized and not dependent on any one group. In this context, the charges highlight the extent of regulatory and legal complexity faced by the crypto space.",21,2023-03-26 22:58:16,70

&#x200B;

As you can see, there's just under $100 million Tether now on the Tron blockchain. Oh and I'm pretty sure there were a bunch of Tether recently printed on the Ethereum blockchain in the last few days. Don't remember seeing those numbers so high.

&#x200B;

The Tether printing machine is in full force across three different blockchains. Combined with the exodus of funds from Bitfinex, this is going to get ugly really fast.

&#x200B;

Everyone suspected that there were problems with Tether, but have continually ignored it. Same thing happened with Gox. Everyone knew, but hell didn't break loose until it was official.

&#x200B;

Tether is so ingrained into the crypto ecosystem, do we have any idea of the ramifications?

TRX,cryptocurrency,"Happy belated 20th Birthday to BitTorrent protocol, originally authored by Bram Cohen. You have changed the world forever, and gave us an early glimpse of a decentralized future. It's a shame how Justin is absolutely destroying the project.","On behalf of everyone born long ago enough to remember the struggles of taking 4 hours to download a song, sending an email through a CLI, to those with memories of yelling at their parents to get off the phone before being disconnected from Brood War, to those who have had the guilty pleasure of making a very flashy and pointless GeoCities webpage, and those who will forever have the ""You've got mail"" audio clip forever engrained in their memories, **thank you for all the being the first pioneers.**

To those who have been sued and fined ridiculous amounts of dollars, those who spent prison time for innovating, and to those who continue to fight for decentralization, **thank you.**

And on behalf of the seemingly few left in the world that actually cares about your past work, we sincerely apologize for the failure of Justin, Tron, and the ""new BTT team's"" utter disrespect and lack of care for the continued improvement of the BT protocol. This apology extends to the IPFS team as well. It just utterly blows my mind that a project literally forks every repo from a non-tokenized, open-source and non-profit organization, then continues to talk them down and give them shit because BTFS has ""more users.""

Since the acquisition of BitTorrent, Inc. (do not confuse this with the BitTorrent protocol):

* There have been zero protocol level improvements to BitTorrent clients nor uTorrent. I've spent countless hours reverse engineering BT/UT (BitTorrent / uTorrent) in search of  something, *anything.* But the deeper I looked, the sadder I got.
* The BT and UT clients have forcibly been closed source. Along with it, much of the original devs ongoing projects and plans were put to halt and presumably told to take down. If you look through GitHub and old forum posts, you'll see a lot of activity on BT/UT development, including user-submitted plugins and improvements. They all abruptly halted around 2018-2019, with Justin going as far as even removing some functionality that allowed for client enhancements.
* For a long time I was under the impression that the Tron/BTT team pioneered a way to allow P2P token transfers through torrent seeding, so I cut them a little slack for the lack of any activity on the BT/UT development end. Oh boy was I wrong. The BTT Speed bidding system was just BEP10 (Extension Protocol authored by Arvid Norberg of libtorrent in collaboration with UT). The BTTT team simply added a wallet on top of it, added it as a plugin on top of BT/UT, and pushed a WebUI with the most minimal, useless features that do not even record accurate data.
* BT/UT has been completely close-sourced, which I am sure they are regretting. It makes perfect sense why the BTT Speed wallet exchange has been down for 60 days now, after what was supposed to be a 2-hour maintenance. It's cause they didn't write the m'fkin protocol, and now the one or two devs working on BTT Speed are completely flabbergasted  which led to an emergency multiple job-listing posts days after they realized they were fucked.
* They forked almost every single IPFS repo's on GitHub (seriously, go check), implemented their minor changes, and now is the biggest shit talker on IPFS. You know what we called people doing shit like this back in the day? Script-kiddies.
* BTT is not some small project with big ambitions. It's a billion dollar market cap project. They raised $7.1mil through the ICO. And what do they have to show for it? Zero improvements in the clients (the community literally had to modify the client to unlock the 32-bit restriction as they are still stuck in 2012 and don't have a 64-bit version -- it'd take a day or two to release a 64-bit even if through LAA flag), a marketing team that posts cool images on Behance from time to time, a 24/7 twitter meme poster, and a bunch of forked codes. Where did the $7.1mil go? Definitely not development. Maybe a fancy office in SF? Or a fancy dinner with Warren Buffet? This is almost criminal.",3131,2021-07-15 13:03:37,502
