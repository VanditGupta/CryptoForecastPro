ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano Surges 86% in 7 Days as Retail FOMO Returns — $3 ADA All-Time High Coming?,,458,2024-11-11 07:06:53,122
ADA,cryptocurrency,Are you optimistic about Cardano?,"Cardano is currently in Epoch 500 which means 2500 consecutive days of no downtime. Quite the achievement. In a way, cardano has proven to withstand the test of time as it is still in the top 10 of cryptocurrencies ranked by marketcap. (As of now... It changes regularly on coinmarketcap)     It is currently preparing the launch of the Chang Hardfork in the coming days. An exciting update, which enables full community governance. The devs show no signs of slowing down, there are new projects launching regularly and soon you can even play Doom on cardano.    But the lack of liquidity and volume is still a problem, even tho it has been growing during the bearmarket.  So I am wondering what you think about it and what you are going to do. Do you just hodl and wait to break even or are you still accumulating? A lot of people seem to have turned against ADA in this sub...",8,2024-08-06 21:58:37,145
ADA,cryptocurrency,Is Cardano a Dead Chain? ADA Analysis Suggests Network May Never Deliver on Potential,,130,2024-09-19 11:14:51,288

ADA,cryptocurrency,It’s been over 11 weeks and there are still no Cardano dapps,"Since my first post that was almost 11 weeks ago raising concerns about the “upcoming” dapps on Cardano, there have been no news on this.  I was not only personally insulted in PMs, called a FUDer and an liar by the vast majority of Cardano holders, but was also told that Cardano dapps would be running 1 week after Alonzo Fork and dexes like Sudaeswap and ERGO would be fully functional any “moment” after the Alonzo Fork.  So, are there any news about that?? Did the concurrency problem get resolved? If yes, why are there no functioning dexes on Cardano yet? Can someone from the Cardano community enlighten us please?",5971,2021-11-24 14:53:39,3015
ADA,cryptocurrency,"Cardano network clogged, Avalanche congested a while ago, Polygon almost stopped completely due to some flower picking game. Are these really going to work as an alternative to Ethereum with its high gas fees?","Before anyone goes nuclear I will say that ETH is too damn expensive. But are the alternatives really so much better?   Recent news about Cardano congestion shooting up around 90% and more, Polygon being borderline unresponsive during Sunflower popularity/incident, and AVAX fees getting sky high while network suffered congestion a few months ago.  If these networks had the Ethereum levels of activitynon them, they wouldnt hold for long. Cardano has a handful of dapps and its already clogged? Same with Polygon. 1 dapp putting whole network on stop is really not what people would expect of the so called ""next gen eth competitors.""  While I 100% agree that gas fees on Ethereum are absurd, I wonder if the alternatives that we have at the moment in top10 are going to solve that. All claim insane TPS and finality times, but when the shit gets real, the fees and network congestion go up to the sky.",4620,2022-01-27 16:14:15,2952
ADA,cryptocurrency,"For those of you who weren't here during the bear market, Cardano dumped from above $1 to $0.03 and no one talked about it because they had delivered nothing but empty promises for 3 years despite intense marketing and hundreds of millions of dollars in funding. Do you really think anything changed?","The main focus throughout the bear market was the development of the Ethereum ecosystem. That is why the most popular dApps are all currently comfortably situated on the Ethereum main network. Yes, Ethereum's price dumped during the bear market as well, but the OGs in the space and all of the developers kept their eyes laser focused on the development happening within the Ethereum ecosystem.  I personally believe there are several solid alternatives to Ethereum (Polygon, Avalanche, Solana), but unless such networks have built a bridge to Ethereum, they likely will not survive. That is why all of the chains I mentioned were forced to develop bridges to Ethereum because no developer in their right mind would leave the Ethereum ecosystem for a risky sidechain or other layer 1 network. I do not think Cardano will be any different, but this is just my opinion.  Unless someone can tell me otherwise, I am not aware of any actively used dApp that has committed to migrating from other chains to Cardano. Unless you see the likes of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, Synthetix, USDC, and Yearn talk about migrating to Cardano, there really isn't anything to talk about with regard to ""Cardano killing Ethereum"". Hint: they'll never migrate.  I'm posting this because I'm getting sick of the manic Cardano threads where bagholders are desperately trying to get others to buy so the price goes higher and they can sell. Yes, they are scheduled to release smart contracts soon, but the biggest question remains, ***who is going to use their platform***? I have seen extraordinarily innovative developments being made on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and those did not happen overnight and it's hard to imagine people just packing up their bags and leaving to work on Cardano.  To all of the people about to yell at me for making another ""Cardano is overhyped post"" I want you to take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror: have you ever actually *used* Ethereum? Polygon? Avalanche? Solana? Have you ever actually *used* a decentralized exchange, lending protocol, NFT marketplace/game, or provided liquidity to these networks? I have. I've done all of it. So do you really have the perspective to be arguing about ""Ethereum killers"" and how ""great"" Cardano will be when you don't even have experience with engaging and interacting with smart contracts?  Where is all of your hype really coming from, the echo chambers on Twitter and Reddit? I'm asking because I fell for the same ""academic scientific approach"" marketing in 2017 and it's just the same cycle over and over again - Cardano is great at making money during bull markets, but not very good at delivering promised products, but I really hope I'm wrong this time.  !remindme 8 months  EDIT: Maybe some users in the comment section can look at one another and realize that there is not a single rebuttal to my points (removed technical because one user is right, I didn't really provide ""technical"" arguments). Every post is about price action. Will Cardano potentially make you some money this bull run? Sure, that is, if you aren't stuck holding bags while everyone sells the top. But please, let's stay on topic. Present some counterarguments related to the actual utility of the network.  EDIT 2: People should be aware that there was very similar hype surrounding Cardano leading up to the Coinbase [listing date](https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-launching-on-coinbase-pro-694b1cb8c778?gi=2495f7011d1c) (March 16-18), and the hype pump peaked at 1.38 (ATH at the time) on March 17, dumped to 1.24 (-10%) by March 18, and continued to dump to 1.06 (-25%) by March 24. Sure, it kept going up, and we may see a similar ""pump, dump, pump"" related to the smart contract release, but the ""pump"" following the ""dump"" all depends on execution and whether people actually care to use Cardano's platform.  EDIT 3: Thanks to a great comment by u/BornToBeHwild, I learned that Cardano is already developing and supporting an Ethereum bridge ([https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/)), which proves my point entirely - Cardano won't ""kill everything in this space"", they are already building measures to integrate with the existing ecosystem and adapt, so maybe it's time to stop saying it will end all of the progress that has already been made in decentralized finance and media and take over the world.  EDIT 4: I realize that my post is very triggering and I will edit the language a bit to emphasize the points I'm trying to make and remove some of the more triggering elements. Sometimes you forget in all of the mania that people have money at stake and I by no means am trying to ""FUD"" Cardano. I have friends and family who own this coin and I actually like Charles as he introduced me to a lot of the concepts I learned about in this space through his videos and lectures. I hope Cardano succeeds.  The point of my post was that people need to understand there already a ton of great, functioning products out there that all promised similar ""Ethereum killing"" capabilities that ultimately had to adapt and integrate with Ethereum in order to remain relevant and I do not think Cardano will be any different (see EDIT 3). Just trying to set expectations, especially for newcomers who are probably feeling FOMO for Cardano and are tempted to buy it while it's up x2 it's 2017 ATH and at the peak of its bull run. I'm not saying it won't go higher, but I do think the mania can be harmful for people who are just getting into the space now.  EDIT 5: I want to bring attention to a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vgije?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in this thread made by u/Bwahehe, which is not getting enough upvotes and perfectly articulates the point I am getting across:  >ETH is like Manhattan. Horribly crowded with insane traffic, but they're doing a ton of business.   >   >Cardano is like someone selling a potentially lucrative spot of land but absolutely no businesses are there yet. They promise that they'll finish the roads in a month or two but they'll be some damn amazing and scientifically proven roads.   >   >Most up and coming smart contract coins promise massive highways and roads but nobody knows if the roads and bridges are really safe to drive on and only hydrogen powered vehicles approved by them are allowed on the roads.  EDIT 6: I'm trying to respond to everyone but this is exploding... Also, I keep getting accused of ""missing"" Cardano or ""buying it high"" or something. Guys, look at my username. [I'm all about The Graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owryqy/why_the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/) (GRT).  EDIT 7: I've been reading more and being a bit more selective about commenting back since there are just too many to keep up with and every time I refresh there's 50 more, but I'm really happy to see that the comments have shifted from price to actual discussion. Great to see! This is what r/CryptoCurrency should be all about! I like ADA, I like Charles, I want it to succeed for reasons I mentioned above.  This isn't meant to be a tribalistic war-igniting trigger post. I just think it's time to have real discussion on this sub and Cardano is the hottest topic because it is leading the bullrun in gains. Stop getting so bent out of shape, my post is not going to cause Cardano to dump, nor is it an attempt to provoke a dump. I think this is a great place for newcomers and old schoolers to join one another and discuss what they know. It's also a great opportunity for Cardano followers and supporters to counter my arguments and present their points and why they believe in the project - remember, I have not really kept up with Cardano since 2017, so I can totally be wrong about a lot of things and I accept that! The point is, this thread was a success because it reminded thousands of users here that we can still engage in high level discussions and not everything has to be about price and driving lambo rockets to the moon.  Just want to thank a few posters for their great comments including  u/orangeblack07 ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vtoat?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/todayismycheatday ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vsq6t/?context=3)), u/cali_dave ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vogw9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/OhIamNotADoctor ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vnxer?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). There are so many great comments, but as you can imagine, my inbox is absolutely obliterated and I need to go to sleep lol, so give these guys the upvotes they deserve!  EDIT 8: Last edit (I hope). Some great discussion ultimately ensued and I appreciate everyone who made thoughtful posts. I definitely don't appreciate the attacks on my character and assumptions about who I am as a person, but I guess that's part of making controversial posts like this. Had no idea it would blow up so much and did my best to answer as many comments as I can. I really hope everyone knows that I do like ADA, I do like Charles, and I hope Cardano succeeds (though I think I've already mentioned this in another of my 45 edits). I was just hoping to stimulate some actual discussion on a subreddit that is in dire need of it. Thanks for engaging me. Till next time!  EDIT 14: Lots of great comments actually made me realize I don't know the first thing about what is going on with Cardano at this point in time, I'm not ashamed to admit it. There's a lot more going on than I thought there was! I listed some of the good comments that pointed me in the right direction above in EDIT 6. Maybe I'm wrong about Cardano, maybe the slow and steady wins the race philosophy will prevail! Who knows. I'm just glad that there were so many newly introduced perspectives in this thread hidden between the shill and anti-graph\_marine brigading. I'll be eagerly awaiting the launch of their smart contract platform and dApps so that I can dabble with them myself.  Thanks again to everyone who provided quality discussion and also to anyone who gave me awards, you really didn't have to do that!  tl;dr (for those who want one) - Cardano has taken a very long time to release a product while others have thrived. People only seem to talk about Cardano during bull markets when the price is going up and I want to have a discussion about how people can think it is the end-all-be-all smart contract platform when it still doesn't have a working product. Discussion ensues. Some posters create great counter arguments and provoke thoughtful discussion while others brigade me with hateful spam.",5995,2021-08-22 04:03:49,2317

ADA,cryptocurrency,Charles from cardano was right. You need ripple to win or this lawsuit. The SEC is going to open up CoinMarketCap and start litigating down the list. Do not let tribalism get in the way of this.,"By winning the suit against ripple and the execs (for anyone who’s been following the suit ripple are absolutely smashing it) there will be case precedent.   They will have the big fish and case law.  This means any ico or sale of crypto from the inventors of said crypto will be targeted. There’s one thing the SEC likes and that is money.   They can see an untapped wealth of fines and settlements here and they want to be the regulator who controls crypto in the USA.

ADA,cryptocurrency,The fact that Cardano was in 3rd place without smart contracts proves how much this market is driven by hype.,"No I’m not here to sh#t on Cardano, I’m just trying to show how much hype is important in this market.  At some point in time, Cardano was 3rd place in market capitalization behind Ethereum and Bitcoin, yet it still didn’t even have smart contracts compared to Ethereum which already had them perfected a long beforehand.  I like Cardano a lot don’t get me wrong, butI just feel like they’re very slow with development especially compared to other chains like Polygon for example.  If anything, Polygon is WAY younger than Cardano yet it still managed to get 7000+ fully functioning dApps on board a lot of which are of very high quality actually. And quiet honestly, I think a project like Polygon is more deserving of slot at the top.  Cardano has **A LOT** of potential if only they improve their development timing. But for the current performance, I just think they’re very overhyped. That’s just my personal take though.",2052,2022-03-10 17:24:33,869

This speculation will still have too much volume for a crypto ""just"" adopting smart contracts.   Smart contracts is a feature many other cryptocurrencies have while being fast and not taking much fees (XLM). The speculation acts like Cardano would adopt a ground breaking never seen before innovation, even while it is considered a more basic feature by some people by now.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Why do people think that Cardano is faster than Ethereum?,"OK can we please have a technical discussion regarding the scalability of Cardano? Instead of the regular super highly upvoted moontalk (I know this thread will probably be downvoted to oblivion).  Cardano currently only handles 7 transactions per second on-chain. Ethereum currently handles 12-15 transactions per second on-chain. By tweaking some parameters in the future Cardano could potentially scale to 50 transactions per second on-chain which obviously still isn't enough for real world adoption. Cardano will scale off-chain with layer 2 solutions (Hydra). But they are awfully behind their competition in developing layer 2 support.  Don't take my word for it, even Cardano devs on their own subreddit admit all this.  See here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mxjf0w/psa\_cardano\_ada\_runs\_at\_seven\_7\_transactions\_per/](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mxjf0w/psa_cardano_ada_runs_at_seven_7_transactions_per/)  And here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/Cardano\_ELI5/comments/la7ptu/how\_many\_transactions\_per\_second\_tps\_can\_cardano/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/la7ptu/how_many_transactions_per_second_tps_can_cardano/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)  So why do so many people think that Cardano is faster than Ethereum?  Also, I made this same post intended to discuss the scalability of Cardano two days ago. It quickly rose into the top 50 posts until a bot deleted it from the frontpage stating ""there are already 2 posts about this coin in the top 50"". But guess what, there are always 2 non-critical moonboy posts about Cardano in the top 50. So it's very unfortunate that technical discussions about this coin have no place on [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/). I will therefore keep posting this daily, until the day a bot doesn't delete it.  Edit: Since this time, this post didn't get deleted, I will add this. I have nothing against Cardano. But I have noted that there currently exists a widespread lack of knowledge regarding the scalability of blockchains in general and Cardano in particular. This is an extremely hard technical problem that haven't been solved for over 10 years. Cardano is not offering a unique quick fix to this anytime in the near future. But I am happy that we now have more projects than ever (including Cardano) that are working on it.",2112,2021-05-30 23:49:00,925

ADA,cryptocurrency,12 reasons Cardano can't scale in 2022,"This post is a reality check on IOHK's latest investor disinformation campaign: https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/01/14/how-we-re-scaling-cardano-in-2022/  Tldr: It's great to see they are starting to acknowledge Cardano's scalability problem, or at least pumping the brakes on their unsubstantiated claims of having solved the trilemma. For the first time, 2021 saw the Cardano community publicly acknowledge some of the limitations of their design that critics have pointed out for years. We've come a long way since IOHK was still pretending this was almost ready to go: https://nitter.net/iohk_charles/status/1287481374224420864  **1. BLOCK SIZE/ 2. MEMORY/ 3. STORAGE INCREASES**  The bigger the blocks, the higher the memory, and the more storage- the faster the chain. Basically every chain that isn't already run on super computers can increase blocksizes, memory or storage requirements if they are OK with more centralization and less stability. That's the trade off. That's true for Cardano, and it's true for every other chain.   But how much room does Cardano have to increase parameters? Cardano already has pretty much the same blocksize as Ethereum (72Kb vs ETH's average of 80Kb) and dramatic increases in blocksize will decrease the number of people who can afford to run nodes, and it also makes the network more likely to fork. The theoretical max limit is 28x the current blocksize, but that is almost certainly not practically possible, and no one supports increasing it to even half of that (which is about the most that has ever been tested), because increasing the blocksize isn't free. How critical is it for Cardano to maintain as small of blocksizes as possible?   Critical enough that the plan is to only increase in 12.5% intervals when absolutely necessary. The fact that anyone is at all hesitant to increase Cardano's limit when it's 72kb tells you that this isn't a free trade. There is no plan to ever reach max parameters. Edit: they can actually increase the block size OR decrease the block time, but as they both directly factor into block propagation times, either choice produces the same throughput limit. The decision has more to do with which hardware requirements you want to increase.  https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/pf25jk/without_hydra_cardano_probably_wont_be_faster/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share  What makes Cardano fundamentally slower than every other chain is how bloated their tx sizes are. We've all heard the sales pitch ""And Cardano has native tokens that don't need smart contracts!,"" but what you didn't get told is that native UTXO txs on Cardano are an average of 500 bytes WITHOUT smart contracts. And that a basic, native tx is larger than the average Ethereum tx WITH smart contracts.   And no, the ""And Cardano can combine 20 txs into 1 !"" meme doesn't make any difference. The size and speed of each block is all the same regardless of whether you call it 1 tx or 20tx's. The only thing combining txs does is make Cardano significantly cheaper to DDOS.   https://messari.io/asset/ethereum/metrics/network-activity  Native Cardano UTXOs are bigger than the average Ethereum tx, and Plutus smart contracts txs are even bigger that - a lot bigger- like 40x the size of Ethereum smart contracts:  **Sundaeswap determined that the Cardano network was their primary bottle neck and measured Cardano's real-world throughput for their smart contracts to be 0.15 TPS.** That's 47x slower than a native UTXO on Cardano, 100x slower than an Ethereum tx, and 66,000x slower than a Cosmos and Terra tx. 0.15 TPS is a max of 12,960 txs per day, under ideal conditions... on the entire Cardano chain.   https://sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/expectations-congestion-mainnet-launch-e9da5abfd819  Edit: Sunday swaps medium posts are all offline now.  https://web.archive.org/web/20220117005224/https://sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/expectations-congestion-mainnet-launch-e9da5abfd819  Cardano's problem is much bigger than anything that can be fixed with a 2x parameter adjustment. Max parameters will never be implemented, and even then, they would still leave Cardano more than 3x slower than the second slowest L1 chain, Ethereum.    **4. Pipe Lining and 5. Input Endorsers**  ...are great ideas. So why are these still in the research phase? They're promising to deliver a plan that hasn't even been designed yet. Let's assume these get designed and developed in 2022. Then Cardano is in the ballpark of Ethereum L1's low tps and high congestion.   **6. Plutus Script Enhancements**  These are basic functions (that are still in the research phase because of how they conflict with provability in Hydra). Plutus should not even have been released before they developed reference and data inputs. That was an obvious problem, and it was a huge mistake that will create chaos and disappointment.   Edit: putting something as basic and critical as reference inputs on the roadmap for 9 months after smart contracts are released is the definition of ""move fast and break things."" Also, nobody has explained how they solved the conflict with provability. They didn't leave it out of Plutus because it's a minor problem: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3dc6zG9EjWE&t=37m30s  Cardano will alway have much larger txs than non-UTXO chains because native UTXOs are so large. On top of that, Plutus' smart contract implementation is extremely bloated and inefficient. The problem is that Cardano's UTXO model can't store smart contracts on-chain. So instead of calling an on-chain smart contract, every Cardano SC tx must include the SC script in every tx, because there is no on-chain SC that can simply be referenced again and again. This makes every Cardano smart contract very large.   Cardano currently does native asset txs (without smart contracts) at 7 TPS, and that's the theoretical minimum SC size, if they figure out how to compress SCs 47x. And that means that Cardano SCs will always be at least twice as slow as Ethereum L1's unbearably slow 15 TPS, for the same blocksize.   Now is a good time to point out that it's clear from their rhetorical focus of comparing their chain to the next slowest chain, that Cardano holders have no idea how slow Ethereum is. Up to this point in time, almost all of Cardano's txs have been basic UTXO's that haven't filled up blocks, because they are a small fraction of the size of smart contracts.   Four months after going live, no one really uses smart contracts on Cardano yet. Muesliswap doesn't even have $100 Million in TVL (and doesn't have $5M in liquidity to other tokens). Small NFT drops did bring the network to a crawl, but we haven't seen speeds across the whole network change dramatically like they will when Sundaeswap launches a real DEX and much bigger txs flood the chain Thursday.   And catching up to Ethereum L1 will not be good enough. Ethereum has L2s already, and nobody would use Eth L1 if it went live for the first time today. Ethereum has the first mover advantage of having all the liquidity. Whales don't care about a $200 fee, they care about liquidity. They need to move in and out of large positions quickly with as little price impact and slippage as possible.    **7. Node Enhancements**  This is not a scaling solution. Yes, fix your bugs and optimize your code. No other chain thinks a node update is a ""scaling solution."" This is ridiculous. Let me say this again: Cardano is currently 66,000x slower than Cosmos and Terra.  **8. Side-chains**  Great idea. But Cardano doesn't have any decentralized side-chains, and they didn't even get serious about funding any until late last summer. Proper sidechains are the real solution. Milkomeda is on the right track with their M1 sidechain. It's an accounts model Solidity EVM sidechain that has 32 permissioned nodes and uses slashing. Congratulations on abandoning all of your stated goals, and rushing to produce something usable. We waited six years so Catalyst could fund BSC 2.0.  https://dcspark.gitbook.io/milkomeda/our-solution-1/the-m-1-sidechain  **9. Hydra**  A comprehensive plan for interhead Hydra implementation that approaches anything close to a generalized L2 has yet to be described, let alone developed. We're still waiting for a basic description of how isomorphic state channels will ever scale dApps or have any use between untrusted parties. Hydra's 2022 release schedule is for payment channels between trusted parties. Yes, it will be able to handle smart contracts, but not any smart contracts that dApps use. Hydra heads have to be closed every time a party joins or leaves, and they have no known application for dApps. Hydra is really irrelevant, because native UTXO transfers aren't the problem right now.   https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/s18wie/should_cardano_be_prepared_to_abandon_hydra/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share  **10. Off-chain computing**  >""Transactions occur outside of the blockchain itself, yet can offer fast, cheap transactions via a trust model.""  Brilliant. This is a creative solution. Off-chain **trusted** computations. *Finally something that makes sense.* Yes, Cardano users should definitely do their computations somewhere they trust, off-chain... Muhammad Fucking Christ. Let me suggest they do their computations on one of the 79 other L1 blockchains.  Edit: there's a massive difference between off-chain to a trusted party and off-chain to decentralized, trustless rollup or side chain. They are not remotely the same. That's why Sundaeswap had to come up with the convoluted scooper model and Maladex wrote a book detailing their experimental solution to countering the specific vulnerabilities of off-chain code (some of which on-chain verification will never detect). In the YouTube link above, Sebastien from DC Spark says Cardano is years away from having rollups.   **11. Mithril**  >To achieve greater scalability, you need to address the complexity of critical operations that depend logarithmically on the number of participants.    What? This is straight gibberish. Mithril is obviously not a relevant scaling solution. Mithril is a solution to a problem that many other chains don't even have. Even Ethereum can run a trustless lite client for nodes. Wtf does that have to do with how slow Cardano SCs are? Light client nodes don't write blocks in Cardano. Your inability to figure out a trustless lite client is irrelevant right now.   **12. Fees**  The short term consequence of Sundaeswap's launch will be a DDOS attack. Txs across the entire Cardano network will take days to process. I predict that Sundaeswap will be forced to throttle their volume, so that the rest of the chain is usable. Best case scenario for EOY 2022, Cardano users can expect Ethereum L1 tx speeds, if everything goes right.  And Cardano has another problem they still haven't solved that Ethereum doesn't have. Slow blockchains require high fees, and Cardano doesn't have dynamic fees. Price fixing always creates shortages. They need dynamic fees. There's no way around supply and demand. Everyone has been saying Cardano's fee model wouldn't work for years. IOHK is just now taking the question seriously, and their recent moves on fees makes it clear that they have no idea what they are doing.   People don't pay fees for fun. The fees are the only thing that make Ethereum usable. You can underpay gas on Ethereum and wait days for the tx to go through if you want, but you can't manage Defi positions or even use a DEX without cutting in line to get immediate settlement.   It doesn't matter that txs have a deterministic order. The Cardano chain can't compute every tx (off-chain) and magically update price feeds with future prices, before the blocks are written. Even on Ethereum txs frequently fall outside of reasonable slippage in minutes. The slippage required to guarantee a tx over 24 hrs would regularly be a double digit percentage of the trade amount. And high slippage is especially a vulnerability for Cardano because so many dApps feature some risk of trusted party ordering. Low slippage is a protection against that.  Also, fees are how slow chains keep from getting Ddos attacked (RIP🏴‍☠️ NANO). If less than 13k txs take 24 hours to clear, anyone can completely stop all traffic on the Cardano network for the cost of 13k txs. And they can render it functionally unusable for a fraction of that. The Cardano community has only recently begun to admit that priority fees will be necessary, and their plans for tiered fees are poorly thought out. Search their sub for ""fees"" and read them blindly trying to reinvent the wheel. This is basic economics, and they have done no real research on it.   For years we were told that the whole point of Cardano was to avoid launching broken products like this. Cardano's reputation will never recover from this ""Move slow and break things"" for a food DEX (that originally chose to launch on BSC).   ADA was worth more in 2018 than it was worth during its dip last week. What coin do you think ADA holders will have to sell to buy the other half of liquidity pairs to earn rewards on these DEXs? 🤔  Cardano has not been waiting to release better designed, more secure products. Txs that take days was not part of the 4d chess plan. Look at Sundaeswap's audit and the Plutus exploit. It's the same stuff we see on other chains, plus slow txs, plus trusted off-chain elements, plus a roadmap that is critically reliant on problems that are unsolved.   None of these problems are going away in weeks. The problem with Cardano is the complete lack of honesty from leaders and influencers like Charles Hoskinson, who regularly makes false claims, and a culture of over optimism and anti-critical thinking. Their plan isn't going well, and their jobs rely on them not admitting it.",1237,2022-01-19 12:56:04,1513

ADA,cryptocurrency,CARDANO's strategy TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD BY 2025 has been right in front of your very eyes: an overview of what's to come in 2022 + why Africa is the key!,"I'll start with what's to come for 2022 and then move to Africa. A series of fortunate events leading to vision 2025. All info is widely available and verifiable. Sources and links given below.  Ecosystem growth in 2022:  1. [10+ DEXes](https://twitter.com/cardano_whale/status/1465907181086130179)**, built from ground up**, that will specifically use the advantage of the extended UTxO model. Note the emphasizes on ""built from ground up"" meaning that [they will be different from what you're used from the Dapps on the account-based model blockchains.](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/16/architecting-dapps-on-the-eutxo-ledger/)  Benchmarking shows that with the eUTXO model, [around 25 to 30 orders can be easily handled within one single transaction.](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1475523126343741448) 2. **Borrow and lending protocols + robust DeFI ecosystem dropping in Q1/Q2 '22** after auditing and testing on testnet. Remember that it took Ethereum 2.5 years to have cryptokitties and Solana over more than a year to have some decent DApps. Cardano entered the smart contract era on 9 September 2021 so Q1/Q2 is pretty damn fast and it's gonna give a shockwave to the entire ecosystem not to mention **biggest ADA supply crunch once DExes are running at full speed**. As the DeFi ecosystem starts to take off, an alliance was announced to help speed it on its way through  standardisation and best practice -> [Cardano DeFi Alliance](https://cardanodefialliance.org/). 3. [DJED](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/18/djed-implementing-algorithmic-stablecoins-for-proven-price-stability/):  **a crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin contract that acts as an autonomous bank**. I can't stress the importance of this enough. **Djed is the** ***first*** **coin to use formal verification to eliminate price volatility.**  The first implementation of a Djed stablecoin contract was [SigmaUSD](https://sigmausd.io/#/) on Ergo. 4. [**Hydra**](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/17/hydra-cardano-s-solution-for-ultimate-scalability/) **is Cardano's solution to ultimate layer 2 scalability** that aims to maximize throughput, minimize latency,  incurring low to no costs, and greatly reducing storage requirements.  Hydra introduces the concept of [isomorphic state channels](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/299.pdf):  that is, to reuse **the same ledger representation to yield uniform,  off-chain ledger siblings, which we call Heads** (hence the Hydra name,  which references the [mythological, multi-headed creature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra)).  Specifically for Cardano, this means that native assets, non-fungible  tokens (NFTs), and Plutus scripting are available inside *each* Hydra Head.  **Many  of the transactions currently handled by the main-chain or application  running on the main chain can benefit directly from Hydra, because it  understands just the same transaction formats and signatures.**  In a layer 2 system like Hydra, it is possible to achieve **confirmation times of** ***less than one second***. Throughput measured in TPS per Hydra head is mostly limited by the available hardware. In principle, **by adding increasing  numbers of Hydra heads to the system, arbitrarily high throughput can be  achieved by the system as a whole**. ( e.g. each stake pool on Cardano could achieve about 1000 TPS there are over 3000+ stake pools on Cardano right now so when implemented you could in theory achieve 3M+ TPS = 1000 TPS/stake pool \* 3000+ stake pools) 5. [Babel fees](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/25/babel-fees/) =  **being able to pay transaction fees in custom currencies! Potential to bring all ERC-20 tokens to Cardano** for obvious reasons ([see converter in action here](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/12/07/the-agix-erc20-converter-testnet-is-now-live/))... First, let us recall how **native assets** work in Cardano: Tokens can be created according to a minting policy and they **are treated natively in the ledger along with ada**. **Cardano's ledger adopts the  Extended UTXO (EUTXO) model**, and issuing a valid transaction requires consuming one or more UTXOs. A **UTXO  in Cardano may carry not just ada but in fact a token bundle that can  contain multiple different tokens,  both fungible and non-fungible**. In this way **it is possible to write  transactions that transfer multiple different tokens with a single  UTXO.** **Transaction fees in the ledger are denominated in ada according to a function fixed as a ledger parameter**. A powerful feature of Cardano's EUTXO model is that the **fees** required for a valid  transaction **can  be predicted precisely prior to posting it. This is a  unique feature  that is not enjoyed by other ledger arrangements (such as  the  account-based model used in Ethereum)**. Indeed, in this latter  case  the fees needed for a transaction may change during the time it  takes  for the transaction to settle, since other transactions may  affect the  ledger's state in between and influence the required cost  for processing  the transaction."" 6. [**NFTs are booming**](https://opencnft.io/marketplace) and yet you only hear about ETH/SOL NFT stuff. **106M ADA traded over 9 NFT marketplaces in just 6 months!!** I expect 2022 to be a game changer when it comes to **GamiFi, DeFi and RealFi which will lead (did I mention this already :)?) to the the biggest supply crunch of ADA** since Cardano's inception.  **This means that anyone can mint their own tokens, including  non-fungible tokens (NFTs) without needing a smart contract.** 7. The first stage of the **Voltaire** era aka **Project Catalyst:** which is the **biggest decentralized fund (any chain)** right now! It has over **700 million ADA and it's used to fund all kind of projects** including some of the DEXes, NFT marketplaces, and other lending protocols mentioned above. **That's approx. 1 billion $** in our war chest to fund the devs on Cardano and create their DApps and other products. It's been successfully active for almost a year now. 8. [**Mithril**](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/29/mithril-a-stronger-and-lighter-blockchain-for-better-efficiency/) boosts the efficiency of *full node clients* or applications.  It ensures **fast and secure synchronization of the full node data,  significantly improving time and required resources including  computation, network exchange, and local storage while keeping  high-level security guarantees.** Mithril is also applicable to *light clients and mobile applications*, ensuring a trustless approach. **Another significant advantage is using Mithril signatures for running** ***sidechains***\*\*.  The main blockchain can connect to **different sidechains that can even  have different consensus protocols**. Mithril has benefits in lightweight  blockchain state verification, and thus, certificates can validate the  current state of the specific blockchain as well as the correctness of  forward and backward transfers in a secure way. Finally,  stake-based voting applications and governance solutions can use Mithril  regardless of the voting protocol’s complexity. Mithril signatures can  be utilized for secure and lightweight tally verification. This is also  useful in governance when stakeholders go through a decentralized  decision-making process and provide the final result in an easy and  verifiable way. 9. So, **sidechains and different consensus protocols you say**? Yessir, that's called **Basho** phase on Cardano. There's another cool thing from dcSpark called [Milkomeda](https://dcspark.gitbook.io/milkomeda/):  **Milkomeda will launch in both of these ecosystems (Solana & Cardano) and deploy EVM-based sidechains for each. This will aid them in acquiring existing Solidity developers out there who are interested in building dApps for whole new user bases.** With a first mover advantage for sidechains on both chains, expect to ride the initial wave of excitement and build a protocol that makes a difference and lasts.  **Now AFRICA!**  [Try to watch this short video](https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/rekl92/africa_and_the_world_has_crypto_the_answer/) to understand why they are the key and why Cardano team has been over there for almost 5 years now.

[Source](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/26/africa-is-where-the-tough-get-going/): Why Africa?  If the whole world is globalizing and changing, you want to be  where all the systems are going to change first, because if you get it  right, **more wealth will be created here over the next three decades than  in Europe, the United States and China combined.** That’s just how it is.  It’s why the US got on top in the 20th century. It just simply had a  better system than the competitors. And everything resets when you have  technological change. **We now live in a global economy. People from  Africa are going to be on equal footing with people in Europe and  America if we do things the right way. And then it’s a meritocratic  race, and I’m going to bet on the people who are tougher, more resilient  and more entrepreneurial 10 out of 10 times. They’re going to win –  it’s just that simple.**   So IOG has a pan-African view as a company. We started in a pretty  difficult country to do business in, Ethiopia, and you know what?  **Everywhere we looked, we saw well-educated, well-intentioned people who  really did want change. And they worked with us. Sometimes the system  worked against us; sometimes it worked with us. But everybody remembered  why they were there. And it was the privilege of my career to announce a  deal of five million people that could grow to 20 million, that could  grow to a national ID system of 110 million in just a few years, and  that could grow into a voting system, a payment settlement system.** It  can grow to anything. It’s kind of like the stem cell: once you’re in,  you’re in, and you can keep navigating and growing. And then how do we  take that to Kenya, to Nigeria? That’s 400 million people – more than  the population of the entire United States – within grasp in five to 10  years.  **What’s most extraordinary is that this will transform the lives of  people. Now, boring work has to be done, dry presentations given about  credential this and verification that. And they’re very necessary. But  at the core of all of that are people.**  6) [Crypto + identity solutions for Africa = RealFi:](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/25/welcome-to-the-age-of-realfi/)  By **integrating digital identity with Cardano, we can create real value and opportunity for people across the globe.**  Among nations with developed economic systems, **DeFi has  highlighted the potential for blockchain to disrupt financial ‘legacy’  systems and open up access to new users hunting for better yields and  moving liquidity** around. It has established an entirely new financial  paradigm and the **$100bn DeFi market is expected to grow significantly  over the next few years as models continue to evolve.**  However, as  much as the age of DeFi is creating fresh markets and driving  compelling new use cases, **it has also further highlighted the economic divide between people who can easily access financial products, and  those who cannot.**  **The reason why banks refuse credit or loans in emerging markets is  often that they don’t have enough data about the person or organization  intending to borrow.**  All the **necessary financial information can be stored and relayed  in a verifiable manner through an** [**Atala PRISM ID**](https://atalaprism.io/app)**.** The monetary building  bricks of DeFi can be used to structure these loans and hedge the  currency risk, while scalable payment rails provided by Cardano and  various layer 2 solutions will make it possible to transfer capital  across the world without friction.  [Atala Prism](https://www.atalaprism.io/)  is a **decentralized identity system that enables people to own their personal data and interact with organizations seamlessly, privately, and  securely. The Atala Prism team is integrating metadata to certify and  store DIDs and DID documents on Cardano.** Also, it will be possible not  only to create but also to revoke credentials such as university  certificates.  **Atala Trace and Atala Scan are being developed to  enable brand owners to improve the visibility over supply chain  processes and establish product provenance and auditability.** In these  cases, metadata integration will be used to record tamper-proof  supply-chain records.  **Cardano adds the final piece of the financial puzzle by unlocking real economic value at the end of the transaction chain:** ***personal identity...***  **Identity  is central to everything. Once someone has an economic identity, a  world of opportunity and inclusivity opens up. Real opportunity comes  with access to essential services that were hitherto out of reach. And  real finance, such as loans to open a business or maintain an existing  one. RealFi.**  **Identity can become an asset in so far as it can be a  substitute for collateral.** A lender's overriding concern is to ensure  that loans (plus any interest accrued) are paid back. One way of  enforcing this is by collateralizing the loan, but if the lender has  enough and clear information about a borrower (if they know the borrower  is a high-earner, or a long-standing customer), the lender might be  more inclined to forgo the collateral.  7) [connect the unconnected and bank the unbanked](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/11/connecting-the-unconnected-banking-the-unbanked/)  TL;DR: Cardano ecosystem to the moon in 2022! ;)  EDIT: I tried to post this yesterday on this sub but it was removed cause other 2 Cardano posts were in top 50...

My wife and I were DINK's for 10+ years, so we've always put the future & ourselves first.  It's been rough since our daughter was born and we wanted to provide an awesome Christmas for her this year, and selling our holdings was the only way.  I guess if there's something to ""learn"" here, is that regardless of how much we love the gains & holding through the storm, don't forget about your loved ones & the memories you could make with what you already have.  It's not always about the long game.  EDIT:  Thank you all for the responses, from all angles.  We have plenty in savings / investments / assets for the future, cashing out our crypto stake just made the most sense out of all options... so no, we didn't go from ""10+ year DINKs to broke in 18 months"".  We also understand an 18 month old wont remember this Christmas... obviously.  We just wanted to continue a happy foundation vs trying to scrape by the holidays with what we DO have.  Once again, thank you all for the different perspectives.",1172,2021-11-20 23:56:53,580

ADA,cryptocurrency,"This sub is bipolar as fuck about Cardano right now. You can just trust what random people on the internet say about Cardano, or...you could look at the data...","The posts on the front page about Cardano right now are bipolar as fuck. It's true...most people would probably agree that Cardano is one of the most divisive topics of discussion on this sub. I'll admit my bias for the project, but my opinions have not been formed based on rampant, baseless speculation. Let's look at the facts and the data. I believe I've been able to leave my bias out of most everything below...  &nbsp;  [Here is the Messari table for most active coins](https://messari.io/screener/most-active-chains-DB01F96B)  You can sort this table in all sorts of ways. As of today, if you sort by ""Real Volume"", ""Transaction Volume"", or ""Adjusted Transaction Volume"", you'd see Cardano ranked 3rd behind BTC and ETH. Now, some will refute this evidence of Cardano's utility by saying that Messari skews these numbers for UTxO platforms because of ""change"" UTxOs. Fair enough...let's sort by ""Active Addresses"" and we see Cardano ranked 4th at ~383k addresses, 80% of ETHs active addresses and about 42% of BTC...and this is without any DeFi projects having launched yet. You can see [here](https://messari.io/charts/cardano/act-addr-cnt) that is a growth of about 250% over the last week. TheDeFi project with the biggest reputation at this point, SundaeSwap, will most likely launch before the end of the year. People LOVE to measure the value of a chain based on TVL, which many Cardano bears will correctly state that there is currently zero TVL. Yeah, no shit...you can't measure something before it's been created. It's like trying to say somebody will be a shit athlete before they're even born, they have to at least grow to an age where they can start participating (analogies not always my strong suit, bare with me...). Anybody calling Cardano ""vaporware"" is lying, and anyone saying it ""has no dapps yet"" is not paying attention to the activity in the community and, while true at THIS VERY MOMENT, is basically ignoring the state of current DeFi projects. Ethereum took far longer than 11 weeks for good quality dapps to get going, Cardano will have them in about 4 months time from launch of smart contracts.  &nbsp;  Ok...so Cardano is being used A LOT right now...how is it handling the load? Well, you can see [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/p_59kxcdtwnc) that the blockchain load has been steadily increasing since October. And you can see [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/s0XCC) that the number of transactions is spiking greatly. (You can adjust the graphs to an earlier date to see that the trend is increasing but I can't link directly to it). Best thing about Cardano? It was built to BEND NOT BREAK!!! There are many parameters that can be adjusted on an epoch's notice to accommodate more transaction volume. In fact, [that is exactly what is being done](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/22/slow-and-steady-wins-the-race-network-evolution-for-network-growth/). At the moment this is controlled by IOG, but when we eventually get full on-chain governance we, the community, will be in control of how Cardano adapts.   &nbsp;  I'm hoping I've laid out the facts with evidence pretty clearly here and I think I've avoided bias. I'm not trying to convince anybody to buy or sell, I want everybody to make up their own minds based on the data. It's exactly what attracted me to the Cardano project. There are ups and downs in the market, but Cardano's design will allow it to stand the test of time because of its ""bend don't break"" approach. The demand for its use is pushing up against the flood gates and they will be opening over the next few months.  &nbsp;  Edits for grammar",991,2021-11-24 19:04:03,554

ADA,cryptocurrency,"Cardano is coasting into an iceberg, the crew are starting to see it, but no one wants to startle the passengers by preparing the lifeboats.","Sundaeswap swap has recently released their work around for the fact that UTXO currently cannot run a permissionless, decentralized AMM DEX (like Uniswap). Items of note:  -the Sundaeswap team determined that the entire Cardano chain, without any other dApps competing for resources, will have slower **PEAK** tx speeds than half the **AVERAGE** tx rate used by one dApp on ethereum. They compared cardano's peak to the average rate on Uniswap v3 (but didn't count v2). Cardano will have options to speed that up in the future, but they are not ready yet (see second link below). And even then, cardano will still be slower than ETH, the slowest layer one chain that anyone has ever heard of. [See u/grimmergrimmergrime 's comment for an estimate of v2's speed: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qnjmby/cardano_is_coasting_into_an_iceberg_the_crew_are/hjhhfz5?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3 ] SS swap claims a theoretical max tpm of 3800 is ""impressive."" 3800 tpm is an unverified max, and it is INCREDIBLY slow for a L1. For example, it's about 160x slower than Cosmos' max tpm.   -They accurately explain why all the other proposed solutions create vulnerabilities, weaknesses, market inefficiency, attack vectors and centralization that Uniswap type AMMs do not have  -They propose to add a novel, gated and ""trusted"" application-specific proof of stake layer with untested incentives (and untestable due to the lack of direct fee incentives on a testnet). They have determined that the best way to avoid the UTXO concurrency dilemma is to appoint third party aggregators to execute all of the orders, and ""[t]he first step is choosing trusted members of the community to run them."" So much for having the most decentralized chain.   -They rate every solution to this problem, including their own, as requiring more development work and creating more ""surface area [that] needs to be audited"" than Uniswap. So much for the advantage of UTXO being easier to audit.   :https://sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/sundaeswap-labs-presents-the-scooper-model-678d6054318d  Meanwhile, Cardano devs are finally getting serious about starting the public conversation around why txs fees are necessary to avoid catastrophic network congestion, why cardano needs decentralized development, and the mistake of not having a longterm roadmap and pursuing layer 2 solutions sooner:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3dc6zG9EjWE",723,2021-11-05 20:14:56,1263

This is the first project to have completed a move and I think as we have a date now for Smart Contracts (end of August) it will be the first of many.    While ETH 2.0 will be cheaper and faster than Ethereum is now, there’s still a compelling case for projects to use the ERC-20 converter, move over to Cardano and enjoy cheaper fees, faster transactions, energy efficient network and have their token represented natively with all the same rights and priorities on the network as ADA.    Charles Hoskinson claims there are just over 100 projects looking to move from Eth to Cardano as more functionality is added in the coming months. Whether that number changes due to updates in Ethereum 2.0’s development remains to be seen.",1156,2021-05-29 09:37:09,492

ADA,cryptocurrency,The Cardano Project's work in Africa should be a reminder to everybody the real-world impact crypto currencies can have on ensuring a better future for everybody; not just the wealthy.,"\*Trying this again, as auto-mod removed it\*  &#x200B;  Let me start by saying, no I'm not a Cardano shill, and I'm not telling you to invest in it; I'm simply using it as an example here to showcase that crypto is far more than a fun thing to gamble your money on.  Cardano recently announced it's ambitions to help elevate underdeveloped nations, one way being that they want to ""bank the unbanked"". Essentially, give people access to more stable and substantial financial services, who would otherwise not have it. The impacts of this could be MASSIVE in countries that are often stricken with political turmoil and local fiat instability. This gives individual citizens, as well as bigger institutional investors a safer way to store their money if conflict or other variables threaten to devalue the local fiat.  I addition to adding an option for more stable finances, they are also hoping to lay down a foundation for African nations to take advantage of. Imagine like an Ethereum network, but with a goal of letting underdeveloped nations have a chance to utilize the full capabilities of blockchain to improve the lives of their citizens. Once example was outlined in a deal between Cardano and the Ethiopian government.  Ethiopia plans to use the Cardano blockchain to track student's progress in education, to determine how to improve said education. But just as with Ethereum and other similar networks, the possibilities are pretty unlimited. Something as simple as improving national education standards in Ethiopia would be a MASSIVE and EXPENSIVE undertaking that could never be afforded without the help of blockchain technology. And the impact of improving education could be astronomical. Seeing any movement like this makes me very happy, and very hopeful.  My point is this:   Sure, crypto is a really fun hobby and money make for most of us. It is fun to watch the (green) charts, and read up on new projects. But lets not forget that the crypto-sphere is way more than an alternative to the stock market. Many of these projects are driven by extremely driven (possibly delusional sometimes) teams, with ambitions to make the world better for all of humankind. This is the reason I can handle the dips and red days without feeling too down about it; because I truly believe crypto and blockchain tech are the future. They will continue pushing the boundary, and could help solve some of our biggest humanitarian crises. So even if I lose some money on ambitious projects that didn't pan out, I feel good knowing that I am still an active part of bringing in a more positive future for humanity.  Fiat currency has been ruined by corrupt government and greedy corporations; crypto will certainly have it's fair share of that in the near future. I just hope we don't lose sight of the possibilities it puts in the hands of the ""non-elite""  If you want to hear any more about the Ethiopia/education project, [here is a good article on it.](https://www.coindesk.com/from-paper-to-cardano-blockchain-iohk-in-ethiopia)",1621,2021-05-11 18:29:14,252
ADA,cryptocurrency,Crypto gets an unexpected Super Bowl appearance as Charles Hoskins has a 30 second chat with why Cardano is superior to Ethereum,"With the SEC focused on Staking as a Service and Ethereum getting focused as having an unaffordable minimum staking requirement for retail - in hindsight it seemed inevitable that Charles Hoskinson would find a way to try and get people focused on Cardano.

We need to talk about the Elephant in the room. While the SEC attacks staking and Ethereum - you must know that Cardano that's C-A-R-D-A-N-O, is not like Ethereum. Unlike Ethereum requiring nearly $50K you can stake Cardano with under $1. Cardano even allows you to maintain full control of your crypto in your wallet while staking, unlike Ethereum forcing you to lock it up for unknown amounts of time. While the SEC attacks staking as a service it's important for everyone to remember, unlike Ethereum, Cardano is highly competitive and the best choice for your Staking needs.  Thank you America, may the best team win.

Many people dont even know that XLM already has smart contracts and NFTs for some time.  At the same time most people know that Cardano will have smart contracts in the future.  Cardanos strength is not its features, it is marketing, Charles Hoskinsons biggest strength is advertising upcoming promises and features.  At the same time the Stellar (XLM) Foundation is very quiet about promises and advertising their crypto, while actually delivering on these features. Did you know that the literal country of Ukraine has picked them to help build their national digital currency?  If it would have been Cardano, you would hear that being hyped up for the next two years, while most people are not even aware of XLMs international partnerships.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano Criticisms,"I'll start by saying I used to love Cardano and think it was the future of everything decentralized.  I drank all the kool-aid.  However, as of late, I've started to really get fed up with the project.  Charles is awful. Development is slow. Criticism is lacking within the community. It still has a chance to do something moving forward, but I'm not putting all my eggs in that basket.  Here's a list of criticisms I've found that hold some merit  * Peer-review: If you look at the peer-reviewed papers listed on the IOHK site, you will find that most papers are actually just sent to online repositories which state in the fine print that submissions are not peer reviewed * Cardano literally has to write Haskell coding libraries from scratch. This slows development dramatically. Additionally, it takes 10+ years to harden a code library, meaning there will be securities concerns on Cardano for years to come. * Charles has never actually finished a project. He seems to be a serial entrepreneur that gets rich and then moves on. * Charles acts like he is all for unity, then goes on to trash any project that takes a different approach than Cardano.  He literally highjacked the Ethereum Classic Twitter account and swapped it to ERGO, which has a relationship the Cardano. He is simply filling his own bags. * Having an active community on github, in reality, means nothing when projects aren't completed. Progress isn't actually made. * IOHK might be good at science, but they have not shown they are capable of delivering practically useful products *  In twitter polls, the Cardano community has built bots to game the results.  There are numerous twitter polls that point blank ask ""I am a human"" and ""Cardano"" and Cardano wins by a landslide.  * Catalyst, their governance model where they award ADA, has 0 follow-through. Some projects were awarded tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of ADA, and never delivered on their promises. Basically a marketers dream * Speed and TX fees are relatively high when compared to other smart contract chains, with the exception of Ethereum. Cardano pushes for global adoption and helping the impoverished, and then charge .17 ADA per TX, which is significantly higher than chains like ALGO, MATIC, AVAX, etc. * Elitist community, with nothing to show to back up the elitism.  In conclusion, I hope Cardano does deliver on their promises, but the way the project is trending compared to the rest of the market and other platforms, I have  doubts about its longevity.",384,2022-10-19 21:46:29,633

This provides the headroom to make more aggressive scaling  changes, such as increasing block size/increasing Plutus parameter limits.  **Input Endorsers**  Input endorsers  improve block propagation times and throughput by allowing transactions  to be separated into pre-constructed blocks. This improves the  consistency of block propagation times and allows higher transaction  rates.  **Memory /CPU parameters for Plutus**  Memory  usage is more efficient across the chain. Specifically, there are  memory improvements in Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) handling, stake  distribution, live stake distribution and pools, and hash  representation.  **Plutus script enhancements**  Even more effective usage of the powerful EUTXO model through smart contract optimization, including:   * Reference  inputs (CIP-0031)  – Plutus scripts can inspect transaction inputs  without needing to spend them. This means that it is not necessary to  create UTXOs simply to inspect the information held by an input. * Plutus  Datums (CIP-0032) – Datums can be attached directly to outputs instead  of datum hashes. This simplifies how datums are used, as a user can see  the actual datum rather than having to supply the datum that matches the  given hash. * Script sharing (CIP-0033) – Plutus script  references can be associated with transaction outputs, meaning that they  can be recorded on-chain for subsequent reuse. It will not be necessary  to supply a copy of the script with each transaction, hugely reducing  friction for developers. Reusing scripts in multiple transactions  significantly reduces transaction sizes, improving throughput and  reducing script execution costs.  **Node enhancements**  Improvements  will help even distribution of stake and reward computations across the  epochs, thus providing greater headroom for block size increases. Also,  memory usage is now more efficient. Memory compaction reduces RSS  footprint, and memory sharing means we need less data instantiated. Node  version 1.3.3, from January 2022, reduces peak load at critical points,  including the epoch boundary.  **On-disk storage**  By  storing portions of the protocol state on disk, nodes will need to hold  less in memory, meaning that RAM-constrained systems will be able to  run nodes provided they have sufficient storage, and memory will no  longer be a bottleneck on scalability. This will enable significant  growth in the blockchain state.  ## Off-chain solutions  **Sidechains**  A sidechain is a separate blockchain connected to a main blockchain (the  'main' chain, also known as parent chain), through a two-way mechanism  (the 'bridge') that enables tokens and other digital assets from one  chain to be used in another and results returned to the original chain.  Assets can be moved between chains as needed. One single parent chain  can have multiple interoperable sidechains connected to it, which may  operate in completely different ways. EVM sidechains coming to Cardano  include dcSpark’s Milkomeda and IOG’s Mamba.   **Hydra**  Introduces  isomorphic state channels to maximize throughput, minimize latency,  incur low to no costs, and greatly reduce storage requirements. Hydra  provides a more efficient means to process transactions off-chain while  using the main-chain ledger as the secure settlement layer.  **Off-chain computing**  Offloading  some of the computation, for example with Asynchronous Contract  Execution (ACE)  can drive greater core network efficiency. Transactions  occur outside of the blockchain itself, yet can offer fast, cheap  transactions via a trust model.  **Mithril**  To  achieve greater scalability, you need to address the complexity of  critical operations that depend logarithmically on the number of  participants. Mithril will improve chain synchronization while  maintaining trust. The result? Multi-signature aggregation that is fast  and efficient without compromising security features.  TL;DR: [All this summarized in one pic](https://ucarecdn.com/ff38dd08-5947-4c52-af32-15c59cdcdcf8/-/format/webp/-/quality/best/-/progressive/yes/)  Source: [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/01/14/how-we-re-scaling-cardano-in-2022/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/01/14/how-we-re-scaling-cardano-in-2022/)  Bonus:  Plutus is basically Haskell which is native smart contract language for the Cardano blockchain. Plutus contracts consist of parts that run on the blockchain  (on-chain code) and parts that run on a user’s machine (off-chain or  client code). Both the on-chain and off-chain code are written in Haskell, and Plutus smart contracts are effectively Haskell programs.",543,2022-01-16 13:14:09,577

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano now has almost 574 million ada in its treasury or almost 1.5 billion USD to fund YOUR projects and ADA HODLers having been voting on them throughout 2021! This is how self-sustainable ecosystem with governance looks like!,"Exactly   a year now ADA HODLers have been staking and delegating their ADA to   stake pool operators = validators and getting their rewards every epoch   (= 5days)  and on average yearly delegation rewards of around 5%.   Meaning that if you started with 100k ada you'll end up with around 105k   after one year... Note that the rewards from one epoch are added to  the  next and the next rewards are calculated based on that, pretty  sweet!  Cool  thing about staking  with ADA is that your ADA is never locked and you  can move it at any  time, which is not the case for ETH2 and  others...Also, pretty cool!  About 70% of the total CIRCULATING supply is staked, see [https://adapools.org/press](https://adapools.org/press) and you can imagine what that means for the price once the smart contracts drop on mainnet on 9/12!

Have you people ventured outside of it and Eth L1 by any chance? What's so great about Cardano? It cost me 0.2 ADA to SEND ADA... FROM A WALLET!!! Bruh! I mean, if that was it, maybe I'd ignore it, bite the bullet and keep trading, but it isn't... the DEXes require a freakin' 2 ADA deposit FOR EVERY SINGLE TRADE!!! What the actual f***!!! 😳 🤬🙄! Plus, it's slow 🐌! Painfully slow, if the person is used to proper blockchains.  All it takes is one visit to basically any other ecosystem to realize this thing stinks. Get at me, ADA bros. You're the most confusing investors in the space. I'm literally still waiting for the deposit and I've been writing this off and on (while doing other stuff) for the last 10 minutes.  Not shilling intentionally but facts: BSC, Solana, Algorand, Polygon, Polkadot, Avax, Cosmos, Internet Computer, Hedera, MultiversX, VeChain, every L2... all of them wildly outperform Cardano. In fact, it seems that big money investors agree, as Cardano's marketcap/tvl is not only the highest in the top-25 blockchains, it is one of only three blockchains with a score in the double-digits (and both of the alts in the bottom 3 are infinitely cheaper and faster to transact on):  BSC - 11.21 Solana - 31.45 Cardano - 59.98  59.98! Think about that... 22/25 blockchains have a score of 9.99 or less and this supposed Godsend (if you ask Ada maxis) still today sits almost 6x higher in the category that quite literally is used as part of the justification for the current market cap.   🤦‍♂️  It also has a remarkably tiny amount of stable coins on it 🤔🤨😮. $15M... I know many of you reading this don't understand just how little that is but I'll give a few examples for comparisons sake:  - ZkSync Era is ranked 1 above Cardano in total TVL and has almost 10x the amount of stables on it. It doesn't even have its own token yet!   - DefiChain (excuse me, what? What even is that?) has the same amount of stables on it. Its mcap/tvl is 1.02. I refuse to look this chain up to go more indepth than a few baseline stats but 🤦‍♂️omg Cardano.  - Ethereum, Tron, BSC, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, and Solana all have > $1B in stables. Cardano on the other hand is down on the list with a bunch of no-names like DefiChain, Mixin, Polygon zkEVM (not regular Polygon... no... their fledgling zkEVM). Shoot, even Osmosis is less than 2.5x away from Cardano in stables and only a 40% increase away in tvl...  Cardano isn't some upstart chain. This is one of the oldest, most maxi-heavy chains in existence... The state of things today is embarrassing. Literally no one should be an ADA-maxi. It's absurd! So, please ADA bros, get at me.

ADA,cryptocurrency,"Cardano teams up with Ergo blockchain, which uses UTXO-based accounting like Cardano&Bitcoin, to work on a stablecoin contract called Djed which is the first formally verified crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin contract that acts as an autonomous bank","Cryptocurrency volatility is one of the obstacles to its wider  adoption. Blockchain technologies provide benefits such as transparency,  data immutability, and proven security of financial operations. Yet, it  is harder than fiat currencies to predict how the market will behave,  or forecast the value of a digital currency. This hinders using  cryptocurrencies as accounting and exchange units in daily operations.  A  stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a basket of fiat currencies or  a single currency (eg, USD or EUR); commodities like gold or silver;  stocks; or other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins include mechanisms that  maintain a low price deviation from their target price and so are useful  to store or exchange value, as their built-in mechanisms remove the  volatility.   Some stablecoins lack transparency and liquidity of  their reserves, which compromises their price stability. To address  these challenges, IOG has teamed up with Emurgo, another of the three  founding partners of Cardano, and the Ergo blockchain, which uses  UTXO-based accounting like Cardano,  to work on a stablecoin contract  called Djed. Djed is based on algorithmic design. This means it uses  smart contracts to ensure price stabilization, and that the coin will be  useful for decentralized finance (DeFi) operations.   ## How stablecoins work  Different  mechanisms contribute to the stability of the coin’s value and help  eliminate price variations. These mechanisms are underpinned by the  economic principles of supply and demand.   A common mechanism is  backing the stablecoin by a reserve of the currency used as the peg. If  demand is higher than the supply of sell or buy orders, this supply  should be increased to avoid fluctuations in the price. Typically,  stablecoin reserves are not stored in cash. Instead, they are kept in  interest-bearing financial instruments such as bonds. The returns on  these provide revenue for the operator.   As long as the stablecoin  is fully backed by reserves in the currency to which it is pegged – and  the operator can react quickly to variations in demand – price  stability is maintained.   ## Common risks  Stablecoin reserves  are commonly associated with investments. The lack of liquidity of  these investments may prevent the operator from reacting quickly to  demand. This compromises stability in the short term.  A drawback  of fiat-backed stablecoins is that they require trust in the entities  keeping the reserves. Lack of the reserves’ transparency or of the  ‘full-backing’ claim, combined with inefficient stabilization measures,  have already caused Tether stablecoin (USDT) to fall below $0.96, as  shown in [Figure 1.](https://ucarecdn.com/20fef54f-2d33-4c16-9a74-3a74f4cb0420/-/format/webp/-/quality/best/-/progressive/yes/)   Issues of transparency do not arise when the backing asset is a  cryptocurrency on a public blockchain. Furthermore, the use of smart  contracts ensures efficient and reliable execution of stabilization  measures due to its automated and secure mechanisms.  ## Enhanced stabilization mechanisms of Djed algorithmic stablecoin  Djed is a crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin contract that acts as an autonomous bank. It operates by keeping a reserve of *base coins*, and minting and burning *stablecoins* and *reserve coins*.  The contract maintains the peg of stablecoins to a target price by  buying and selling stablecoins, using the reserve, and charging fees,  which accumulate in the reserve, as shown in [Figure 2](https://ucarecdn.com/8fac023c-68b9-4fbc-9ad3-9c8d2005c544/-/format/webp/-/quality/best/-/progressive/yes/). The ultimate  beneficiaries of this revenue stream are holders of reserve coins, who  boost the reserve with funds while assuming the risk of price  fluctuation.   The Djed stablecoin is designed as an asset pegged to a fiat  currency (USD), along with a governing algorithm. This approach provides  a stable means of exchange. But Djed is not limited to being pegged to  the dollar. It can work with other currencies, as long as there are  oracles providing the contract with the corresponding pricing index.  ## The first formally verified stablecoin protocol  Djed is the first *formally verified*  stablecoin protocol. The use of formal methods in the programming  process has greatly contributed to the design and stability properties  of Djed. Using formal techniques, the properties are proven by  mathematical theorems:  * **Peg upper and lower bound maintenance**:  the price will not go above or beyond the set price. In the normal  reserve ratio range, purchases and sales are not restricted, and users  have no incentive to trade stablecoins outside the peg range in a  secondary market. * **Peg robustness during market crashes**: up to a set limit that depends on the reserve ratio, the peg is maintained even when the price of the base coin falls sharply. * **No insolvency**: no bank is involved, so there is no bank contract to go bankrupt. * **No bank runs**:  all users are treated fairly and paid accordingly, so there is provably  no incentive for users to race to redeem their stablecoins. * **Monotonically increasing equity per reserve coin**:  under some conditions, the reserve surplus per reserve coin is  guaranteed to increase as users interact with the contract. Under these  conditions, reserve coin holders are guaranteed to profit.  * **No reserve draining**:  under some conditions, it is impossible for a malicious user to execute  a sequence of actions that would steal reserves from the bank. * **Bounded dilution**: there is a limit to how many reserve coin holders and their profit can be diluted due to the issuance of more reserve coins.  ## Djed versions  There are two versions of Djed:  * **Minimal Djed**: this version is designed to be as simple, intuitive, and straightforward as possible, without compromising stability.  * **Extended Djed**:  this more complex version provides some additional stability benefits.  The main differences are the use of a continuous pricing model and  dynamic fees to further incentivize the maintenance of the reserve ratio  at an optimal level.  ## Implementations  IOG, Ergo, and  Emurgo teams have been working on the implementation of the Djed  algorithmic stablecoin contract earlier in 2021 to test different  models.   The first implementation of a Djed stablecoin contract was [SigmaUSD](https://sigmausd.io/#/)  on Ergo. This was the first algorithmic stablecoin deployed on a  UTXO-based ledger in Q1 2021. It had a fee of 1% for buying or selling  operations, and an oracle that updated the exchange rate every hour.  This initial version was subject to a reserve draining attack by an  anonymous user who owned a large number of ERGs (Ergo’s native coin).  The attack was ultimately unsuccessful, and it is estimated that the  attacker lost $100,000.   To further discourage such attacks, this  initial deployment of Minimal Djed was replaced by a version where the  fee was set to 2%, the oracle updated every 12 minutes, and every oracle  update was allowed to change the price by at most 0.49%, unless the  price difference was greater than 50%. This provided stronger resilience  against reserve draining attacks.    Djed has also been  implemented by the IOG team in Solidity. One version uses the native  currency of the Ethereum blockchain as a base coin, and another uses any  ERC20-compliant token as a base coin. So far, these implementations  have been deployed to testnets for Binance Smart Chain’s testnet,  Avalanche’s Fuji, Polygon’s Mumbai, Ethereum’s Kovan, Ethereum’s  Rinkeby, and RSK’s testnet.  ## Djed: Cardano implementation  The  Alonzo update to Cardano will enable smart contracts using Plutus.  Plutus is powered by Haskell, which guarantees a safe, full-stack  programming environment.  Draft implementation of an earlier version of Minimal Djed is [available in the Plutus language](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-use-cases/src/Plutus/Contracts/Stablecoin.hs).  In this implementation, stablecoins and reserve coins are native assets  uniquely identified by the hash of the monetary policy that controls  their minting and burning according to the Djed protocol. This  implementation also assumes that oracle data such as the exchange rate  is provided as signed data directly to the transactions, instead of  being posted on-chain.  There is also an ongoing OpenStar  implementation. OpenStar is a framework for private permissioned  blockchains developed in Scala. The implementation of Djed using  OpenStar follows the idea of off-chain smart contract execution to have a  stablecoin on Cardano that does not depend on smart contracts executed  on-chain.  To find out more about Djed stablecoin, see the [recently published research paper](https://github.com/input-output-hk/djed/raw/main/papers/Djed.pdf) or check out the [presentation by Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zG-rxMCDIa0&t=8366s), IOG technical director, at Ergo summit 2021.  *We’d  like to thank and acknowledge Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo for his input to  this article and support throughout the process of its creation.*  [*https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/18/djed-implementing-algorithmic-stablecoins-for-proven-price-stability/*](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/18/djed-implementing-algorithmic-stablecoins-for-proven-price-stability/)",858,2021-08-18 19:04:03,308

I discovered that Cardano is moving forward with great tech and innovation. It is in the top ten crypto projects at #8 following Bitcoin and Etherium. Cardano has been in the top ten for a very long time and will probably be in the top 5 this next bull market. The project is solid. The only problem I see is that the marketing is horrible. Hoskins himself said they don't want hype moon boy price action. They want steady organic growth which I think is excellent in the long run. Building something to last over time.

Cardano does not have a fee market so transactions go into a big queue, first in first out. So if you spam a lot of transactions onto the network the queue will quickly start to build, there is no mechnism for honest transactions to skip the queue or for high value transactions to be prioritised over the spam.

ADA,cryptocurrency,"Please tell me without making any promises of the future, What has Cardano done in the last 5 years that it should deserve its spot?","I have been in crypto since 2017 and following Cardano.

I'm not talking about what is 'almost there' what I have been hearing for the last years already. What has been done so far? Please provide arguments and facts and not some vague narrative of 'best decentralized staking' or something else. A data driven approach on the amount of use cases so far would be appreciated. Saying that smart contracts are almost there etc. etc. is not an argument. Even if thats true thats literally just the beginning. That means nothing. Being happy that smart contracts are coming in a few months after starting around the same time as Ethereum is extremely worrying of how serious 'investors' are here.

Do all of you see a pattern here?  Edit 3: Publishing scientific papers is nothing fancy. I dont know why people keep mentioning this as if its something special. Algorand, Ethereum Zilliqa etc. are also doing this. Also, its only worthwile *if its implemented in reality and isn't just stuck in theory*  Edit 4: Finally 1 good argument in almost 400 comments. Which is ""Implemented native multi assets"". This is actually a useful feature and good use case to increase the value of Cardano. Btw, please stop automatically assuming that everything Cardano has built is already the best. You dont know that. It has not been battletested yet. Its all assumptions and speculation.  Edit 5: To be honest, I am kind of dissappointed in this subreddit. For months I have been wanting to write a post like this but thought maybe others will. But literally 100s of Cardano post and nobody ever asked 'but what have they done so far'? And this is suppose to be the main cryptocurrency subreddit? This just means there is barely any critical discussion going on. Its a bit insane to me that so many people invested in Cardano but can't barely even answer basic questions and just personally attack me because 'I'm jealous' or whatever. But I guess its going up in value and they figured out the right marketing formula. Feels like EOS all over again. But at least EOS launched lol.  **Edit 6**: Ok this will be my last edit. I just want to leave everyone to think about what's going on. Its always easy to sell a dream than to sell something that is functional and being used. Selling a dream about the future you can exaggerate and you cannot dispute. You can make it as big as you want it to be and if enough people believe it it can get some kind of 'cult like' charisma. But think about this. This is a team with billions of funding. Hundreds of people working on it and it is one of the oldest teams in crypto. Having so much money and people should speed things up, not slow it down. Do you really think that they can keep up with the story they are telling after showing barely anything for the last years? There are teams like Aave with 20 million of funding that have done more in less time with a much smaller team. Just please think about this. Forget about the money and market cap and promises.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Researching L1s and can’t quite place Cardano.,"Bitcoin is king but it’s interesting to study other L1s and I’ve primarily been diving into the Ethereum and Solana developer ecosystems.   Ethereum, as is well known by now has such an extensive and flourishing developer environment. There’s so much being built and the tooling is pretty mature at this point, making it easy for new developers to enter the space.   Solana is exciting too, but you can tell developers are more hardware focused, attracting a lot of former Apple, Tesla and SpaceX devs. However, it’s easy to forget how tiny the eco system is compared to Ethereum, or even some of the Ethereum L2s. But cool things are being built and deployed and while I’m a lot less familiar with the Solana tooling, it seems to attract projects wanting to build upon the Solana blockchain.   I then tried to do a similar case study on Cardano, but I’m finding it a lot more challenging. It’s very possible that I’m just attacking it wrong. But where there are loads of developer conferences for both Ethereum and Solana where it’s pretty clear how the respective blockchains differ from each other and where their focus is, I’m not really seeing the same in Cardano, apart from the Cardano Summit (which seems primarily to have been virtual?). From the surface it seems people are more focused on developing Cardano than developing on Cardano.   Can someone help me place Cardano in the L1 space?",188,2023-12-03 19:53:54,308

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano FUD no longer has any teeth,"Cardano haters seem to be running out of ammunition.  For context, the FUD has been extremely bad at times, and without justification.    However with every planned and well executed technical upgrade of the Cardano project, a little more of the Cardano haters arsenal has evaporated.  It seems the only thing they have, to try and steer new users away from Cardano is some attacks on Charles Hoskinson.  While this could have some impact for the school-yard oriented mindset, any savvy person, who knows whats-what isn't going to pay it much attention.  A decentralized block-chain project is not one person, and Cardano is mighty decentralized.  So Im calling it, Cardano-haters have failed, the project goes from strength to strength, and the noise from the edges will continue to quieten.",305,2022-03-24 17:39:52,806
ADA,cryptocurrency,"The last time BTC was above $67K was Nov. 10th 2021. ETH was ~$5K, Cardano was $2.27 and Polkadot was $51. A look at how the Crypto Markets has changed since then.","You might have seen Bitcoin (BTC) Peaked today around $67.5K nearly hitting a new ATH. The last time BTC was this high was November 10th 2021.  At that time ETH was almost $5k, Terra and it's associated stable coin were making waves with 20% apy, and FTX was still a functioning business. The market has changed significantly since 2021 and this post is going to focus on some of those changes.  # The Blood of Alts run in the Streets  In every Bear Market, Alts tend to signficantly lose value against Bitcoin. Of the top 100 Cryptos on Nov. 10th 2021, only four have increased in value. (Tron, LEO, Stacks, OKB)  Alts like Cardano and Algo were both about $2.25 the last time BTC was at this price point. Today they are around $.75 and $.25 respectively. ETH peaked just short of $5K and today sits under $4k.

In May 2022 Terra Luna was one of the biggest and most well known crypto plays. The crypto consisted of two parts:  1. A Cryptocurrency called: Terra 2. A StableCoin called UST:  Terra could be treated as a speculative Crypto investment, or it could be converted into UST ""A stablecoin"" with 20% interest.  The two were supposedly algorithmically pegged, in the event UST lost value and depegged from $1 a repeg could be reestablished my taking money from Terra to get the value back to $1.  But... What happens when UST depegs and people also lose trust in Terra? The answer is a death spiral, and that is exactly what happened in May of 2022. First UST depegged and lost it's $1 peg, than Terra began to mass inflate decreasing the value of all other Terra tokens. This caused more people to want to get out of UST and resulted in a complete collapse of both projects.  https://preview.redd.it/m187jlu4mdmc1.png?width=1761&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fe6bb0a5e69ddd991987718ee60489ce6de5461  CoinDesk has an in depth article on this subject: [Here](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/the-fall-of-terra-a-timeline-of-the-meteoric-rise-and-crash-of-ust-and-luna/)  Many crypto projects were taking advantage of the supposedly safe 20% yield that UST offered and this single event cause shockwaves through the entire crypto ecosystem with many Crypto entities failing or going bankrupt as a result.  Barry Silbert the once famous CEO of Digital Currency Group was one of many organizations to fail after the collapse of Terra and UST.  https://preview.redd.it/5d79kug6ndmc1.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbe6924373bfce827e80bcfa4827767140e0c1e4  # FTX Goes out of Business  FTX was once the #3 Crypto Exchange behind only CoinBase and Binance. Towards the end of 2022, it was discovered that FTX was padding their books with their own exchange token FTT. This questionable financing lead to many users doubting the liquidity of FTX and created a run on the exchange.  A few days later FTX declared bankruptcy and it was discovered there was a multi billion dollar hole of user assets in FTX.  https://preview.redd.it/aa5uqbrrpdmc1.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb23e84cf8c39655f76c013d153f210f9631046  Blockworks has a timeline on the collapse of FTX: [here](https://blockworks.co/news/ftx-meltdown-timeline)  # The End of an Era: Binance CEO CZ steps down and pleads guilty  After the collapse of FTX, CZ Binance famously said that 2023 would be full of FUD and he would respond ""4."" to FUD.  https://preview.redd.it/4z4a8pfbqdmc1.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&s=d33a1f3562d038a823b06333b403ba67ee598cdc  What wasn't FUD is that Binance was a shady organization that aimed to put Corporate Growth over Compliance.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano - Step by step guide to staking ADA,"Cardano, and its native coin ADA, is one of the most solid blockchain platform projects currently. The team has shown repeatedly that they can deliver on their promises and the project is famous for being backed by peer-reviewed research. Exciting news are coming for this project so be sure to check their website [https://cardano.org](https://cardano.org) and their roadmap [https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/).  This post will be a step-by-step guide to staking your ADA. There are various ways to proceed but we will be using the **Yoroi chrome extension**. Additionally, although not required, it is **highly recommended to use a hardware wallet**. Any of the following will do:  * Ledger Nano S * Ledger Nano X * Trezor model T  This guide will cover the following:  1. Set up the Yoroi google chrome extension 2. Connect or create your ADA wallet 3. Send ADA to your wallet 4. Choose a stake pool and delegate your ADA 5. Staking rewards  # 1) Set up the Yoroi google chrome extension  First of all, we need to install the Yoroi Chrome extension. Navigate to the official wallet page [https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/) and download the extension.  &#x200B;  [Download the Yoroi Google Chrome extension](https://preview.redd.it/qg5evijpl9w61.png?width=1267&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c7f1f64edf61e9aab53ccffc52422579f4c1b5)  Once dowloaded, you will need to click 'Add to Chrome' and 'Add extension' to enable the extension in Chrome.  It will then appear in the top-right corner of your Chrome browser (click the little puzzle piece icon) and you may want to pin it to keep it visible.  &#x200B;  [Shortcut to the Yoroi extension](https://preview.redd.it/8ecdgxntl9w61.png?width=326&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b77ff98d2e77b7999d034346da8ef4deb134b03)  Now you can launch the Yoroi extension and, as this is the first time, we will need to go through a few setup steps:  * Choose language * Agree to the terms and conditions * Choose 'Simple' level of complexity * Skip 'Cardano payments URL' and confirm (you can always set it up later if needed)  That's it, the extension is ready to use and your home page should now look like this.  &#x200B;  [Yoroi wallet home screen](https://preview.redd.it/rsutop7vl9w61.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=66e90e3c773afef5225494bd1c808165ff5617ca)  # 2) Connect or create your ADA wallet  The safest option at this point is to use a hardware wallet. If you do not have one yet, you can always create a local wallet to start with (and and transfer your coins to your hardware wallet when you do buy one).  # 2.a) Connect to a hardware wallet  I will use the Trezor model T to illustrate but the Ledger Nano works similarly  * One the home screen menu, select 'connect to a hardware wallet', * Select 'Cardano' * Select your hardware wallet type: either Ledger or Trezor * Choose Shelley-era wallet, as we want to be able to stake * Your hardware wallet needs to have already been initialised, press 'Next'  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/2gn4kmrwl9w61.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c79fe239e5b7691504cb808998406fdf900b070  * Now, make sure your hardware wallet is connected to the computer and unlocked, press 'Connect'  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/fqtxyesxl9w61.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=3021abf0a96c419a95c29bdcd2575a2f7d477f96  * A new page pops up to ask you to transfer your public key to the wallet. This is expected as the public key allows you to receive money to your wallet. Note that the private keys never leave your hardware wallet. Now click, 'Export'  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/a7bg4hvyl9w61.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=af7e7cd73343e4e803797abd151a2f85d74f6423  * Then, the wallet name, retrieved from your hardware wallet, will appear. Click 'Save' to complete this step and reach the Yoroi dashboard.  # 2.b) Create a local wallet  This section is only if you do not own a hardware wallet and want to use a software wallet instead. If you own a hardware wallet and have completed step 2.a, you can skip this section and proceed to step 3.  * On the home screen menu, select 'create wallet', * Select 'Cardano' * Choose 'Create wallet' * Enter a wallet name and a strong password, then 'Create personal wallet'  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/lk699320m9w61.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=58fd77bf09890ddc655590c92ec9f1cf840b4626  * The next step will give you your 15 words seed phrase. Make sure to write it down (on paper, no electronic support) and to keep (several copies) safe and labelled.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/3cwl5x21m9w61.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&s=091cc3fb943d0775033ca00fd20ef9388660b67f  * Once you have written it down, you will be asked to enter it to check you have it correctly. * Now you can confirm, your wallet is created and you are taken to the Yoroi dashboard.  # 3) Send ADA to your wallet  Welcome to your Yoroi dashboard.  &#x200B;  [Yoroi dashboard](https://preview.redd.it/szzqx7d2m9w61.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd301b23c37296518447beeee0df735e33d55833)  In order to transfer ADA to your wallet, simply go to the 'Receive' tab in order to copy your address. You can then use this address to transfer the ADA you will have bought in your favourite exchange. Note that ADA transaction fees are rather low at roughly 0.17 ADA.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/zgghlhj3m9w61.png?width=1238&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f71d4a58885bcbbb9c0c8008d0635a84baf13ee  # 4) Choose a stake pool and delegate your ADA  From your dashboard, we now move on to the 'Delegation' tab.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/fthbb2r6m9w61.png?width=1231&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d326a09dd1e5653bf5dfe98f9e4a9656ea6d21e  Here, we need to choose a staking pool from the list. If you do not know yet which pool to use, the best thing to do is to navigate to [https://pooltool.io/](https://pooltool.io/) in order to find a staking pool that you like, more on that later.  Once you have chosen a pool from the list, simply click 'Delegate' and confirm. You will also have to confirm the delegation with your Trezor/Ledger if you are using a hardware wallet. That's it, you're all set and you should see the total ADA delegated onto your dashboard. A few things to note:  * you can only delegate to a single pool * but you can cancel the delegation or switch pool at any time, there is no lock-up period * there is a 2 ADA staking fee registration that you need to pay the first time you start staking, so you do not need to pay it again in the future if you switch pool or add ADA to your wallet * any ADA sent to your wallet will automatically be staked in the pool you have chosen * similarly, the rewards are automatically added to your wallet and thus the interest is compounded.  Now the remaining question is how to choose a stake pool. The first thing to keep in mind is that there is no risk associated with staking ADA and the worst that can happen is that you do not receive any reward. First of all, we need to consider the following  * **Epoch**: the staking rewards are computed for each epoch, which lasts 5 days. * **Fees**: each pool will charge a fixed fee (typically 340 ADA per epoch) and a variable fee (aka pool margin). The fees will not be taken from your wallet and you can only earn ADA by staking. The fees are charged to the total amount earned by the stake pool during the epoch and then, the remaining is distributed among the participants of the pool proportionally to their contribution to the stake pool. In the example below, there will be 9,000 ADA left to be distributed to the members of the pool:  &#x200B;  |Total pool reward (example)|10,340 ADA| |:-|:-| |Fixed fee (340 ADA)|\-340 ADA| |Left after fixed fee|10,000 ADA| |Variable fee (e.g. 10%)|\-1,000 ADA| |Left after all fees|**9,000 ADA**|  &#x200B;  * **Saturation**: in order to discourage centralisation, the concept of saturation decreases the amount of reward to too large pools. Currently, the saturation level is 64M ADA. This means that you should not stake your ADA to pools where the staked amount is more than 64M ADA.  Now, let's go to [https://pooltool.io/](https://pooltool.io/) to select our pool.  &#x200B;  [A few stake pools on pooltool.io](https://preview.redd.it/wnv8xzahm9w61.png?width=1285&format=png&auto=webp&s=14ad9703b6d6f0bcc42ef5967b236ac97e91d8b6)  The important fields are the following:  * **Pool ID:** you can copy this address to paste in your Yoroi delegation tool once you have selected the right pool * **Epoch Fee:** these are the fixed fees and should be 340 * **Variable Fee:** you want to avoid too large fees but it is also worth paying a bit more to join a pool that you trust. Be aware that some pools are effectively closed and thus charge a 100% fee. Note also that some pool will have a very low, even zero, fee to help them grow but it might be increased in the future. * **Declared pledge:** the amount pledged by the pool operator at the time of creation of the pool, not massively important for the pool selection. * **Epoch ROS:** the expected annualised return in the current epoch, this will typically be around 5%. * **Live stake:** the total amount staked in the pool, it is important that this remains under the saturation threshold of 64M. * **Lifetime ROS:** the historical return of the pool, this shows you past performance of the pool.  There is also an official calculator to compute your expected rewards depending on the various parameters: [https://cardano.org/calculator/?calculator=delegator](https://cardano.org/calculator/?calculator=delegator) .  # 5) Staking rewards  The staking rewards are paid with a three epochs delay. This means that you do not receive any reward for the first 15-20 days but you keep receiving rewards for 15-20 days if you cancel your delegation.  The rewards are paid at the end of every epoch (for the amount you delegated three epochs prior), hence every 5 days. The typical APY will be around 5% but the rewards are spread over 365/5 = 73 payments. Consequently, the average rewards per epoch is approximately  &#x200B;  [Average reward per epoch](https://preview.redd.it/1v9htknkm9w61.png?width=204&format=png&auto=webp&s=be842927c1319a7cca337d7908ac1a986c300ebd)  For example, this is **approximately 0.68 ADA per epoch per 1,000 ADA delegated**.  &#x200B;  [Average reward per epoch for 1,000 staked ADA](https://preview.redd.it/73y0pu5mm9w61.png?width=214&format=png&auto=webp&s=42a245321926fc974676355c7b984f5bef041667)  I hope you will find this guide helpful.  # Links  Cardano website [https://cardano.org](https://cardano.org/) and the roadmap [https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/).

The decision is up to you, I will simply list a few pros and cons.  Pros of staking on Binance:  * Binance allows you to stake directly on the exchange which is certainly easier to set up than the above.  * Moreover, Binance claims to be able to provide a better return than the 5% you get when staking through Yoroi.  Cons of staking on Binance:  * ""Not your keys, not your coins"": the coins are held by Binance rather than safely in your hardware wallet. Therefore, you are at risk of losing them: Binance servers could go down, be hacked, ... * Staking in smaller pools helps with the decentralisation of the network. Staking in the large Binance pools is against the spirit of the project. * Another minor point, Binance proposes locked staking so you do not always have access to your coins contrary to the above staking method where there is no lock-up period.  &#x200B;",863,2021-04-30 07:51:26,261
