ETH,cryptocurrency,Ethereum falls to 4-year low against Bitcoin as BTC breaks above $94k,,2759,2024-11-20 14:27:25,535
ETH,cryptocurrency,Realised today that I don't like where Ethereum is going,"Background :  I only hold BTC and ETH (70%/30%).   I've been around in the crypto space for a very long time.   The following is my own opinion and this a this a friendly discussion about ETH only. I'm not looking for alternatives, I already know most of them.  Lately, I've been really considering swaping my ETH for BTC (at least for now) for the following reasons:  * Ethereum team pretty much completely gave up on scaling the main chain. they are now solely focused on improving L2s and pushing people toward using them. * I think L2 suck, and that they're not user friendly. some people might argue that bridging tokens is ""easy"", but I think you're missing other important points : 1- whenever i want to get paid in ETH from a business or someone, NO ONE EVER has a withdraw/payment with L2s. same goes with sending money to normal people. 2- This is pretty much how L2 feels to for anyone I've ever talked to : Risky / Complicated / afraid coins will be lost (multiple chains and names confusing) / afraid to use a malicious site / Fuck this, I rather just use another cheap L1 chain. * This is how I see BTC/ETH : -I hold BTC because i believe it's the best store of value (like gold) -I hold ETH because i believe it's a cheaper way to move money, while also being safe store of value that's not gonna dump and die in the future. The thing is now, I'm starting to believe that Ethereum lost the position as a cheap L1 chain and it's never getting it back because they don't care about cheap L1 anymore. (like how Vitalik's gas limit proposition got ignored and sharding on L1 not being a priority anymore). Your bags aside, how can you possibly think that most people will be using L2s in the future, when you can clearly see that people are having a hard time just wrapping their head around basic crypto stuff ? I just can't see it.  **UPDATE** : Thank you all for your answers and ideas. I came now to realization that it is unreasonable to expect ETH to achieve low fees on L1, while at the same time keeping the same level of decentralization and security. I still believe L2 as it stands is not user friendly enough. and thanks to u/kumomax1911 comment, I know now that there is ongoing work to make L2 more seamless experience without the need for bridging (still need to search more about it) . I think that would be a good compromise to the current situation. only time will tell.",758,2024-03-18 14:48:01,863
ETH,cryptocurrency,Ethereum just hit a brand new 3.5 year low against Bitcoin.,"ETH just hit a brand new 3 and a half year low against BTC after touching .03462 beating it's last 3 and a half year low of .03465 set just 8 days ago on Nov. 06th 2024. (.03462 means 1 eth is worth 3.46% of 1 BTC. )  In fact this means ETH has wiped all out gains against BTC since April 2021 when ETH was \~2k and BTC was around \~$60k. Since then ETH has completed the merge moving it from POW to POS and Proto-Danksharding (which dropped the gas cost on L2s). Still in comparing it's value against BTC, ETH has officially lost all of it's bear market gains.

Ethereum has so much potential, but its price hasn’t seen the same explosive growth that Bitcoin has. What does Ethereum need to experience a significant price surge?

ETH,cryptocurrency,Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash are pumping...which means the latest batch of noob retail investors have finally arrived!,"I think many of you would consider Ethereum Classic a terrible investment, considering (1) it was the result of a hack, and (2) the hacker still has their bags of ETC available, which they periodically dump on unsuspecting investors. Bitcoin Cash doesn't have such a problematic origin, but might also be considered an unwise purchase given the lack of usage and development compared to BTC and other good projects.  So, when I open the charts and see that specifically BCH and ETC have been pumping hard for the last couple of days, my only conclusion is that new retail investment money has arrived and these noobs are dropping cash on 'cheaper' projects with the name Bitcoin and Ethereum in it. I should know, I did this exact thing myself earlier this year!  Here's hoping this signals the start of a another massive pump too.  Edit: spelling",6939,2021-11-10 12:41:18,1775

ETH,cryptocurrency,"Cardano network clogged, Avalanche congested a while ago, Polygon almost stopped completely due to some flower picking game. Are these really going to work as an alternative to Ethereum with its high gas fees?","Before anyone goes nuclear I will say that ETH is too damn expensive. But are the alternatives really so much better?   Recent news about Cardano congestion shooting up around 90% and more, Polygon being borderline unresponsive during Sunflower popularity/incident, and AVAX fees getting sky high while network suffered congestion a few months ago.  If these networks had the Ethereum levels of activitynon them, they wouldnt hold for long. Cardano has a handful of dapps and its already clogged? Same with Polygon. 1 dapp putting whole network on stop is really not what people would expect of the so called ""next gen eth competitors.""  While I 100% agree that gas fees on Ethereum are absurd, I wonder if the alternatives that we have at the moment in top10 are going to solve that. All claim insane TPS and finality times, but when the shit gets real, the fees and network congestion go up to the sky.",4623,2022-01-27 16:14:15,2952

ETH,cryptocurrency,The Ethereum Value Proposition: Dark Horse Edition,"If you’ve been in this sub for years, you may remember a series of posts here dubbed “ethereum value proposition” back in 2021 by yours truly during an epic eth fud campaign before ETH went on its face ripping rally.   Check the receipts, I did a multi week series in mid march 2021 and days later eth made the face melting gains 3x and up.  Why am I telling you this? To toot my own horn? No.   It’s because the reason I made those posts years ago was because the market was being HIGHLY irrational toward ETH and I believe it is doing it again, and where irrationality exists, opportunity for gains exists as well.  If you’ve had a pulse in crypto the last 3-6 months you’ll know everyone and their mom has turned bearish on ETH. In 2021 the criticism was “EtH cAnT ScALe”, now it’s “EtH is DeD”  Nonsense. And here’s why:  Tradfi has quickly realized that the megalithic opportunity in crypto is stablecoins (see https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1857408855719674075).  As you can see stablecoin volume has skyrocketed in the last 4 years eclipsing PayPal, bitcoin, remittances, and ALMOST approaching the levels of VISA, the largest payment processor in the world.  Guess where the VAST majority of stablecoin volume happens? Yep Ethereum and it’s L2s. Over 70%.  “Oh but ETH L1 has no usage no one uses it or oh it’s L2s are dead bla bla bla.”   No, ETH has significantly scaled by introducing “blobs” a few months back. check L2beat, Ethereum and its L2s users and transactions are near all time highs for an aggregate of ~370 TPS currently. Source: https://l2beat.com/scaling/activity  “Oh ok so some people use ETH big deal, but it’s still not a good investment”  If that were true,why then while everyone and their mom has been fudding ETH, Blackrock, (the largest hedge fund in the world)in the last 2 months has increased it’s holdings of ETH in its ETFs by a whopping 65%? Source: https://x.com/EthereanVibin/status/1858254969389863290  Why is over 95% of Blackrocks “BUIDL” fund of over 500 million dollars built on Ethereum?  Why are states like Florida and Michigan starting to acquire ETH? Florida now holds over 800 million in crypto related investments and Michigan 11 million: https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/michigan-largest-ethereum-etf-holders-us/  “Oh but Bitcoin is the only scarce asset with real value for holders, everything else is just a scam or gambling”  Since proof of stake and the burn was implemented about 3 years ago ETH has had HALF the inflation rate of bitcoin: https://ultrasound.money/  In laymen’s terms, bitcoin is being printed at twice the rate of ETH. People literally do not realize this. This is beyond significant.  Michael Saylor himself, the bitcoin messiah has said that bitcoin HAS to figure out a way to generate yield, because just holding it long term is not economically feasible, direct quote:  “The point is If the capital doesnt generate a return  its a non performing asset, you need to address the issue. If I put $100B into $BTC and the yield is 0%, thats just as bad as having $100B bonds that pay 0% yield. In both cases theyre non performing""  Source: https://x.com/etheraider/status/1836493170772971646  What this means is that Saylor fully recognizes that yield is KING.  Everyone knows that stocks that provide quality yield command a premium, you don’t think crypto assets will command the same premium anon?  But don’t confuse yield with inflation, yield comes from “activity/MEV/fees”, because if you have high yield due to inflation and not from actual usage of the chain, then your yield will be high but so will the inflation of your coin so you never come out ahead.  And what chain has the purest native premium on yield? The one with the most activity/mev/fees RELATIVE to its inflation, in other words Ethereum.  Saylor for a long time discredited eth because he said it was a security. Now it officially is not. He now says he wants a “form of bitcoin” aka a scarce asset that gives him yield…..  You do the math.  Saylor may never capitulate and buy ETH due to pride or maybe because he’s built a religious cult following and attack the fragility of bitcoin maximalism by holding another asset but that doesn’t mean you have to repeat his mistake.  Is ETH the BEST asset in crypto? No, there’s no way I can make that claim about any asset without being biased or disingenuous.  Is it ONE of the best risk adjusted reward plays right now given history, tech, present social bias, and network effect?  Absolutely.   I could go on and on about how ETH has always outperformed BTC in bull cycles, how the weekly RSI is at all time historic lows and therefore represents a legendary buying opp, etc etc  But I’ll end with this:  3 years ago the level of FUD surrounding ETH is what prompted me to post this series because it was so over the top irrational.  The same pattern is repeating now.  If you listened then and did the counter trade congrats. If you didn’t, here’s your second chance  Don’t fall for the CT FUD doomloop.  ETH is the dark horse this cycle.  Load up, you won’t regret it.",639,2024-11-18 14:45:15,372

ETH,cryptocurrency,The Ethereum triple halving and why ETH will easily overtake BTC in marketcap,"&#x200B;  So, why do I make such a confident claim as to why Ethereum will easily surpass BTC as the largest cryptocurrency by almost every metric including market cap? Simply put, its because the Ethereum selling pressure is going to reduce by as much as 90% – the equivalent of three Bitcoin halvenings in the span of 12 months. ETH will experience what is known as a triple halving, yes you read that right, a triple halving. To understand the triple halving of ETH we need to first understand what the BTC halving is:  * A Bitcoin halving event is when the reward for mining bitcoin transactions is cut in half. * This event also cuts in half Bitcoin's inflation rate and the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation. * It is widely thought that all previous halvenings are closely correlated to the initiation of bull market cycles leading to much higher prices than previous cycles.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ya4ccg2yuqh71.png?width=1070&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb05471edf3ba58045ef2534d2b377c4f5413c91  Ethereum will undergo a triple halving, or in other words, 50% \* 50% \* 50% = 12.5%, i.e. a 87.5% reduction in issuance which is the equivalent to 3 consecutive Bitcoin halving events. The upcoming Triple Halving will likely lead to a price explosion that I believe will allow ETH to easily overtake BTC in market cap. In this post I will discuss \*\*two\*\* key events that lead to the triple halving and why ETH will then easily overtake BTC as the most dominant crypto currency.  * The first event, and likely the least impactful of the two events will be caused by EIP-1559. On August 5th, EIP-1559 was passed, which means that 70% of the transaction fees in Ethereum will continually be burned. The more the network is used, the more fees will be burned. It is expected that with the deployment of EIP-1559, Ethereum would become net deflationary and stand at 2% negative annual issuance. In just one week over $100M of ETH was burned, this is insane. The drop in sell pressure represents a 30% reduction with the release of EIP-1559 which represent just over half of one BTC halving  https://preview.redd.it/cneo5zbzuqh71.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=636dc44bcedbadf71323f6e2ba73c5e23ced28f1  * The second (and very significant) cause would be the transition to Proof of Stake (POS) from Proof of Work (POW). To understand what this means we firstly need to understand Ethereum mining. As it stands, approximately 12,800 ETH (equivalent to $39,000,000) is rewarded to miners for running the Ethereum network and keeping it secure every day. Since ETH is still in a Proof of Work system most of this ETH is immediately dumped and sold into the market. Since the miners run a cash business, they need cash for electricity, equipment, paying investors etc. So everyday there is \*\*at least\*\* $39,000,000 worth of selling pressure for ETH each and every day. The implications for this transition means that ETH will go from a mine and dump economy (POW) to a stake and restake economy (POS). POS encourages saving as the more ETH you have the bigger your monetary benefit; this will not be for true all people as of course people will still sell a lot of ETH but most people will hold and restake their rewards as time goes by, enormously reducing sell pressure.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/2y8ue7j0vqh71.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5767436475c53af3d23266a2edb01c4cfde5998  So now you know what the ETH triple halving will lead to ETH being deflationary and have a \~90% reduction in sell pressure, we will discuss why ETH will overtake BTC in market dominance. Firstly, price leads narrative. A narrative by itself potentially creates a price increase. A narrative with a significant price increase validates the narrative and induces a price explosion. The following events will convince any investor that ETH is ultra sound money:  1. Exploding active accounts and transaction volume 2. Low fees - The most significant problem with Ethereum is scalability and is about to be solved, once and for all. The Layer 2 deployment is in full swing and the transaction fees will come down in the future 3. Powerful DeFi & staking yields 4. An environmentally-friendly Ethereum 2.0. ETH 2.0 will require 99% less energy to run and this is required to break into mainstream adoption. This is an obstacle where BTC failed. BTC is currently using up 0.7% of the world’s electricity while only serving 50 million people and you would likely need to use 70% to serve 5B (Full global adoption). Climate protection is the number one agenda in many developed countries and simply for this reason is why BTC will never truly be able to become mainstream  Another likely scenario is sooner rather than later Elon Musk will ride the ETH bandwagon, the news of Elon Musk praising Ethereum’s soon upcoming launch of energy-friendly Ethereum 2.0 POS will be enough to propel ETH to 5 digits alone whether this is a good or bad thing is another debate in of itself.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/wcamms32vqh71.png?width=1881&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1e0b067bcaae94c80fb6c4c3a8b63c7052a4816  https://preview.redd.it/74zr1o32vqh71.png?width=1895&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3b0a8f4b22364743a50e007bdfa4a5552df4548  https://preview.redd.it/lh1arw32vqh71.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=4248e6bd0ba1a270e655816f5034e4c04f67a42f  Now, we must also take into account that all this will be happening when there is record demand for access to the Ethereum blockchain for DeFi and NFT's. ETH is simply too important relative to BTC. Ethereum has flipped Bitcoin in every important metric, the last remaining metric is the market cap and that is only one 2.5x of Ethereum away.  But now you may ask, isn't this narrative already priced in? Well no, I don't believe so. The Triple Halving narrative only came into existence on April 27th (A 79 page investment report on why ETH could hit $150,000 by 2023 can be found on this link [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing) ) how many of you had even heard of the ETH triple halving before reading this post? The average person will have no clue what even an Ethereum is but almost everyone has heard of BTC. In the last cycle the world discovered BTC not ETH, this cycle the world will discover ETH. BTC's first mover advantage will only take it so far and over time will begin to mean less and less. The shifting narrative of BTC to ETH will come as a result of BTC failing to be environmentally friendly and BTC will always fail at this hurdle as well as the very limited utility of BTC. Another reason why its unlikely this has been priced in yet is the Bitcoin halving was never priced in even though people knew about it 4 years in advance and it always led to a 100x price increase.  Now we must also discuss some major reasons why this laid out foundation for the price of ETH to explode could be hindered. The journey for ETH will not be straight forward by any means and will likely be plagued by delays and many other unforeseen events.  * Scaling could fail to reduce fees - Adoption can be too fast or Optimism is delayed or not adopted quickly enough by the main gas consumers (Uniswap and Tether). * POS is delayed - This is ETH we are talking about and this scenario is very likely to happen. POS is scheduled for late 2021 but will more likely come in early 2022 * Transaction fees end up being so low that due to scaling or lack of usage (bear market) - If Ethereum scales too well, fee burns would not have such a big impact on price.  There are also some other issues that are less likely to occur such as a $10 Trillion market cap ETH could cause a regulatory risk as an unregulated decentralized entity being worth so much is a scary prospect for many governments to deal with.  TLDR: ETH is already beating BTC in almost every important metric except market cap, with the EIP-1559 update and upcoming transition to POS ETH will loses 90% of its sell pressure or the equivalent of three BTC halvings in the timespan of 12 months leading to a price explosion that some predict could hit $150,000 by 2023 ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing)).

That couldn't be further from the truth.  BSC is an Ethereum clone and all they did to reduce fees was increase the gas limit. That means that more transactions can be processed for lower fees but it requires more powerful hardware and thus more centralization. Ethereum could do this in 10 minutes if they thought that was beneficial to the network but they haven't because doing so would break a lot of the decentralization and security of the network.  Ethereum is so widely used and trusted **because** it is so decentralized and secure.  Ethereum has the most developers and researchers working on it than any other blockchain project by a very long way which means it is literally the bleeding edge of crypto tech. The Eth killers have a long way to go to knock it off as king of DeFi.  That's not to say that ADA and DOT aren't very promising projects but putting BSC/BNB in with them is almost laughable.

ETH,cryptocurrency,Why do people think that Cardano is faster than Ethereum?,"OK can we please have a technical discussion regarding the scalability of Cardano? Instead of the regular super highly upvoted moontalk (I know this thread will probably be downvoted to oblivion).  Cardano currently only handles 7 transactions per second on-chain. Ethereum currently handles 12-15 transactions per second on-chain. By tweaking some parameters in the future Cardano could potentially scale to 50 transactions per second on-chain which obviously still isn't enough for real world adoption. Cardano will scale off-chain with layer 2 solutions (Hydra). But they are awfully behind their competition in developing layer 2 support.  Don't take my word for it, even Cardano devs on their own subreddit admit all this.  See here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mxjf0w/psa\_cardano\_ada\_runs\_at\_seven\_7\_transactions\_per/](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mxjf0w/psa_cardano_ada_runs_at_seven_7_transactions_per/)  And here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/Cardano\_ELI5/comments/la7ptu/how\_many\_transactions\_per\_second\_tps\_can\_cardano/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/la7ptu/how_many_transactions_per_second_tps_can_cardano/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)  So why do so many people think that Cardano is faster than Ethereum?  Also, I made this same post intended to discuss the scalability of Cardano two days ago. It quickly rose into the top 50 posts until a bot deleted it from the frontpage stating ""there are already 2 posts about this coin in the top 50"". But guess what, there are always 2 non-critical moonboy posts about Cardano in the top 50. So it's very unfortunate that technical discussions about this coin have no place on [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/). I will therefore keep posting this daily, until the day a bot doesn't delete it.  Edit: Since this time, this post didn't get deleted, I will add this. I have nothing against Cardano. But I have noted that there currently exists a widespread lack of knowledge regarding the scalability of blockchains in general and Cardano in particular. This is an extremely hard technical problem that haven't been solved for over 10 years. Cardano is not offering a unique quick fix to this anytime in the near future. But I am happy that we now have more projects than ever (including Cardano) that are working on it.",2103,2021-05-30 23:49:00,925

In regular process, the gas limit used on the network is voted on by miners in coordination w/ core devs. The miners can vote on the protocol’s gas limit. In regular course, the miners are incentivised to act in the best interests of the protocol and retain this governance. However, with proof of stake merge cutting miners out, they are now acting in selfish interest.   However, EGL now seeks to bribe miners to tokenize & sell this control to the market instead, ignoring due process. Such a proposal will never pass EIP process, but now due to greedy miners this attempt at power grab is being played out.   Miners are taking this step because of the upcoming proof of stake merge, that threatens to cut miners out of the picture. Hence, they are attempting to divest their control on the network in this fashion, by selling their governance out in collaboration with some rogue VC funds, and trying to seek rent on the governance process.   The Ethereum team must make it clear that they don’t endorse this EGL project.

On the 30th june, the difficulty bomb will go off, gradually increasing the difficulty for miners to mine blocks.  The data can be found here:   Http://wenmerge.com  And in an as yet unspecified date in august, the real main net merge will happen.  So why am I so bullish about the merge?  Its largely Eth moving instantly from 3.3% inflation to -0.7% inflation. But it's also these.   1. 99% reduction in energy cost per Tx.  2. 90% issuance reduction.  12500 eth a day to 1250.  3. Miner sell pressure drops from 14,000 eth a day to 0.  4. More eth locked in the staking contract for 6 months after the merge .  5. Deflationary asset.  More eth burned than produced if gwei >20gwei.    Number 3 is I think the most important. While it wont drop to exactly 0 on the first night, removing $30 million of sell pressure per day will have a massive effect.  The market would need to refind this pressure just to stop the price going up. (Its guaranteed profit). It wont find this sell pressure.    There won't be a 'massive selloff' on merge night.  All eth remains locked into the contract until the next update.  After that, there is a queued release.   I believe that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are stores of value,  but Ethereum is currently also the worlds largest and most secure crypto network.  It is the foundation of web3.    As a final note, it took 19 months to get 12.6 million into the deposit contract.   In the last 2 months alone,  2.6 million of that amount was deposited.    As a final final note, I'd like to thank Do Kwon for causing the luna crash and allowing us to buy Eth this cheap, this close to the merge.  And also removing luna from the market and allowing Ethereum more room to grow in MC.  You're a bastard, make no mistake; but you're a magnificent one.

I'd personally love to see Ergo skyrocket, but it's only my early investor's hopium, ~~realistically I think that everybody will just switch to Bitcoin.~~  **EDIT: Someone just told me the difference between Bitcoin and GPU mining, so I edited the post :)**",1153,2021-12-21 13:06:12,1079

ETH,cryptocurrency,Jaredfromsubway is the biggest gas spender on Ethereum with over $70M spent,"I’m sure all of you have heard about Jaredfromsubway.eth and his infamous MEV bot which runs sandwich attacks.   He basically runs an MEV bot which runs 2 transactions before and after the original swap transaction of an unsuspecting user and end up making profit from the same by manipulating the price of the asset being swapped.   As per the analysis on dune by hildobby https://dune.com/hildobby/Gas?Timeframe=All+Time  He has now spent the most amount of gas in terms of ETH with over 37k ETH or $70M spent which puts his wallet ahead of the biggest exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, etc  If we look at it from a percentage perspective, he has spent more than 5% of the total gas being spent in the last 6 months.  Can you guess how much profit he would have made by spending almost $70M in gas?  Not-So-Fun Fact: Jaredfromsubway.eth gets his name from the former spokesperson for the fast food chain Subway who was convicted for child pornography and pedophilia and was sentenced to 15 years in prison back in 2015.",611,2023-09-09 14:14:21,594

ETH,cryptocurrency,Is Ethereum Still Worth the Investment? A deeper look.,"&#x200B;  ### Ethereum  2021 was a fantastic year for crypto, in particular Ethereum. Ethereum reigns as **the second-largest blockchain** despite the slew of competition from Binance SC, Solana, Avalanche. But it remains far ahead showcased by various metrics, and there are no signs of slowing down.  #### Total Value Locked  [*How to use TVL metrics*](https://medium.com/coinmonks/use-tvl-to-spot-the-next-hot-coin-crypto-market-update-12-28-dbae6020294a)  Ethereum ended 2021 with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $153 billion and contains nearly 60% of TVL in crypto. Its nearest competitor Terra (LUNA) TVL, sits at $13.3b with 7% of the market. Despite the hype following emerging L1s they remain far from the king.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/blud071uo4f81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e54dd093d848d7b55536a6f9daa638799116601     #### Revenue  Ethereum showcased impressive revenue in 2021 totaling $10.9b. The nearest L1 was BSC, which edged on $1.0b of revenue. There are four projects on Ethereum that post larger revenue than BSC. (Filecoin, Axie, Opensea, Uniswap)  Opensea, an NFT marketplace on Ethereum, saw a revenue of $1.5b in 2021 with the emergence of NFTs.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/kkgktdovo4f81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fc1a89d4b528841edba4038faf655798a8dc158     #### Layer 2s on Ethereum  Layer 2 protocols are taking traction, benefitting from Ethereum’s **reliability and security**. In the future, Ethereum may be a consensus layer for an extensive array of layer 2s that inherit low gas fees and fast TPS speeds.  Some top names are Polygon (MATIC), Optimism, Arbitrum, Loopring (LRC), and ZkSync.  #### Creator Earnings  Typically, creators on centralized networks like YouTube, Spotify, Etsy, and OnlyFans, only capture a portion of the revenue they create. As the creator economy on Ethereum begins to evolve, many creators will start to see the benefits of capturing a larger percentage of value utilizing a decentralized network. NFTs for artists is a prime example. Ethereum, as a whole, competes with prominent names in creator economies.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/bj90vk8xo4f81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=14b7da6a2f6ce455e71cba02cdddbd46535a31c1     #### Eth Burning and Deflationary Pressures  EIP — 1559 upgrade has been burned 1.7 million ETH  at a valuation of $4.6 billion since early Aug 2021. Before EIP-1559, all ETH would remain on the network. Now, supply decreases with every transaction.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/p137lguyo4f81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=177950e27231b4b6e071da3636bd78f1faa1757a   Even though Ethereum remains inflationary, the increasing demand sees days of negative issuance. With ETH continuously being locked away, bought for speculation, and utilized for gas fees, Ethereum’s deflationary pressures will exceed new supply.   &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/b9548ab0p4f81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=33d952ac0f6b1adc67a4015195e051ad01038bfd  &#x200B;     #### Conclusion  Ethereum remains far ahead of its competition in almost all metrics. [Moreover, it attracted the highest number of developers in 2021](https://medium.com/coinmonks/electric-capital-developer-report-recap-where-are-the-crypto-developers-going-and-why-its-3855aa5dd1d8) that continue to build the ecosystem.  There are a few negatives for Ethereum, no doubt. Ethereum is slow, and gas fees are incredibly high. In addition, environmental mandates are beginning to add pressure to the “proof of work” consensus. But, Ethereum contains scheduled upgrades that will improve speed, lower gas fees, and see a switch to an eco-friendly “proof of stake.” Ethereum Consensus Network (formerly Eth 2.0) will be near completion in approximately one year.  So, what are we left with?  * The largest and fastest-growing ecosystem in crypto *  Significant deflationary pressures * The emergence of Layer 2 options  *  Dwindling supply *  Hammered down ETH prices *  Upcoming improvement upgrades to the network *  The emergence of creator economy (NFTS, DAOs, music, writers, games)  [It’s no wonder Cathie Wood and her team of quants forecast an ETH price of 180k by 2030](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cathie-wood%3A-ethereum-will-reach-%2420-trillion-market-cap-by-2030).  2022 will be an important year for [Ethereum upgrades](https://etherworld.co/2021/12/02/ethereums-latest-roadmap/). In the past, upgrades are often delayed and I expect no different this time. But, the process seldom detriments the network. So…  At its current price of $2680, Ethereum could be a complete steal, **and far as the risk/reward ratio, it remains one of the best crypto investments**.  &#x200B;     ### Gabi  *Follow me on*  [*Medium*](https://medium.com/@TraderGabi) *or subscribe to this FREE daily newsletter on* [*Substack*](https://tradergabi.substack.com/) *to receive it first!*",1203,2022-02-01 01:59:51,709
