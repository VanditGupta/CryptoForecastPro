XRP,cryptocurrency,Convince me that Ripple (XRP) is not a Ponzi Scheme…,"Out of all the big players in the crypto landscape, Ripple stands out to me as a Charlatan.  A for profit company that is trying to get banks and central banks to adopt its currency. Banks and central banks will be the last to adopt crypto and will only adopt something that the masses use.  This company only has a billion dollars in cash, has 1100 employees, and the rest of its assets, purportedly 25 billion, is in mostly ripple.  So essentially anytime the price goes up they are incentivized to sell Ripple from the balance sheet to help cover cost. What I don’t get is the ripple market cap is suppose to be 27 billion on top of all this per coin-market-cap.  What am I missing here?",307,2024-07-01 07:08:59,585
XRP,cryptocurrency,Why Ripple's XRP is poised for $10,"I will present the case why XRP will re-enter price discovery this year due to the very bullish chart structure. I believe that XRP is imitating Bitcoin's previous cycle from 2018-2021. Of course, this is not financial advice, you must proceed at your own caution and exercise appropriate risk management but I wanted to share my thoughts.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/rsiesesy7vsc1.png?width=1593&format=png&auto=webp&s=918f22ab28ac6db98f6a9d4705e8e5e42c59de47  The image is the Bitcoin price chart during the last cycle. We see Bitcoin crash to 3k in 2018, followed by a retrace to the 0.618 retracement to 14k in 2019, then re-accumulation back down to the lows in early 2020 followed by price expansion, almost reaching a full 4.236 extension in 2021.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/wju0aun18vsc1.png?width=1581&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b50d93e9f28ef43bb1520d239cc399650e0b18  This image is the XRP price chart. XRP is showing a similar structure to Bitcoin's previous cycle but just behaving much more slowly which is why most people think the project is dead, retail investors don't have much patience. We observe that XRP crashed to $0.11 in 2020, then retraced to around the 0.618 at $2 in 2021, followed by re-accumulation in 2022-23 and now I believe we are about to enter the price expansion phase. If XRP was achieve a full 4.236 extension like bitcoin, then the target would be above $10.  Both the structure of bitcoin and XRP show: crash, retrace, re-accumulation and now price expansion.  However, I would like to offer some balance as well and want to re-iterate that XRP must break the 2021 high of $2 to show confirmation of an uptrend. Otherwise, it may make another lower high and that would cause XRP to deviate away from what BTC did last cycle. This bullish thesis hinges on XRP being able to break that 2021 high, so pay close attention to that.  I also believe that 2024 will be make or break for XRP. As I expect the inevitable hard landing of the US economy in the second half of this year. It's pretty much now or never for coins like XRP. If it is unable to do anything meaningful this year, I will have to conclude the project is dead because once the macro conditions turns ugly, there is no chance for any crypto to do well in that environment. The stock market is the force that drives crypto bull runs. However, I remain hopeful that we get our XRP bull run this year.  Most people on this subreddit hate XRP which is again another reason to be bullish. The herd of retail investors is generally wrong. They all expected 100k in 2021, they all thought crypto died in 2022, they all expected 12k in 2023, they hated Solana at the lows...the list is endless. When has the herd of retail investors ever been right about anything? Now they all expect the bull run to last until late 2025 lmao.  I am a firm believer of ""show me the chart and I will tell you the news"", so I am expecting some bullish narrative to emerge for XRP, who knows. Regardless, I think we can all agree that 2024 will be pivotal for coins like XRP. Look forward to hearing your thoughts!  Edit: Wow so much negativity. The more you insult XRP, the higher it will go. I didn't make the rules. It's just how the universe works.",0,2024-04-06 14:01:44,180
XRP,cryptocurrency,XRP Price On The Brink Of Another Breakout: The 'Game-Changing Implications' Of Ripple's RLUSD Mints,,182,2024-12-03 21:13:38,187
XRP,cryptocurrency,Ripple (XRP) is a different animal compared to other cryptos,"Since XRP is quite old by today's standards, many people believe and trade it like any other crypto. But XRP has a complete different approach to the technology and should be therefore also treated differently.  Ripple is not only a chain, but has a for profit corporation behind it. Its business model is based on fiat to fiat money transfer with XRP as an intermediate token. For this to properly work the price of the coin is irrelevant, but its liquidity is important. To achieve this, the Ripple Corporation can mint and burn XRP on it own as they seem fit.  People buying just the token are just getting the excess the corporation does not use anymore. On the other hand, the Ripple Corporation is directly funded through these sales. But once they are sold, they have no value to the business model. They don't need to buy some for liquidity, they can just mint some more. To be more clear, by buying XRP one does not participate in the success of Ripple just funding their operations. Quite some one sided business.  To answer some obvious questions: the time frame for the fiat to fiat transfer is short enough, so that price changes for XRP are irrelevant. Blockchain technology is used for having a ledger that holds all transactions in a simple and seamless way. It is also obvious that the corporation has no interest in decentralization or development of its chain technology. Naturaly, its business model creates some serious volume on the chain which may make it look like being ""legit"".  If do not want to fund this corporation without benefits, then you probably don't want to trade XRP.",0,2024-07-17 19:54:31,50
XRP,cryptocurrency,Why do people still invest in XRP?,"Genuine question. It has been an under performer since the high in the 2017 bull run, since then it hasn’t been able to make new highs. The btc/xrp chart is literally down on Btc after 10 years, ripple labs is known to continuously unload tokens onto the market keeping the price down.  I was heavily invested in 2018-2019 when I entered the market but then ended up selling it all into eth which was a really great move, since then I haven’t looked back.   Why do you guys still believe in xrp?? I don’t get it, it’s never a good sign when a coin can’t break its previous highs in a bull run. And you can’t entirely blame that on the SEC case, even without it I don’t think it would’ve gone much higher as payment solutions was not a narrative that got much attention that cycle.. and this cycle coming up I just don’t see people coming in getting hyped about xrp.  It just doesn’t stand out in any facet and I argue its time in the top 10 is coming to an end, it’s still hovering around the same price it was over 5 years ago when I entered the market. You’d be better off with most stocks at this point. what is the reason you’d pick xrp as an investment?? I just get so confused when people still think it’s a good addition to a portfolio  Edit: I actually agree with the people saying this sub is like the best reverse-indicator and I've used it before on the Solana bottom when it was being fudded hard by this sub. That being said I've heard 100s of 'XRP to the moon next week!' or 'SWIFT adoption $589 XRP in 1 month!' videos over the last 5 years and XRP has never performed, I actually hope you XRP holders are right and it moons.. I just don't see it. I'll revisit this later on in the bull market and lets see how XRP has faired to the rest of the market. It will go up with the rest of the market for sure, like it always does. I just think it will be an under-performer compared to other coins. Good luck XRP army! I'm not a hater just think it's a bad pick for a bull market",618,2024-01-31 00:23:04,589
XRP,cryptocurrency,Ripple is funding propaganda against Bitcoin by teaming up with the government to spread energy FUD,"Ripple labs has been funding ""research"" along with government entities to spread propaganda against Bitcoin and mining.   In 2021, they funded a hit piece that claims energy prices for consumers in New York has increased by $6 per month because of mining.   [Claim: Mining drives up household electricity bills](https://preview.redd.it/m0ta2tae4xb81.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=8079d16b0fde7bc74ebd204d4362ff823da26d3f)  Surely its not the soaring costs of natural gas that is driving up electricity prices, but mining?   [Since June 2020, Natural gas prices have gone up by 350&#37; in the USA \(Henry Hub natural gas futures rolling contracts\)](https://preview.redd.it/iprxvhfj5xb81.jpg?width=2610&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4da2516b82eb585706d4d1af417320b5b82889e)  [Not just in USA, in UK, natural gas is at decadal highs. ](https://preview.redd.it/v2gl6rmx3xb81.jpg?width=3094&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dae03fee6dfbbfaf58df82519db809462d01254)  Surely, electricity prices that consumers pay have nothing whatsoever to do with inflation, or soaring gas prices that are in decadal highs.. but is due to bitcoin mining?!  Crude oil WTI futures are currently at 84, for comparison it was around 56 in Nov 2019 (pre pandemic). The last time WTI was above 80 was all the way back in 2014. Increasing crude oil natural gas prices, along with inflation that is at multi-decade high is not the reason for increase in household electricity, but its bitcoin mining that is responsible..   [Thats according to this study funded by Ripple in collusion with the Department of Treasury. ](https://preview.redd.it/a4z5aqnyaxb81.jpg?width=1944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6656489541bece07a0e9b83837d42345157f987c)... The same Department of Treasury headed by another well known Bitcoin hater Janet Yellen, who earned $7m as ""speaking fee"" from the same banks she is supposed to regulate but has tried to stifle Bitcoin and crypto at every opportunity.   Research with ""financial support"" is nothing but propaganda, especially when it's funded by a competitor to bitcoin that lobbies with the government. Ripple continues to be a centralised premine scam created to enrich its founders.   Ripple has also cozied up with the likes of WEF, the very organisations Bitcoin was created as a fuck you to. [https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple](https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple)  As its price and narrative around the shitcoin has stagnated, Ripple is resorting to dirty political tricks to get a leg up. As usual, they will fail.   The narrative that bitcoin mining companies cause increase in electricity bills in NY is rubbish, as the largest BTC mining companies in New York produce their own energy. Infact the last one to start mining in NY is a hydro electric plant that was unused for years, before they started mining Bitcoin last year.   [https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php)  The other large mining company Greenidge Generation also produces its own energy.   Edit: Buttcoin losers in comments say ""reee bitcoin move to POS or govt will ban it""  Yeah not too bright, the whole point of Bitcoin is that it cant be banned unlike the proof of stake shitcoins you support that can be created out of thin air at the press of a button and shut down at the press of a button.  Another one who is literally a war monger calling for Ukraine invasion but pretends to care about global e-waste. Lmao. Bitcoin haters are really a funny bunch   Edit: Ripple shills keep brigading and claiming where is the paper, of course if you are as bricked as a ripple fan boy you need to be spoon fed everything. Well here is the paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779720  And if you open up the first page of it, says  > **Benetton and Compiani acknowledge financial support from Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative.**  i.e this whole ""paper"" is nothing but a hit piece propaganda sponsored by a competitor  The other writer of this paper is Adiar Morse, who conveniently works for the Dept of Treasury under Yellen:   https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/prof-adair-morse-joins-biden-administration-as-a-treasury-department-deputy/  Seems like natural career progression - collect funds from Ripple to publish propaganda against Bitcoin, and get hired by Yellen who has been promoting propaganda against crypto for years now. Nothing to see here.  Final Edit: Jjust look at the number of freshly created ""Tin"" accounts that have popped up in the comments to shill for XRP. Didnt realize 2017 left so many bag holders. It must be real miserable with these heavy bags that are at 1/3rd of their 2017 ATH, while almost every other coin has gone up hundreds of % and made new highs this cycle. Thats what happens when you become exit liquidity for mccaleb, garlinghouse etc.   Lol at the shills shouting ""REEE ripple is a company XRP is decentralised token"". They really did you good with this one small trick.  Thats also the reason garlinhouse drives a shiny car while you are down 50% on your shitcoin investment.   The D in XRP stands for decentralised. It was always a premined scam token and will always be one. Thousands of tin bagholders wont change this.",3879,2022-01-15 22:15:00,2654

XRP,cryptocurrency,Charles from cardano was right. You need ripple to win or this lawsuit. The SEC is going to open up CoinMarketCap and start litigating down the list. Do not let tribalism get in the way of this.,"By winning the suit against ripple and the execs (for anyone who’s been following the suit ripple are absolutely smashing it) there will be case precedent.   They will have the big fish and case law.  This means any ico or sale of crypto from the inventors of said crypto will be targeted. There’s one thing the SEC likes and that is money.   They can see an untapped wealth of fines and settlements here and they want to be the regulator who controls crypto in the USA. You might hate Xrp, but right now ripple and their lawyers are preventing the SEC from getting their hands on the crypto market.  I have been following this case very very closely, the BtC Is The BesT tHe ResT aRe ShiTcOinS mentality is fcking stupid. If you cannot see what the SEC is trying to do here then good luck. Legit good fcking luck. EVERYONE should be paying very close attention to their strategy I KNOW those who are launching ICO's and have done in the past are and are seeking legal advice.

XRP,cryptocurrency,XRP got much more love than they deserve - Ripple is heavily centralized and fights real decentralization in the crypto space,"During the SEC lawsuit, I have noticed XRP getting a lot of love from the crypto community, and I can understand this. The SEC was never only going against Ripple as we have seen this year, so this entire lawsuit was somehow representative for all of crypto.  However now that things are somehow settled, we should face reality: XRP is just another heavily centralized project, no matter if it's a security or not. The consensus mechanism is literally proof of trust - The network runs on a bunch of bank owned servers, relying on all participants being doxxed. This is not innovative blockchain tech, this is the same old banking system using ""blockchain"" as a marketing term.  I could live with that alone or ignore it at least - XRP it's by far not the only centralized cryptocurrency. However Ripple has also done their best in the past to fight real decentralized cryptos like BTC and ETH:  They often attack BTC, for example Ripple CFO claimed BTC is controlled by China in 2020 ([source](https://gizmodo.com/ripple-claims-bitcoin-is-chinese-controlled-while-annou-1845932148)). The same claims were made against Ethereum according to Vitalik Buterin ([source](https://zycrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-faults-ripples-decentralization-claim-says-the-platform-is-completely-centralized/)), for which they never apologized.  Also most of you probably remember they funded a FUD energy campaign that tried to push Bitcoin towards PoS ([source](https://decrypt.co/96298/ripple-co-founder-backs-controversial-campaign-change-bitcoin-code)).  &#x200B;  At this point people should really think twice if that's a project they want to support just because there is some bullish outlook after they won the case.

Even though you can theoretically run your own validator, it doesn't make much sense unless Ripple Labs approves it. Otherwise, you will not be included in anyone's list of trusted validators and no one will take you seriously.  It turns out that Ripple Labs is essentially the central bank of this system. And XRP is its CBDC.  Ripple aims not to change the current fiat system, but, on the contrary, to sustain its existence. Ripple is the evil twin of Bitcoin.

XRP,cryptocurrency,The SEC’s Window to File an Appeal in the Ripple Case has Officially Closed For Years,"I think everyone here saw the news that the SEC was planning to appeal the summary judgement ruling handed down from Judge Torres on Friday. The whole thing started when the SEC filed documents in the Do Kwon case that read as below:  “The SEC respectfully avers that Ripple conflicts with and adds baseless requirements to Howey and it’s progeny. Respectfully, those portions of Ripple were wrongfully decided, and the court should not follow them.”  I mean what else are they gonna say? Of course they disagree with the ruling. But, as many pro-crypto lawyers have pointed out, if the SEC loses an appeal then it becomes binding case law for trial judges. This would be disastrous for their plans to bring the crypto market into “compliance”.   Anyhow, The SEC had until midnight to file an interlocutory appeal. An interlocutory appeal is basically an appeal before final judgment on some aspects of the ruling. They’re rarely filed and even more rarely accepted.  They didn’t file one, which means they must wait until final judgment from the jury trial to file an appeal unless there is a settlement. Ripple’s CEO has said that the trial could take years.   TL;DR  The SEC’s window to file an interlocutory appeal in the Ripple case has ended. They must now wait until the jury trial is finished to file an appeal which could take years according to Ripple’s CEO.

XRP,cryptocurrency,"The SEC is going after Coinbase now. First it was Ripple and all of us laughed. Now it is Coinbase, Next it could be us.","The SEC is suing Coinbase over its Lend product that pays out interest to asset holders. This is appalling, because it is something that the banks that the SEC protects will never be able to do - give actual returns to user’s assets, not the 0.05% interest pittance that is dished out to users by banks.   Somehow, the big brains at SEC, well funded by tax payers, have now come up with legal arguments as to why giving retail end users a decent interest rate is a crime and securities fraud. 🤯  The regulators never act in the interest of retail users, mom and pop investors and regular folk. They simply exist to protect the rights of the banking and securities cartel. There never was any investigation into dark pools, naked shorts by hedge funds, trading restrictions and manipulation by the big players. Instead, the SEC even made rules that now prevent retail from buying shares in companies they own. Basically legitimising Robinhood’s tactics.   Even right now, there are more GME shares held by institutions than the total shares outstanding. So many counterfeit shares. Over the last week, shares of defunct companies like Blockbuster and Sears have surged 1000%... these are companies that are already bankrupt and in liquidation, but somehow a well regulated SEC monitored market still allows Blockbuster to rise 1500%.  The SEC is utterly incompetent and exists only to harass retail and prevent small time investors from making it big  Coinbase CEO Brain Armstrong put out a message just now :   “Some really sketchy behavior coming out of the SEC recently. Story time…Millions of crypto holders have been earning yield on their assets over the last few years. It makes sense, if you want to lend out your funds, you can earn a return. Everyone seems happy. A bunch of great companies in crypto have been offering versions of this for years. Coinbase came out recently and said we would be launching our own version....  They responded by telling us this lend feature is a security. Ok - seems strange, how can lending be a security? So we ask the SEC to help us understand and share their view. We always make an effort to work proactively with regulators, and keep an open mind.”  Tl DR: the SEC refused to meet either Coinbase, saying they don’t meet crypto companies. But prefer regulation by litigation approach.   These are not the actions of an regulatory agent acting in good faith.",575,2021-09-08 04:02:05,233

XRP,cryptocurrency,Update in the SEC vs ripple labs case. The SEC is refusing to hand over documents in regards to their internal trading policies. Even after being ordered by the judge….twice.,"What you are seeing here is elite corruption at its highest level. The SEC is refusing to hand over internal trading policies in regards to staff and their holdings of securities.  Basically the SEC allowed staff to own Xrp up until 2018/2019. They emailed 3rd party investors (you and me) in late 2020 and stated they had not made a determination on Xrp’s security status.  Yet they are suing ripple, Brad and Chris for breaking securities laws from……2013. There is a hearing coming up in regards to these documents…..again.   The SEC is nothing but a gangster organisation who litigate for fines which is their source of revenue. The Ripple lawsuit has given the public a look behind closed doors to see how utterly corrupt they are.  Like Elon said on 60 mins  “I have no respect for the SEC”",645,2021-08-28 05:41:15,180

XRP,cryptocurrency,"Ripple’s XRP soars 30% - why you should be supporting Ripple, regardless of your opinion on XRP","I’m sure most of you here have seen XRP’s staggering performance today. The reason for this post is because most people on this sub dislike XRP due to its centralised nature. However, the following reason - in my opinion - is why everyone should be cheering for Ripple in the ongoing lawsuit, no matter your opinion on XRP.  Let’s face it, XRP holders have had a rough few years after the lawsuit was announced in December 2020. However, as the years have gone on, we have seen countless amazing projects enter and drop out of the top 10 - Chainlink, Monero, Tezos - to name a few. Guess which coin has amazingly retained its top 10 spot, despite having the SEC on its back? You guessed it: XRP.  Regardless of whether you hold, love or hate XRP, Ripple are doing what pretty much all of us would love to do, and that’s give a huge middle finger to the SEC. One must realise that an SEC victory will put so many other projects under scrutiny, and this will not favour crypto well as a whole. We will witness many of our favourite projects being placed under the microscope of the regulators. However, if the lawsuit ends with a Ripple victory, it may potentially set up crypto for a (mini) bull run, as regulators are forced to lay off as we see some sort of regulatory clarity in our beloved industry. The crypto industry as a whole is likely to piggy-back off the success of the lawsuit, should we see a favourable victory. No one wants to be in Ripple’s position, but I’m sure we can all appreciate that Ripple has taken one for the team and is fighting one of the most important battles - not just for themselves, but for the entire crypto industry.  Tldr: FUCK THE SEC",122,2023-03-21 21:26:02,305

XRP,cryptocurrency,"XRP news abound this week! Former Ripple chair Barr Confirmed as new Fed Chief, Judge Netburn named the SEC 'hypocrites' in ruling, McCaleb (XLM) dumping nearly done. Whew!","My goodness friends, what a week for Ripple. XRP holders, catalysts abound yet we remain stuck in by the bears. Let's do a quick recap anyway, and hope that the market begins to reflect the bullish news:  Michael Barr Confirmed: Michael Barr, a former Ripple adviser, is set to assume one of the most important U.S. regulatory roles after winning Senate confirmation to be vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve. Barr is considered an ally to crypto, but has tempered his sentiments with expectations that the market be regulated robustly. This appointment is widely considered good for crypto, and considering it's issues with the SEC - good for Ripple.  Netburn says 'the Hinman emails must be produced': The long awaited ruling has finally come down from Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn regarding the attorney-client privilege of conversations had with SEC lawyers by William Hinman. Judge Netburn unequivocally ruled in favor of Ripple, even slamming the 'hypocrisy' of the SEC in its attempted defense - asserting that the SEC isn't even attempting to follow the law in good faith. In his now infamous speech Hinman said that Bitcoin and Ethereum were not to be considered securities, despite ETH having conducted the same kind of unregistered token offerings as Ripple. The preperatory emails Hinman exchanged with SEC lawyers have been desperately guarded to this point, and it remains to be seen what the SEC will do. It seems likely that there will be a series of appeals to Judge Analise Torres, who is responsible for ruling on any appeals to Judge Netburn's decisions.  Jed's dead baby: Former Ripple CTO Jed McCaleb is almost done selling his 9 billion XRP after nearly 8 years. Jed left Ripple after having differences with the leadership team on the direction of the project there. Jed has since worked to bring Stellar (XLM) into the crypto space as a competitor to Ripple within the global payment settlement industry. It is believed that Jed has nearly completed selling his stack of XRP, (he holds approximately 10 million in his TacoStand account) which is estimated to be gone by weeks end. XRP fans are ecstatic about this, as the downward selling pressure has been significant from McCaleb for nearly a decade.  Other notes: Did you know that Ripple only controls about 5% of nodes on the XRPL? XRP is more decentralized than many crypto projects. The community drives most innovations on chain as well, and will soon deliver Smart Contracts to XRPL in a 100% community driven effort, minus any Ripple devs. Congrats!  Much to be excited for if you hold a bag of XRP. Thanks for reading!",319,2022-07-14 12:37:42,223

XRP,cryptocurrency,Ripple lawyer accuses SEC of intentional delay lawsuit,"One of the top lawyers in the Ripple (XRP) camp, Stuart Alderoty, recently lashed out at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Twitter. According to Alderoty, the SEC would deliberately try to delay the lawsuit between themselves and Ripple as long as possible.  &#x200B;  **Ripple lawsuit**  Ripple, meanwhile, has been embroiled in an infamous lawsuit with the US SEC for over a year. The SEC accuses Ripple of selling securities in the past without the necessary licenses. At the moment, Ripple is hopeful that the lawsuit will soon come to an end and the judge will finally issue a ruling. However, Alderoty lashed out at the SEC on Twitter. He believes that the SEC does not want the court case to end any time soon.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/jisowqdswhb81.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e9c680ce369d60ff1003268f0fa06d86912468a  **Gary Gensler**  In the series of Twitter messages, Alderoty responds to a message from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Gensler revealed why, in his opinion, enforcement of rules is one of the SEC's most important tasks. Soccer without referees would turn into an unfair occupation in no time according to Gensler. If teams don't have to worry about penalties and enforcement of the rules, things will go wrong. The same goes for the markets, according to Gensler.   &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/dmwxeixuwhb81.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ef5caa037c3fe6e1f067f0eed849ae04b274c14  Alderoty argues that the SEC is guilty of ""regulation by enforcement."" That by simply initiating a lawsuit against an entity they are trying to control certain markets. This is also why, according to Alderoty, the SEC does not seem to be in any particular hurry in the lawsuit.  &#x200B;  Ripple's CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, still seemed convinced in November of last year that the lawsuit will end this year. In addition, he is hopeful that the judge's ruling will also be in Ripple's favor.",346,2022-01-13 18:08:40,228

XRP,cryptocurrency,"My efforts for mass adoption: I'm building a crypto to fiat point of sale app and payment platform. Supporting Nano, Stellar Lumens and Ripple payments to USD and AUD (initially). Your feedback is greatly appreciated.","I very much believe that cryptocurrencies will be adopted by the masses in the future however I also believe that a series of gradual transitions need to occur rather than a mass takeover. The majority of merchants are simply not ready or willing to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. There are several reasons for this including obvious volatility issues, difficulty in liquidating crypto assets, ongoing changes to regulation, taxation issues and the general negative or uninformed perception of cryptocurrencies.   In an ideal world we as consumers should be able to choose which currencies we trade with, while merchants should be able to receive the currencies that work for their businesses. The platform I’m building caters for currency agnostic transactions for point of sale using mobile apps (web based crypto-fiat payments will follow soon after). I believe this interim approach leads to several benefits:   *	Consumers can spend their crypto immediately without having to convert to fiat first. There are potential tax implications here.  *	Merchants don’t need to worry about volatility, however they can still accept cryptocurrencies for the benefit of their customers.  *	There are no fees to be paid by merchants for payment processing.  *	Rewards (Liquidium Tokens) will be given to both merchants and consumers for using the services. This will incentivize both parties to spend crypto as spending leads to the earning of tokens.  *	Anybody with a bank account can be a merchant. This is to be used by individuals and businesses to facilitate crypto to fiat payments.  So far the platform can accept Nano, Ripple, Stellar Lumens and soon, Liquidium (LQM). Liquidium is a token based on the Stellar network. These tokens will be used for transactions and rewards and since it’s based on Stellar, all transactions are quick to settle.   I understand there are many projects focusing on crypto payments but it seems like most projects that started as ICOs are focusing on pushing their own token / coin rather than enabling crypto payments for all cryptocurrencies suitable for cheap and timely transactions.   To prove I’m not full of shit, [here is a brief demo of the app](https://youtu.be/Ft6ku1s8sTg) actually working (functionality and design subject to change between now and the release). We currently have a few businesses testing the system in the real world. Open beta testing invites will take place soon.  Any input is much appreciated. This will be released soon and I'd like to appeal to as wide an audience as possible.  I have set up a subreddit [/r/liquidium](https://np.reddit.com/r/liquidium) if you’d like to keep track of the project or ask questions. We’ll be looking for early adopters in the near future.
