USDT,cryptocurrency,What's the situation with Tether?,"Are the printed Tether USD backed up legit? I haven't read any news lately ever since there was a controversy around it.

This question came back to me because there's a correlation between the recent BTC price surge and and total market cap of Tether.

Just asking a legit question, don't want to spoil anyone having fun and dopamine hits with the recent start of bull run.


To add to the question.. What's weird this time around is that dumb meme coins started pumping first. In previous bull runs, memecoins mooning was usually a indicator of bull run comming to an end.

**Backstory** : There was a coup in Myanmar(Burma) in February 2021. 99 percent of the national loathes the military. As of now there are two governments

1. The military regime (Holding power)
2. The exiled government (won the 2021 election, the cabinet members location unknown but rumoured to be in Thailand,Germany,US)[Daily Fights going on - guerrilla warfare, daily protests, civil strike, tons of atrocities committed by the regime](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/11/1105082)To read [about the coup](https://www.nytimes.com/article/myanmar-news-protests-coup.html)

Since the Military is in control, the junta has tight control over the banks and the internet. Everything is traceable so the government in exile has announced the news today to encourage people to start using USDT instead of the current official Myanmar Currency (KYAT).[Link to the announcement](https://www.facebook.com/MoPFINUG/photos/a.114937487404692/251267307105042)

USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether has not reported its supply for 3 days now. Its supply has also fell 8B in the 5 days before that.,"Tether is usually reports its supply on their official website once every day, at an inconsistent time. That's why you can see stairs like this on a market cap chart:

[Tether market cap in the past 7 days - not counting the depeg it's the same as the supply](https://preview.redd.it/dymvdlxi03091.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&s=098410d180c50328cbe0103ebc98317c3d72f917)

If you go to their website you can see their current circulating supply with the same latency:

[The last update date is not true - it's actually May 14 and the supply exactly the same as it was 3 days ago](https://preview.redd.it/1vtvjvqez2091.png?width=1298&format=png&auto=webp&s=390553ce99b2cdb44d12eb745cf9b3505c77c9aa)

So they're not only not reporting the supply, but they're also lying about updating it. The only reason why would they do that is because their supply fell significantly in these 3 days and they don't want more people to follow. If they didn't hide the 8B that dropped during 5 days, how much are they hiding from these 3 days?

Tether is getting more and more shady with everyday. They will probably try to buy back some of the withdrawn Tether with their reserves, decreasing their actual reserves and shooting themselves in the foot further. Of course Tether collapsing is not a good thing, many people will lose their money and a crypto crash will follow. Under any circumstances, don't hold Tether.",4116,2022-05-17 18:46:26,1180

USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether explains how it is able to maintain its peg on their official website. Spoiler alert: They don't explain anything,"Tether's official website released an article named ""How Tether USD₮ Is Able to Maintain Its Peg When Other Stablecoins Fall"". So, there should be a professional explanation about their reserves? Nope.

The entire article is pretty much useless:

>Given the recent losses UST investors suffered, many users may be questioning if they can trust Tether USD₮ given the spectacular collapse of UST.   
>  
>Thankfully, all one needs to do is look at the history and track record of Tether USD₮.   
>  
>Tether USD₮ has been relied on as the primary form of dollar-based liquidity in the crypto market for many years and the crypto market has not been without its share of dramatic crashes! 

Like, what is this? They are saying they should be trusted entirely based on their track record, with no other explanation whatsoever??

&#x200B;

The first half of the page is useless, so what about the second half? 

The second half of the article is titled ""How Does an Algorithmic Stablecoin Work?"" and it's ALL they are talking about. 

>While UST is referred to as a stablecoin, it has nothing in common with collateralized stablecoins like Tether USD₮. UST is an algorithmic stablecoin. 

Again, they are using UST as a scapegoat instead of addressing their reserves or any explanation of how they maintain their peg.

Bloomberg has just published a detailed article trying to ideintify the source of the $69 Billion backing Tether, only to conclude that they have not been able to identify the money.

The only source who would speak to Bloomberg is the person running Deltec bank in Bahamas, who could account for around 1/4th of Tether's money (around $15 BN) but stayed coy when quizzed on the other money.

Tether has never tried to explain where exactly their money is stashed. If their statements are true, they would be the world's 7th largest commercial paper holder, with almost $30 bn in this..but no one in wall street has heard of them.

All of this unfolded over the last few months, but just few hours ago the CEO of Tether has deleted his twitter account.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Understanding Tether: Why it accounts for a substantial part of the crypto market cap and why its the #1 outstanding issue in crypto markets today,"In this post I will go in-depth on:

1. How Tether got to be what it is today

2. Why Tether's market cap is a lot more than 0.5% of the total market cap for crypto you see on CoinMarketCap

3. Tether printing timing

4. Tether reserves

5. What could happen to the market if Tether is found to not be backed by reserves

Tether is incredibly important to the cryptocurrency market ecosystem and I've noticed far too few people understand what is going on. 

Very little actual discussion of the 2nd biggest crypto by volume happens here and whenever someone starts a discussion they most often got slapped for ""FUD"". Tether themselves recently hired the major New York based PR firm 5W to spread positive information online and take down critics, I'm sure some of their operatives are probably on Reddit.

But its absolutely critical you understand the risks behind Tether and especially now with the explosion in reserve liability, breakdown in relationship with banks and their auditor and recently announced subpoena. 


#What exactly is Tether and what happened so far?

Tether is a cryptocurrency asset issued by Tether Limited (incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and a sister company of Bitfinex), on top of the Bitcoin blockchain through the Omni Protocol Layer. It is meant to give people a ""stablecoin"", for example a merchant who accepts bitcoin but fears its volatility could shift bitcoin into tether, which can be easier to do than exchanging bitcoin for dollars. Recently they've also added an Ethereum-based ERC20 token. Tether Ltd claims that each one of the tokens issued is backed by actual US dollar (and more recently Euro) reserves. The idea is that when a business partner deposits US dollars in Tether’s bank account, Tether creates a matching amount of tokens and transfers them to that partner, it is NOT a fractional reserve system.

Tether makes the two following key promises in its whitepaper on which the entire premise is build:

> Each tether issued will be backed by the equivalent amount of currency unit (one USDTether equals
one dollar).

>Professional auditors will regularly verify, sign, and publish our underlying bank balance and financial transfer statement.

Tether is centralized and dependent on your trust of Bitfinex/Tether Limited, and that the people behind it are honest people. For the new entrants to this market it will be greatly beneficial understand the timeline of Tether and their connection to Bitfinex.

A brief timeline:

* Bitfinex operators Phil Potter and CFO Giancarlo Devasini set up Tether Limited in the British Virgin Islands, but told the public that Bitfinex and Tether are completely separate. Throughout 2015 and 2016, the amount of Tether stays relatively flat.

* In August 2nd, 2016, the second-largest digital currency exchange heist in history happened, when Bitfinex lost nearly 120,000 bitcoin. Bitfinex never revealed full details of the hack, but BitGo (the security company that had to sign off on the transactions) claims its servers were not breached.  

* Just 4 days after the hack Bitfinex “socializes” its losses from the theft by announcing a 36 percent haircut for almost all of its customers. In return, customers receive BFX tokens, initially valued at $1 each. 

* Two weeks after the hack Bitfinex announces it has hired Ledger Labs, to investigate the theft and perform a financial audit of its cryptocurrency and fiat assets. The public nevers sees the results of the investigation, and months later, Bitfinex admits it never actually hired Ledger Labs to perform an audit to begin with.   

* In May 2017, after long standing calls for an actual audit, Bitfinex hires Friedman LLP to ""complete a comprehensive balance sheet audit.""

* November 7, 2017: Leaked documents dubbed “Paradise Papers” reveal Bitfinex and Tether are run by the same individuals.

* November 19, 2017: Tether is hacked, with 31 million USDT suddenly disappearing. Tether Limited reacts to this by creating a hard fork.

* December 4, 2017: Right after hiring the PR firm 5W to help improve their image, Bitfinex hires law firm Steptoe & Johnson and threatens legal action against critics.

* December 6, 2017 - CFTC issues a subpoena to Tether and Bitfinex. This news isn't made public until the end of January. 

* December 21, 2017 : Without making any formal announcement, Bitfinex appears to suddenly close all new account registrations. Those trying to register for a new account are asked for a mysterious referral code, but no referral code seems to exist.

* After a month of being closed to new registrations, Bitfinex announces it is reopening its doors, but now requires new customers to deposit $10,000 before they can begin trading.

* Friedman LLP completely cut ties with Tether on January 27, 2017.

#Most common misconception: Tether is only a small part of the total market cap

One of the most common misconception people have about cryptocurrencies is that the ""market cap"" amount they see on CoinMarketCap.com is actually the amount of money that is invested in each coin. 

I often hear people online dismiss any issue with tether by simply claiming its not big enough to cause any effect, saying ""Well Tether is only $2.2 billion on CoinMarketCap and the market is 400 billion, its only 0.5% of the market"". 


But this misunderstands what market capitalization for cryptocurrency is, and just how different the market cap for Tether is to every other token. The market cap is simply the last trade price times the circulating supply. It doesn't take into account the order book depth at all. The majority of Bitcoin (and most coins) are held by those who either mined or purchased for a very low price early on and simply held on as very small portions of the total supply was rapidly bid up to their current price.

An increase in market cap of X does NOT represent an inflow of X dollars invested, not even close. A 400 billion dollar market cap for crypto does NOT mean that there is 400 billion dollars underwriting the assets. Meanwhile a 2 billion dollar Tether market cap means there should be exactly $2 billion backing up the asset.

Nobody can tell for sure exactly how much money has been invested in cryptocurrency market, but [analysts from JPMorgan](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-02/jpmorgan-has-some-bad-news-bitcoin-bears) found that there was only net inflow of $6 billion fiat that resulted in $300 billion market cap at the time. This gives us a roughly 50:1 ratio of market cap to fiat inflow.  Prominent crypto evangelist Julian Hosp [gives the following estimate](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/heres-why-market-capitalisation-is-a-bad-way-to-measure-a-cryptocurrencys-value-2018-1): ""For a cryptocurrency to have a market cap of $1 billion, maybe only $50 million actually moved into the cryptocurrency.""

For Tether however the market cap is simply the outstanding supply, 2.2 billion USDT is actually equal to 2.2 billion USD. In order to get $50 USDT you have to deposit $50 real U.S. dollars and then 50 completely new tokens will be issued, which never existed before on the market.

What is also often ignored is that Bitfinex allows margin trading, at a 3.3x leverage. Bitfinexed did an excellent analysis on how tether is entering Bitfinex to fund margin positions

There are $2.2 billion in Tether outstanding and the current market cap of the entire market is $400 billion according to CoinMarketCap. You can actually calculate Tether as a % of total fiat invested in the market according to the JP Morgan estimate, the following table outlines for a scenario of no margin lending and 15/25% of tether being on a 3.3x leverage margin account:

Fiat Inflow/Market Cap Ratio | Tether as % of total market (no margin) | Tether as % of total market (15% on margin) | Tether as % of total market (25% on margin) 
----------|----------------|----------------|----------------
JP Morgan estimate (50:1) | 27.5 % | 36.9 % | 43.3 %

Even without any margin lending Tether is underwriting the worth of about 27.5% of the cryptocurrency market, and if we assume only 25% was leveraged out at 3.3x on margin we have a whole 43% of the market cap being driven by Tether inflow.

A much better indicator on CoinMarketCap of just how influential Tether is actually the volume, i[ts currently the 2nd biggest cryptocurrency by volume](http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/volume/24-hour) and there are even days where its volume exceeds its market cap. 

What this all means is that not only is the market cap for cryptocurrencies drastically overestimating the amount of actual fiat capital that is underwriting those assets, but a **substantial portion of the entire market cap is being derived from the value of Tether's market cap rather than real money**.

Its incredibly important that more new investors realize that Tether isn't a side issue or a minor cog in the machine, but one of the core underlying mechanisms on which the entire market worth is built. **Ensuring that whoever controls this stablecoin is honest and transparent is absolutely critical to the health of the market.**

#Two main concerns with Tether

The primary concerns with Tether can be split into two categories:

1. Tether issuance timing - Does Tether Ltd issue USDT organically or is it timed to stop downward selling pressure? 

2. Reserves - Does Tether Ltd actually have the fiat reserves at a 1:1 ratio, and why is there still no audit or third party guarantee of this?


#Does Tether print USDT to prop up Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?

In the last 3 months the amount of USDT has nearly quadrupled, with nearly a billion being printed in January alone. Some people have found the timing of the most recent batch of Tether as highly suspect because it seemed to coincide with Bitcoin's price being propped up. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/bitfinex-bitcoin-price.html

This was recently analyzed statistically: 

>Author’s opinion - it is highly unlikely that Tether is growing through any organic business process, rather that they are printing in response to market conditions.

>Tether printing moves the market appreciably; 48.8% of BTC’s price rise in the period studied occurred in the two-hour periods following the arrival of 91 different Tether grants to the Bitfinex wallet. 

>Bitfinex withdrawal/deposit statistics are unusual and would give rise to further scrutiny in a typical accounting environment.

https://www.tetherreport.com

I'm still undecided on this and I would love to see more statistical analysis done, because the price of Bitcoin is so volatile while Tether printing only happens in large batches. Simply looking at the Bitcoin price graph over the last 3 months and then the Tether printing its pretty clear there is a relationship but it doesn't seem to hold over longer periods.

Ultimately to me this timing isn't that much of an issue, as long Tether is backed by US dollars. If Bitfinex was timing the prints then it accounts to not much more than an organized pumping scheme, which isn't a fundamental problem. The much more serious concern is whether those buy order are being conducted on the faith of fictitious  dollars that don't exist, regardless of when those buy orders occur.


#Didn't Tether release an audit in September?

Some online posters have recently tried to spread the notion that Tether has actually been audited by Friedman LLP and that a report was released in September 2017. That was actually just a consulting engagement, which you can read here:

https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf

They clearly state that:

>This engagement does not contemplate tests of accounting records or the performance of other procedures performed in an audit or attest engagement. Our procedures performed are not for the purpose of providing assurance...In addition, our services do not include determination of compliance with laws and regulations in any jurisdiction. 

They state right from the beginning that this is a consultancy job (not an audit), and that its not meant to be assurance to third parties. Doing a consultancy job is just doing a task asked by your customer. In a consultancy job you take information as true from the client, and you have no mandate to verify whether your customer's claims are true or not. The way they checked is simply asking Tether to provide them the information:

>All inquiries made through the consulting process have been directed towards, and the data obtained from, the Client and personnel responsible for maintaining such information.

Tether provided a screenshots of twp bank balances. One of these is in the name of Tether Limited, and while the other is a personal account of an individual who Tether Limited claims has a trust agreement with them:

>As of September 15, 2017, the bank held $60,919,810 in **an account in the name of an in individual for the benefit of Tether Limited**. FLPP obtained an engagement letter for an interim settlement plan between that individual and Tether Limited and that **according to Tether Limited, is the relevant agreement with the trustee. FLLP did not evaluate the substance of the letter and makes no representation about its legality.**

Even worse is that later on in Note 1, they clearly claim that there is no actual evidence that this engagement letter or trust has any legal merit:

>**Note 1: FLLP makes no representations about sufficiency or enforceability of any trust agreement between the trustee and the Client**

Essentially what this is saying is that the trust agreement may not even be worth the paper it’s printed on. 

And most importantly… Note 2:

>“**FLLP did not evaluate the terms of the above bank accounts and makes no representations about the clients ability to access funds from the accounts or whether the funds are committed for purposes other than Tether token redemptions**”

Basically Tether gave them a name of an individual with $60 million in their account according to a screenshot, Tether then gave them a letter saying that there is a trust agreement between this individual and Tether Limited. They also have account with $382 million but no guarantee that this account holds to any lien or other commitments, or that it can be accessed. 

Currently Tether has 2.2 billion USDT outstanding and we have absolutely no idea whether this is actually backed by anything, and the long promised audit is still outstanding.


# What happens if its revealed that Tether doesn't have its US dollar reserves?

According to Thomas Glucksmann, head of business development at Gatecoin: ""If a tether debacle unfolds, it will likely cause quite a devastating ripple effect across many of the exchanges that see most of their volumes traded against the supposedly USD-backed cryptocurrency.""

According to Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley: ""You could see a spike in prices in tether-only bitcoin exchanges. So, on those exchanges only you will see a run up in price compared to the bitcoin exchanges that actually work with actually money. So you would see a huge price diverge as people see that only way they can turn tether into real money is to buy other cryptocurrency then move to another exchange. That is a bank run.""

I definitely see the crypto equivalent of a bank run, as people actually try to secure their gains an realize that this money doesn't actually exist within the system:

> If traders lose confidence in it and its value starts to drop, “people will run for the door,” says Carlson, the former Wall Street trader. If Tether can’t meet all its customers’ demand for dollars (and its Terms of Service suggest that in many cases it won’t even try), tether holders will try to snap up other cryptocurrencies instead, temporarily causing prices for those currencies to soar. With tether’s role as an inter-exchange facilitator compromised, investors might lose faith in cryptocurrencies more generally. “At the end of the day, people would be losing substantial sums, and in the long term this would be very bad for cryptocurrencies,” says Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell professor and co-director of its Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts.

>Another concern is that Bitfinex might simply shut down, pocketing the bitcoins it has allegedly been stockpiling. Because people who trade on Bitfinex allow the exchange to hold their money while they speculate, these traders could face substantial losses. “The exchanges are like unregulated banks and could run off with everyone’s money,” says Tony Arcieri, a former Square employee turned entrepreneur trying to build a legally regulated exchange.

https://www.wired.com/story/why-tethers-collapse-would-be-bad-for-cryptocurrencies/

The way I see it, this would be how it plays out if Tether collapses:

1. Tether-enabled exchanges will see a massive spike in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices as everyone leaves Tether. Noobs in these exchanges will think they are now millionaires until they realize they are rich in tethers but poor in dollars.

2. Exchanges that have not integrated Tether will experienced large drops in Bitcoin and alts as experienced investors flee crypto into USD. 

3. There will be a flight of Bitcoin from Tether-integrated exchanges to non-Tether exchanges with fiat off-ramps. Exchanges running small fractional reserves will be exposed, further increasing calls for greater reserves requirements.

4. The exchanges might slam the doors shut on withdrawals.

5. Many exchanges that own large balances of Tether, especially Bitfinex, will likely become insolvent. 

6. There will be lawsuits flying everywhere and with Tether Limited being incorporated on a Carribean Island whose solvency and bankruptcy laws will likely ensure they don't ever get much back. This could take years and potentially push away new investors from entering the space.

#Conclusion

We can't be 100% completely sure that Tether is a scam, but its so laiden with red flags that at this point I would call it the biggest systematic risk in the crypto space. Its bigger than any nation's potential regulatory steps because it cuts right into the issue of trust across the entire ecosystem.

Ultimately Tether is centralizing one of the very core mechanics of the cryptocurrency markets and asking you to trust one party to be the safekeeper, and I really see very little reason to trust Bitfinex given their history of lying and screwing over their own customers. I think that Tether initially started as a legit business to facilitate the ease of moving money and avoiding regulations, but somewhere along the lines greed and/or incompetence took over (something that seems common with Bitfinex's previous actions). Right now we're playing proverbial hot potato, and as long as people believe that Tether is worth a dollar everything is fine, but as some point the Emperor will have to step out from hiding and somebody will point out they have no clothes.

In the long term I really hope once Tether collapses we can move on and get the following two implemented which would greatly improve the market for all investors:

1. Actual USD fiat pairings on the major exchanges for the major currencies

2. Regulatory rules on exchange reserve requirements 

I had watched the Bitconnect people insist for the last 2 years that everything about Bitconnect made perfect sense because they were getting paid daily. The scam works until one day it suddenly doesn't. 

Tether could still come clean and avoid all of this ""FUD"" by simply getting a simple review of their banking, they don't even need a full audit. If everything was legit with Tether, it would be incredibly easy to have a segregated bank account with the funds used solely to back up Tether, then have an third party accounting firm simply review the account and a bank reconciliation statement then spend a few hours in contact with the bank to ensure no outstanding liabilities are held on that balance. This is extremely basic stuff, it would take a few hours to set up and wouldn't take a lot of man-hours for a qualified account to do, and yet they don’t do it. Why? Why hire a major PR firm and spend god knows how much money to pay professional PR representatives to attack ""FUD"" online instead?

I think I know why.

USDT,cryptocurrency,"Tether minted $3 billion in the past week, near$6 Billion in a month. This is a hugely bullish sign","Over the past week, Tether has minted $3 billion USDT. 

https://preview.redd.it/sjb6zytlw8pa1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ef4a913853d02cf0e0164d5d100fb3cf1dbfb74

This actually makes it $6 Billion Tether has minted in almost a month, definitely making it a fast mint rate for Tether.

Some might be quick to speculate if this is (more?) fraudulent activity by Tether. Whether you believe them to have been guilty of any of the accusations over the years, or not, is a different matter from what I wish to point out. Although on that point, Tether has come quite a ways into being *somewhat* more transparent and complying with regulation, properly backed issuance and being more trustworthy on the whole.

I see these mints as a hugely bullish sign. Tether would only seek to mint this huge amount of funds if there was demand for it. After all, more supply only dilutes prices and profits, even for the tiny margin that stablecoins trade off of. Meanwhile,Tether has only gained market share while other stablecoins have lost it. Therefore, stablecoins being a base that underpins almost all crypto trading pairs, any change in the market would be reflected mostly, and disproportionately so, in Tether's statistics and on-chain data. This is to say that the huge minting by Tether is a indicator or proxy for a massive surge in demand in crypto in general.

While this may not necessarily be big breaking news, it is still a huge confirmation. As we all obviously know that there is much more crypto demand, and where this demand came from. But it is a big bullish sign nevertheless.

It is harder to state if this new money ill be ""activated"" in price in non-stablecoin crypto tokens and cause those tokens' price appreciation, or buyers were simply looking to lock their money away in a dollar pegged-asset just to get away from banks, But even if  it sits only in dollar-pegged assets, some significant portion of it will eventually make it into non-stablecoins and Bitcoin as traders get more comfortable.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Stop holding fiat in Tether if you haven't already!,"Tether, often referred to as USDT are tokens minted by Tether Limited which is owned by the same people who own Bitfinex. It is designed to always have the value of 1 US dollar but cryptocurrency format. They supposedly achieve this by keeping 1 dollar in reserves for each Tether bought. Tether is not the only crypto that has its value pegged to 1 dollar, there are many, i.e., stablecoins. But Tether is by far the most popular. Nearly all crypto exchanges use USDT as a trading pair. What this means is, USDT is the main liquidity provider of the cryptocurrency market.

Currently, there is **68,5 BILLION** Tether in circulation, it is the **5th largest cryptocurrency** by market cap.

Now everything sounds great on paper, 1 dollar for every Tether and all of that. But in reality, Tether Limited is the single sketchiest company that has ever managed to get enormously big. Tether limited has 68,5 billion dollars under management and they have, wait for it, **19 employees.**

This means that for every employee Tether has, they control **3,6 billion dollars.**

If you don't understand what this means, let me put it this way:

In case of Tether crashing, the whole crypto market would be devastated and put back multiple years, all the innovation that crypto aims to bring would be stained by the fiasco that is Tether. I'm certain that we would say goodbye to crypto going mainstream and becoming the main way of finance dreams for a loooong time.

There are several huge red flags about how they manage the company and their reserves.

Let me talk these red flags:

They've refused multiple audits to their currency and reserves. Only info until now that us investors had about the situation of their reserves was a half-assed promise the co- founder made in an interview. 

In that same interview, he was asked if Bitfinex and Tether Limited had the same owners, he replied that they weren't related at all, they only worked with the same banks. Well guess what, **he lied.** The truth came out when the Paradise Papers were leaked, shining light to many corporations', elites' and celebrities' and also Tether's secrets.

Bitfinex got mixed up in a scandal involving a firm called Crypto Capital, an also shady fiat banking firm that has worked with even shadier clients, including Colombian Drug lords. This firm was unsurprisingly involved in a sex-trafficking scandal and the investigation that followed caused all their clients' holdings to be frozen indefinitely. 

Suddenly Bitfinex had nearly 80 percent of their clients money frozen, rendering any withdravals or trades impossible. Now normally a normal exchange in this situation would declare bankruptcy right? No. What Bitfinex did is that they took 400 million dollars worth of Tether's reserves to provide liquidity to their clients.

Remember when I said that no audits were done until now? 

The New York Attorney General launched an investigation on Tether Limited, and they reached a settlement. As a part of that settlement, Tether had to share their holdings completely. 

Here's the result:

Yup, they have **3.87% in cash.**

There are a lot more sketchy stuff Tether is involved in, but I will not talk about them. This article is long enough. 

If you want to dive deeper about Tether, please watch the video made by Coffezilla on Youtube.

What I want to finally say is, please don't hold fiat in Tether, hold it in **USDC** or even better, **DAI**. These are far better alternatives. People have already started campaings to move people to other stablecoins and I want to support that and raise awareness. 

Please do the responsible thing and don't hold USDT.

**TL;DR**

USDT,cryptocurrency,Coinbase is attacking Tether now while Binance is attacking every other exchange and Kraken is attacking Binance. We are literally having a war with ourselves right now.,"The amount of conflicts that especially the FTX collapse set on is not summarize-able in any way. But to just say that literally every entity in crypto is out after another entity before they get attacked themselves. I know all of this just sounds like gibberish but here is an part of that big conflict as an example:

How did this all start? Well, Binance attacked FTX on the basis of some leaks, then they won this battle and went on to attack other exchanges like CDC or Coinbase and said that they don't have any proof of reserves themselves (meanwhile even binance themselves did not have a proper one). Then Kraken stepped in and rightfully showed CZ his place by saying that his Proof of Reserves are ""pointless"" as there were no liabilities included.

This is just a very small part of this ""war"" as you may call it, in which crypto is fighting with itself and many may think that this is bad but it actually is not...

At the end of the day such conflicts will only come down to whoever was telling the truth and who not. If it escalates further there will surely be blood sheld but rightfully some. It could be that the exchanges actually lying to us like FTX did (there are surely more left) will just get the same treatment as FTX.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Tethers marketcap has hit an new all time high of over $85bn,"According to coinmarketcap, Tether's market cap just jumped $0.5bn in the last day, taking it to a new all time high of $85bn+

It is now apparently the third largest crypto by market cap with the vast majority of its volume stemming from Binance.

In just 3.5 years Tethers market cap has rocketed from just $4.64bn at the end of March 2020 to over $85bn today (+1700%).

The next closest in 4th position by m/cap is Binance's own token BNB at $34.57bn which has seen its own marketcap rocket from $6.55bn from Jan 2021 to $34.56bm today (+420%).

These figures are despite Binance facing it's toughest global regulatory clampdowns for many years. 

If we compare this against the rest of the top ten....

Bitcoin (1st) end of September 2020 it's market cap increased from $199bn to $671bn today (+237%)

Ethereum (2nd), $64bn in December 20 to $216bn today (+237%).

Tether (3rd) 4.64bn aMarch 2020 to $85bn today **(+1700%)**

BNB (4th) $6.55bn from Jan 2021 to $34.56bm today (+420%).

XRP (5th) $11.55bn in Nov 20 to $32.67bn today (+182%).

USDC (6th) $3.24bn in Dec 2020 to $24.49bn today (+655%).

This is another stable coin like tether that's supposed to be backed by dollar reserves like Tether. Again volumes going through Binance are hugely disproportionate to other exchanges.

Solana (7th) $1.6bn Feb 21 to $16.6bn today (+937%).

Cardano (8th) $5bn Dec 20 to $11.26bn today (+125%)

Dogecoin (9th) $1.13bn Jan 21 to $9.57 today (+746%)

Tron (10th) 1.82bn Nov 20 to $8.68bn today (+376%).

**Conclusion**

The +1700% increase of Tethers market cap compared the rest of the top ten is vastly significant and therefore I'd suggest questionable. Most of its volume appears to be going through Binance.

Questions over tether and it's backing are long standing. Out of the whole industry Tether and it's reserves need to face tougher scrutiny by regulators and government before it's too late. This is one stablecoin that could destabilise and corrupt the full crypto market. 

I believe all fiat based stablecoins should be clearly and verifiably backed 1:1 only by actual fiat currency cash accounts held at major regulated financial institutions and insuranced in their entirety before being allowed to be listed on crypto exchanges in order to safeguard the rest of the Crypto markets/ industry.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether was hacked by the same person who hacked Bitstamp in 2015,"Decided to have a look at what we could learn about the Tether hack from the blockchain, the coins are still moving around so I may edit this later as this develops.

It actually starts with this wallet here:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/12f4885dad525cc1

Look familiar? Go to the last page, that was the wallet used to steal 19000BTC from Bitstamp back in January 2015 (and which was still receiving coins from Bitstamp as recently as September, well done guys).

This wallet made two transactions, the first is fairly innocuous but I'll come back to it later:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/7b46c7e412b1f1e93ff0aa67232457dde3fb6e91f4c61e025a97e56290049050

This address then sends out a further 0.01BTC:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1LBQpqUTEmdPTH8adaV6xS8KQt6FGCD3xD

The following morning it sends 0.01 to the address that was several hours later used to empty the Tether wallet:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

I'm not quite sure why they would make a deposit like this to it hours before - perhaps to test that everything is working?

*Edit: I think these payments were to ensure that they had BTC available to pay the fees needed to move that Tether as soon as they got it*

At 10:53, the wallet makes several transactions transferring 23 million tethers from the tether wallet:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

Then at 11:10 they transfer another 7.9 million tethers. A further 50,000 tethers are transferred over at 11:54.

At 12:01, 5BTC (the bulk of the bitcoin in the tether wallet) is transferred over to the same address:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/e7e09cd092a5febdcae6b2ec76b06389c29298ed237dd1f210e1e54f096f1f92

These tethers are then transferred over to the address in the Tether announcement as their relevant blocks are confirmed.

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r

The 5BTC is also transferred to this address in amounts of roughly 1BTC per transaction:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

Following the BTC along, you arrive back at an address from before, which is confirmed to be part of the wallet holding the stolen Tether:

It's worth noting that this same address was just used to create an Omni token called lioncoin:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupsp.aspx?sp=2147484016

The BTC from the tether wallet ended up in these addresses:

https://blockchain.info/address/1HtmVRdFRqPScH7Ud6UFR6HUcndksjVmua

https://blockchain.info/address/155KG55pRsV1Y9jdwwynfGHGqR9cqPKToB

https://blockchain.info/address/1M8b8BNMEMFFem9UQpZydoespHzXjAnC9t

I will update this post as more develops.

*Edit 1*

This wallet from the Tether and Bitstamp hacks seems to be owned by the same person who took 12000BTC out of Huobi in late 2015, interesting...

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d

*Edit: Huobi are saying this is not a hack, so who knows why 12000 or so bitcoin was withdrawn from their exchange and combined with the coins from bitstamp [see here](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d) before being passed through several more wallets and onto BTC-e in batches of 1000 or so.*

Before he was taking thousands of BTC off exchanges and sending it to BTC-e, he also used to sell much smaller amounts on Localbitcoins.

So Localbitcoins guys, if you have a log of who was using [this address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1EvTV4ySZbwwsRfL6T723cg1iiFASJbqH3) back in 2015, you've got the hacker ;)

*Edit 2*

So I was [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7eho5y/tether_was_hacked_by_the_same_person_who_hacked/dq558sd/) whether this could be an inside job.

Well, maybe? I don't think there's enough evidence from chain analysis alone to draw a conclusion.

Some of the transactions which funded the lioncoin address came from an old Bitfinex wallet, and [some came from the bitstamp hack address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/6b1a2139799a82b8). Bear in mind that this is [part of the same wallet](https://blockchain.info/tx/eeaf8b9c6288c28c481d6e37d687b5c42b0222fb3d8a73bdca81c1a12243c579) that the stolen tethers were sent to.

Also if you look at the [tether address](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=3BbDtxBSjgfTRxaBUgR2JACWRukLKtZdiQ&page=1) you'll notice that when other blocks of tether were released they were quickly transferred to the Bitfinex wallet, with this 30 million being the exception, that said in prior months they had regularly left millions of tether in this address for days at a time, so this isn't necessarily a red flag.

It could be that the attacker had access to the main tether issuance address (3MbYQMM etc) or it may just be that they noticed the 30 million tethers sat on the wallet that they could manipulate. Presumably Tether know whether or not they intended to make [this](https://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=dbde10653dd7f459260c11e2a80ae887f7c72e5bfd22f5d908b489dd430be764) transaction. Without knowing that we can only speculate on whether the compromise went beyond the address that was emptied.

USDT,cryptocurrency,"Binance is balls-deep in Tether (over $17 Billion USDT) while under the gun of regulators. If a rush on capital occurs on the exchange, some serious dominoes are going to fall...and you will likely get boned. If you're smart, DO NOT store your coins (or cash) on Binance right now.","It's not new news that Binance is using Tether to support leveraged trading across the exchange...[https://www.binance.com/en/blog/391838076530913280/Binance-Futures-Trading-Platform-Increases-Max-Leverage-to-125x-with-BuiltIn-Risk-Controls-for-Traders](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/391838076530913280/Binance-Futures-Trading-Platform-Increases-Max-Leverage-to-125x-with-BuiltIn-Risk-Controls-for-Traders). (the overseas Binance, leverage trading is not allowed in binance.us)

And also not news that Tether is being ""backed"" only by some suspiciously unknown (most likely fractional) percentage of cash and  ""commercial paper"" from unknown entities. [https://www.coindesk.com/tether-first-reserve-composition-report-usdt](https://www.coindesk.com/tether-first-reserve-composition-report-usdt)

Binance is currently holding $17 BILLION Tether in its wallet. [https://wallet.tether.to/richlist](https://wallet.tether.to/richlist) .

The cycle seems something like this: Binance puts up some amount of collateral to Tether Treasury (likely some cash with the rest ""commercial paper""). Tether prints more Tether, loans it to Binance. Binance uses the new magic minted tether to give margin traders higher leverage to buy more Bitcoin....Bitcoin price goes up, more capital comes in, never ending cycle continues.  You should get the picture why this is bad without the word ""PONZI""

Multiple countries are once again cracking down on Binance. We've seen this happen before, but there's no certainty regulators won't come down harder this time. Any number of things could trigger a rush of withdrawals (eg. a margin-call on all leveraged accounts) from Binance

IF there is a sudden rush of withdrawals from Binance for whatever reason (and that rush coincides with a drop in Bitcoin prices), the exchange is going to have a dual monster on their hands. Say the US and EU regulators decide to team up to hit Binance/Binance.US with some mega regulations.

Coinciding with a decrease in BTC price, they're also going to be margin-calling a ton of those leverage accounts...inevitably resulting in heavily forced liquidations (to USDT). 

If that worst-case scenario happens, at some point they're also going to have to try to redeem all that tether they're holding for cash. But...as we've recently learned, Tether does not likely have any account with billions of dollars in liquid cash available, and Binance has an ""IOU"" with them anyway....so Tether says ""sorry Binance, you have this on loan, you're SOL"".

There is no telling how leveraged Binance is in unbacked Tethers.

So what does Binance do when they can't get liquidity to facilitate withdrawals?

It's not that unrealistic of a story given the current environment. If you need to use Binance, it should be a quick in and out.  Until things chill out with the regulatory environment, leaving any coins in there is asking to get burned.

**edit**

This post seems to have ruffled some feathers. To be clear I’m not saying this scenario will definitely play out. I’m saying this is a not impossible risk that exists with Binance, and there is no point absorbing the risk when alternatives to storing your coins exist. 

If you’re someone who thinks acknowledging and discussing risk is automatically “FUD”, and this sort of topic scares you, maybe investing in a high risk asset like crypto isn’t for you?",661,2021-07-18 00:22:07,586
USDT,cryptocurrency,insider info on how Tether is gonna pass a full audit (100069% legit),"Hello guys, I am Doo Kwon't. The new CEO of Tether. We are a Multi Billion dollar company. That's at least four zeros in our net worth. But not before a decimal place

I know that the cryptocurrency space has been generally weary weary of us. Despite us doing audits from people that *we* trust.

Look. It was hard for us to back the asset 1:1 with a dollar. That shit is mad worthless these days. We did so initially. And it was the plan. But you know, things happen.

But we have heard you guys out. You guys want to know WHAT our tokens are backed by. You DON'T want it backed by ""commercial paper"" and other fun things. We will do an ""actual"" audit soon. 

This is why we shall just swap all 70 billion USDT with DAI, which IS backed by US dollars. Doing some simple math,

USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether is responsible for the MAJORITY of crypto trading volume. This means you will NOT BE SAFE from Tether collapse/fraud uncovering even if you don't hold any.,"Tether is responsible for the majority of crypto trading volume.

&#x200B;

Over the past 24 hours Tether had a trading volume of U$ 79,942,874,644 dollars. Bitcoin had U$ 34,764,002,915 dollars traded, and ETH had U$ 19,402,373,410 dollars.

&#x200B;

**That means Tether trading volume corresponds to 1.5 times that of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Added together.** There are also days (like yesterday) where it's closer to 2 times.

&#x200B;

If you think you'll dodge a Tether crash by ""nOt HoLDinG UsdT"" you're so very mistaken, because a Tether collapse would mean much less market action, and that would make prices less stable (probably on the downside, since a big fraud would be uncovered).

&#x200B;

Tether also claimed they hold cryptoassets on their reserves that back USDT. This means that:

* Client gives Tether 10 USD, gets 10 USDT
* Client uses 10 USDT to buy $10 of Bitcoin
* Tether uses the USD to buy $10 of Bitcoin to *back* the USDT they gave the client.
* Essentially every USD is used to buy Bitcoin twice, meaning there's leverage and the Bitcoin float price is probably, at least, twice what it should be.

^(PS: For the bullet point analogy right above I'm considering Tether holds) *^(only Bitcoin)* ^(as their reserve asset of choice to back USDT. In the past they claimed to have a portion of USD, a portion in Crypto and a few other assets, but from what I remember on their pizza chart Cryptoassets were over half of their reserves.)

&#x200B;

In case of a collapse/fraud uncovering the market will dry up and prices will correct on the downside as people realize they were artificially inflated by a fraudulent company.",539,2021-09-11 22:04:15,459

Is it something to do with the ongoing freedom on information request for information on Tethers reserves?

Coindesk has joined a suit between NYAG and Tether to allow NYAG to release documents regarding Tethers reserves to news media outlets.

USDT,cryptocurrency,"For all you hoping for tether to die a quick and spectacular death, what do you think is going to happen?","Been seeing even more “rip the bandaid off” and more amateur sleuthing into how tether is worthless/smoke and mirrors. Some have gone so far to call tether a cancer that must die for crypto to ascend to some magical new ath. 

Personally, I acknowledge that they aren’t a model coin and do have suspicious backing/audit history, but I’m not rooting for their outright implosion. I seriously think people underestimate the ripple effects throughout crypto that would happen if USDT went bust. Something like 60-70% of all BTC volume is done through USDT and it’s a massive part of crypto volume in general. It this goes up in smoke, then exchanges can go under and volume would dry up considerably. This would lead to massive price drops and liquidity crises that would give governments free reign to completely shape crypto with whatever regulations they see fit. 

I’d prefer for USDT to slowly be replaced by USDC/DAI/etc and be less influential rather than the above scenario. Why do so many people think that USDT going bust would only cause short term pain?

Unlike Tether you don't have to trust they are solvent, you don't have to trust them to not exit scam, you don't have to trust the local government not to freeze their account.

Dai is not backed 1:1 with the USD, Dai is backed 1:1.5 with USD (in Ether). 

It basically works by someone locking up their Ether in a smart contract, and then you are able to draw Dai against your Ether. If your collateral is ever less than 150% of the Dai you've drawn then you get liquidated and your Dai is repaid by someone who bought your Ether. It is this mechanism which ensures Dai is always backed by real value.

CDPs (the smart contract to draw Dai) allow you to borrow money from yourself! The best part is, the thing you borrow is a fully backed stablecoin pegged to the USD!

It's the best thing to happen to Bitcoin since Ethereum in my opinion.

A stable, decentralized, permissionless p2p cryptocurrency is what Bitcoin's original mission was all about! It basically takes the best part of Bitcoin but removes the volatility, which is a major barrier to global adoption.

Don't take my word for it, please check out this link which has dozens of articles, explanations, critiques, refutations of critiques, and other documentation that can let you make up your own mind that this is as cool as I am saying.   

https://github.com/makerdao/awesome-makerdao/blob/master/README.md

Let me know if you have any questions I'm always happy to chat about Dai. 

Edit: I highly recommend you go over to http://cdp.makerdao.com and try out the system for yourself! All you need is a Metamask account (chrome browser extension) and some ETH. It's incredible. 

Edit 2: This is a great high level overview of Dai given from a talk by MakerDao's Andy Milenius. Highly recommend!

Edit 3: I have to give a shoutout to Austin Griffith and the burner wallet! It's an awesome browser based wallet that uses the xDai side chain to have instant transactions in Dai. Try it out on your phone browser at http://xDai.io The idea is that you accept or pay in small amounts (less than $50) and at the end of the day sweep the funds into cold storage. It's called a burner wallet because when you're done you burn the private key and it generates a new burner wallet right away. It's super cool. It's run on a 'Proof of Authority' network with several respected teams in the Ethereum space, so it's centralized, but the idea is you only use it as a hot wallet for small amounts.

Anyways, what is this thread about?

&#x200B;

So remember when Binance ( [CZ tweet](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1123048279124500480) ) was saying that it was moving its funds to another address with ***ONE LARGE transaction***? Well it turns out that did not happen! The original address has been drained with about 10 transactions to the new address. But hold on, the new address only has *42M Tether* at the time of writing this and the original one had over 780M! So where did the rest go?? The answer: Different addresses, thousands of them.

&#x200B;

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAOX7Hcdrag&t=1s) explains all of it perfectly and has all the evidence you need ( skip to 1:00 if you dont want to hear the troll song intro ). Please watch the video before calling me a FUDster or shill or whatever. You guys have no idea what is going on behind the scene and the person in the video has done some solid research. There is no point in repeating everything he says in text form.

I find it quite suspicious that this is all happening in the same period as when Ifinex is having difficult times. The parent company of Bitfinex called Ifinex owns both Tether and Bitfinex. For the people who didnt know Tether [is getting sued](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/attorney-general-james-announces-court-order-against-crypto-currency-company-under) by the New York State Attorney General for covering up a loss of $850M.

All of this leads to uncertainty and no wonder that over 30k BTC has been withdrawn from Bitfinex the past couple of days as you can see from the photo below. People are getting their funds off the exchange and are putting it in cold storage/sending it to other exchanges.

https://i.redd.it/bg93u5zh8dw21.png

' Thats just a coincidence dude what are you talking about stop fudding dude.  '

Well explain why not only BTC is getting withdrawn but Ethereum as well, and LOOK at how much is being withdrawn. Thats over 40% withdrawn in the last week on ***Ethereum***. The BTC price pump, Binance Tether transactions and the NYSAG investigation of fraud is all happening at the same time and no one is batting an eye.

It would be a real pity if this thread would get flooded with the same old 'FUD allegations'  instead of constructive criticism.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether Reports Record Net Profit of $2.9 Billion in Q4 2023,"Tether, a leading stablecoin issuer, has achieved remarkable financial milestones in its **Q4 2023** attestation report, disclosing **a record net profit of $2.9 billion**. Conducted by global auditing firm BDO, the report also underscores an unprecedented increase in **excess reserves, soaring to $5.4 billion.**

The substantial net operating profit of approximately $1 billion in the latest quarter can largely be attributed to **holdings in U.S. Treasuries,** with additional gains stemming from the appreciation of Tether’s **bitcoin and gold reserves** during the same period.

Tether has achieved a remarkable net profit of $6.2 billion for the entire year. Additionally, the company has expanded its cryptocurrency holdings by acquiring **an additional 8,888 bitcoins in Q4**, **totaling approximately 66,465 BTC, currently valued at around $2.8 billion**

The profit surge has boosted Tether’s **excess reserves** by $2.2 billion, now **totaling $5.4 billion**. Notably, these reserves are allocated for project investments, spanning initiatives in mining, AI infrastructure, and P2P communications, separate from Tether’s considered reserves.

BDO’s attestation has confirmed that Tether’s outstanding unsecured loans of $4.8 billion at year-end were fully covered by the excess reserves. Tether, in response to community concerns, has emphasized the removal of risk associated with secured loans from its token reserves, despite their overcollateralization.

As of December 31, Tether’s **consolidated reserves have exceeded $97 billion**, including $80.3 billion in U.S. Treasuries and $3.5 billion in gold. The consolidated liabilities related to digital tokens issued stood at $91.6 billion, with **90% backed by cash or cash equivalents.**

Such successful financial results **are promising for the crypto industry**. It’s worth remembering that Tether USDT processed $18.2 trillion worth of transactions in 2022, surpassing even VISA and Mastercard. Both of these companies are adapting to new crypto reality - example can be their collaboration with CEXs and creation of Bybit Card(With MasterCard) and Binance Card, [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) Visa Card, WhiteBIT Card, CoinBase Card (these with VISA)",192,2024-02-07 07:26:07,143

You can dislike them using low risk investments to make money off the cash they are holding to back their assets, but saying they are pumping BTC to print more to buy more BTC is just patently false.   What they are doing is generating value for their share holders through low risk investments, and generating funds they need to pay for operations, holding cash won't do that.

The commercial paper is generally the sticking point for a lot of people, and that's fair (see: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialpaper.asp) as it is an unsecured loan, if those companies go belly up they will need to fight in court as a creditor to recover funds.

Tether Critical Announcement
 
Yesterday, we discovered that funds were improperly removed from the Tether treasury wallet through malicious action by an external attacker. Tether integrators must take immediate action, as discussed below, to prevent further ecosystem disruption.

$30,950,010 USDT was removed from the Tether Treasury wallet on November 19, 2017 and sent to an unauthorized bitcoin address. As Tether is the issuer of the USDT managed asset, we will not redeem any of the stolen tokens, and we are in the process of attempting token recovery to prevent them from entering the broader ecosystem. The attacker is holding funds in the following address: 16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r. If you receive any USDT tokens from the above address, or from any downstream address that receives these tokens, do not accept them, as they have been flagged and will not be redeemable by Tether for USD.  

The following steps have been taken to address this matter:

The tether.to back-end wallet service has been temporarily suspended. A thorough investigation on the cause of the attack is being undertaken to prevent similar actions in the future.
We are providing new builds of Omni Core to the community. (Omni Core is the software used by Tether integrators to support Omni Layer transactions.) These builds should prevent any movement of the stolen coins from the attacker’s address. We strongly urge all Tether integrators to install this software immediately to prevent the coins from entering the ecosystem. Again, any tokens from the attacker’s address will not be redeemed. Accordingly, any and all exchanges, wallets, and other Tether integrators should install this software immediately in order to prevent loss:

https://github.com/tetherto/omnicore/releases/tag/0.2.99.s

Note that this software will cause a consensus change to currently running Omni Core clients, meaning that it is effectively a temporary hard fork to the Omni Layer. Integrators running this build will not accept any token sends from the attacker’s address, preventing the coins from moving further from the attacker’s address.
We are working with the Omni Foundation to investigate ways that will allow Tether to reclaim stranded tokens and rectify the hard fork created by the above software. Once this protocol enhancement is complete, the Omni Foundation will provide updated binaries for all integrators to install. These builds will supersede the binaries provided above by Tether.to. After the protocol upgrades to the Omni Layer are in place, Tether will reclaim the stolen tokens and return them to treasury.
Tether issuances have not been affected by this attack, and all Tether tokens remain fully backed by assets in the Tether reserve. The only tokens that will not be redeemed are the ones that were stolen from Tether treasury yesterday. Those tokens will be returned to treasury once the Omni Layer protocol enhancements are in place. 

We will provide further updates as they come available, and we appreciate the community’s patience, understanding, and support while we work to rectify the situation in the best possible manner to everyone’s benefit.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Bitfinex/Tether must prove Solvency - Refuse UDST/Bitfinex,"There is a large amount of community concern with the legitimacy of Tether and the connection to Bitfinex.  Most people have suggested launching investigations into the two, but lets be real, we are an unregulated community, so no authority is going to investigate in the near future.

The Solution:

The community as a whole has to demand that Tether and Bitfinex prove Solvency of both the exchange and the coin.  We need to refuse to transact in USDT and refuse to transact on Bitfinex.  What this means is take all of your trading to another exchange, and get rid of all of your Tether (I understand that in order to get rid of Tether someone else has to buy it, but I would recommend not being the one buying/holding it).  

If we want this company to prove legitimacy and solvency we must STOP USING THEIR PRODUCTS.  The crypto community has enough troubles between Bitconnect/Scam ICOs/the Public Media with proving the legitimacy of crypto that we don't need true fraud occurring on one of our biggest exchanges.  Yes if we prove that Tether/Bitfinex have been printing USDT without USD backing it will hurt the community in the short term, but it will ultimately prevent a bigger disaster in the future.  And if they are able to prove solvency/legitmacy it will reduce skepticism, which we all know, we don't need any more of that.  ",726,2017-11-19 19:25:53,353

USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether has just silently invested a part of their record-profits into BTC. They now hold $1.5b worth of BTC after just one quarter and are stillmaking $6B profits per year.,"Recently we have got the quarterly report by Tether, which was also made by an independent auditor, giving it more reliability as Tether itself is not exactly that well trusted. In just one quarter they had reported $1,5B in profits, making them most profitably per-employee company worldwide. That tally was also not too far off from some of the biggest banks profits, with tens of thousands of more employees.

But the profits are nothing interesting to us, but instead it is their new balance sheet…

Here we can see a new entry which is Bitcoin, at over $1.5B. That is over 52k BTC, more than the 40k the US government is intending to sell over the whole year.

We can also expect a high percentage of that being bought this year as the last quarterly report did not include any “Bitcoin“, possibly all $1.5B were acquired just this quarter. That is nearly half of all MicroStrategy buys.

It is even more funnier as Tether is buying that BTC from their profits and they are getting their profits through interest earnings from the US Treasury, which has been going up due to the FED raising interest rates. So basically the FED has made it possible and financed for Tether to buy more Bitcoin.",183,2023-05-16 20:10:03,225

USDT,cryptocurrency,The US Senate has NOT just requested information about Tether‘s backing by Dec 3rd,"A post on the hot page claims that the US Senate has requested information about Tether‘s backing by Dec 3rd. 
This is, at the very least, misleading and likely to induce FUD. 

Actual story: 

The ~~US Senate~~ a single member of the Senate, Sherrod Brown, sent ~~a letter to Tether~~ letters to all major stable coin issuers requesting ~~specific information about their backing~~ general information about each coins functionality. Mostly questions about the process of minting and redemption and its stability. 
Further, it isn’t clear if the letter to Tether has even been sent yet. 

So if there’s actually a crackdown on USDT incoming, it’s a long way down the road from here. The wheels of justice churn slowly and this is nothing but an initial request to understand how stablecoins work in comparison to banks. 

Please do your own research, this took 2min of Googling. 

This is the letter (copy pasted because I can’t put images in my posts): 


I write to request information regarding the Tether stablecoin. As documented in the recent report (Report) by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (the PWG), stablecoins present investor protection risks and raise several market integrity concerns. Consumers’ increased use of stablecoins, and their importance in effecting transactions in digital assets, underscores the need for greater understanding of the basic operation, and limitations, of Tether.
As the PWG noted, the market capitalization of stablecoins issued by the largest stablecoin issuers exceeded $127 billion as of October 2021, reflecting an almost 500 percent increase over the prior year. The complex terms and conditions applicable to digital assets and stablecoins, as well as the need for reliable and resilient underlying networks, can make it difficult for investors and consumers to fully understand the details of how those assets function and their potential risks. I have significant concerns with the non-standardized terms applicable to redemption of particular stablecoins, how those terms differ from traditional assets, and how those terms may not be consistent across digital asset trading platforms.
Even though stablecoins are typically “minted” in exchange for U.S. dollars, or other conventional currency, the purchase of stablecoins through a trading platform may not provide customers with the same rights and entitlements as a direct purchase from an issuer. In addition, customers may have different rights based on the amount of stablecoins owned or transacted. Furthermore, because the term stablecoin is used broadly, users may not appreciate the complexity and distinct features and terms of each stablecoin.
Accordingly, given the importance of the specifics related to the use of Tether to investors and consumers, please respond to the questions below in clear, straightforward terms. I understand that any response would not affect or change the binding terms or conditions applicable to any particular customer or circumstance, but your ability to provide information that can clarify the basic operational features of Tether is critical to improve the understanding of digital assets.

**1. Please describe the basic purchase, exchange, or minting process[es] by which customers can acquire Tether for U.S. dollars. In your answer, explain any relevant limitations or qualifications to engaging in and completing that process.**

**2. Please detail the process to redeem Tether and receive U.S. dollars. Here, also, identify any requirements or limits, including any minimum redemption size, waiting period, or qualifications.**

**3. Since Tether’s inception, how many Tether tokens have been issued, and how many have been redeemed? Over the last 12 months, what is the greatest percentage of the Tether in circulation at the beginning of a calendar week to be redeemed in the subsequent seven days?**

**4. Briefly characterize the market or operational conditions that would prevent the purchase, or redemption, of Tether for U.S. dollars, or another digital asset. For purposes of answering this question, do not list or describe legal or regulatory limitations currently described in a user agreement or terms of service. For each condition identified, please provide at least one example that occurred in the past 12 months and its duration.**

**5. Please identify any trading platforms that have enhanced capabilities, privileges, or special arrangements with respect to Tether, identifying those features and their basis (e.g., contractual or common control).**

**6. Please summarize any internal reviews or studies your company has conducted about how specific levels of redemptions would affect Tether, including its convertibility into U.S. dollars, or would affect the financial position of your company.** 

Please respond to the above by December 3. I appreciate your attention to this matter, and thank you for your timely cooperation.

Sincerely,
Sherrod Brown Chairman

USDT,cryptocurrency,"PSA: Stuart Hoagner (Tether's lawyer) just basically confirmed that Tether is in fact holding Chinese Commercial Paper. Though denying it's Evergrande debt, with default looming and its systemic effects on the China money market, this this is a Lehman Brother's-level ""Gray Rhino"" event in crypto","In the last 24 hours, $56 Billion in USDT volume was traded. That is more than Bitcoin, ETH, and the next 3 largest coins combined. It is the glue holding the world of crypto exchanges together.

I'm sure most of you have seen the movie ""The Big Short"". For the simplified cliff notes refresher - Leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, huge batches of dog-shit mortgages at high risk of default were being bundled up into various securities and bonds, which were then bought and sold by financial institutions around the world. When the defaults started rolling in....bla bla bla....global financial system collapses. Any financial institution holding the dog shit went down (either ending in bankruptcy or government bailout). Cool, remember that.

So Tether FUD has been a meme since Tether was a thing...for good reason too. Since inception, the stablecoin has been caught up in a seemingly endless stream of shadiness and legal issues. A bunch of the OG Tether execs/funders charged with bank fraud, ties to other fraudulent crypto criminal activities, shady ties to Bitfinex, The NYAG suing Tether/Bitfinex and holding them liable for lying about reserves and hiding, the current DOJ investigation...etc etc

Around 2019, Tether low key changed the claim on its website from ""We are backed 1-to-1 with cash"", to ""we are backed by cash and cash equivalents"". Of course this was swept under the table quickly in wild wild west cryptoverse.

Since January 2020, Tether's market cap (and distributions) has exploded from just $4+ Billion to now over $62+ Billion. Supposedly all safely backed by some form of financial reserve.

After the NYAG situation, earlier this year Tether was forced to finally publicly disclose their reserve composition. Although they didn't reveal much, the Microsoft Word-quality pie chart they posted did confirm that in fact just a fraction of their holdings is actual cash...the vast majority being held in ""Commercial Paper.""

What's commercial paper? It's short-term (unsecured) debt issued by companies. They're typically used to raise money for short term funding needs like buying inventory, payroll, or pre-paying construction vendors….kind of like an ""IOU"" of the corporate world. It usually gets a rating, and is usually pretty safe...so long as the companies issuing it remain solvent.

As of the latest Attestation by their sketch accountant shows Tether holds just $6.2 Billion in cash, $30.8 Billion in commercial paper, the rest T-Bills and RRPs. [https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tether\_assuranceconsolidated\_reserves\_report\_2021-06-30.pdf](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tether_assuranceconsolidated_reserves_report_2021-06-30.pdf)  

With it now in the open that these coins are actually operating more like unregulated money market funds, over the last several months alone the SEC, CFTC, DOJ, congressional financial committees, and the US Treasury department all set their sights on cracking down on stablecoins.

Furthermore, since Commercial Paper is traded at a discount to Face Value, Tether can buy up dog shit junk bonds for pennys on the dollar, but report it as the full maturity amounts on their balance sheet. Great for their balance sheet…horrible if there’s a run on Tether redemptions. 

A lot of moonbois and Crypto maxis tried to shrug all of this off, saying ""STFU FUDbois, who cares? They have a fractional reserve, regular banks do the same shit.""

This is true, except traditional banks are not gambling most of it in dog shit debt (at least hopefully not to the degree they pre-2008). Money market funds are pretty transparent with what they're invested in. And overall like them or not traditional banks are FDIC insured, meaning your funds are actually ""safu"" in the event of a run. 

Problem with Tether is that to this day, they still refuse to disclose the makeup of their commercial paper. Furthermore, at Tether's size they would be one of the biggest investors in the entire commercial paper market. However major players in the US investment markets claim they've never even heard of them. https://www.ft.com/content/342966af-98dc-4b48-b997-38c00804270a

So this has all lead to speculation that maybe their paper is in fact Chinese paper. Why does this matter? 

Over the last 2 years, Chinese property developers have been issuing debt like crazy. So much so that the Chinese government has recently begun to significantly crack down on it, fearing a thread to their entire financial system. The biggest culprit is a company called Evergrande, who has run up a tab of over $300 Billion in debt, and is at risk of default any day. Trading of their bonds were halted last week. https://gulfnews.com/business/property/chinas-evergrandes-moment-of-truth-arrives-as-bond-payment-deadlines-loom-1.82361403

As Tether's huge influx of insurances coincided with the Chinese property development debt surge, many began to speculate that Tether's holdings could in fact be Evergrande debt. 

Pressure on Tether regarding their reserves continued to mount until finally several weeks ago they released an attestation containing the supposed ratings of their paper holdings. They basically said ""Don't worry, all of our paper is rated A2 and above.""

Exoneration? Not really. Remember that scene in the Big Short when Steve Carell's character was going to the bond rating agencies only to find out that it was all a big pay-to-play scheme. The agencies gave pretty much everybody a high rating regardless of actual risk. Well...its the same thing in China. https://thediplomat.com/2019/06/understanding-chinas-bond-ratings/ It's all pay to play, everyone is given a high ratings, and the ratings don't really mean shit.

Case in point, Evergrande's rating was AA up until just a few days ago. https://www.barrons.com/articles/evergrande-suspends-trading-of-onshore-corporate-bonds-after-downgrade-51631786843

Basically, Chinese commercial paper is the equivalent of mortgage backed securities circa 2007. 

As pressure continued to build, and with regulators circling them like hawks, last week Tether finally made a public statement claiming they do not hold any Evergrande debt. They said “Tether does not hold any commercial paper or other debt or securities issued by Evergrande and has never done so,” But, they never said it wasn't Chinese paper at all.

Then just yesterday, Stuart Hoagner, Tether's lawyer put out a tweet saying.  "" If the concern is Evergrande, see our earlier statement. If the concern is Chinese CP, as such, we have published the ratings on our portfolio...""

This is essentially lawyer speak for ""We do hold Chinese paper, but don't worry because it has super good ratings"". 

So Tether is pretty much confirmed at least some or all of its paper reserves is Chinese. And if that's true, a good portion of it is probably dog shit debt right now. It does not matter if the debt is Evergrande, if the worst case scenario happens, and Evergrande defaults, the effects will be systemic throughout Chinese capital markets. The entire Chinese market will seize up. 

This event would cause the value of Tether's reserve holdings to plummet with it. If that happens, either the coin becomes unbacked, or they're forced to suck liquidity out of the market (burning coins). This is catastrophic for USDT and for crypto in general.

If Tether goes down, USDC or any other stablecoin will not have nearly enough liquidity to bail it out.  This is the Lehman-brothers gray rhino event of the crypto world.

 This is not FUD, this is a real situation you should pay attention to.
 
**TL;DR** Tether's lawyer basically confirmed they're holding a Chinese commercial paper time bomb. If Evergrande goes down, so will Tether's holdings.",384,2021-09-19 17:17:02,258

USDT,cryptocurrency,Danielle Sestagalli (Wonderland) is connected to the Tether scam! All these projects could be big front for mafia/narco money laundering operations. Related persons have been arrested in the past,"Earlier today the shocking story broke that 0xSifu heading the treasury for Wonderland Time is the same co-founder Micheal Patryn, of the infamous QuadrigaX exchange that stole $150m worth users funds. His original name wasnt even Micheal, he is a convicted identity fraud. 

Since then, many more stories have emerged detailing the shady connections of these people and their past. 

[The story is turning out to be something a fiction writer could be proud of. ](https://preview.redd.it/dickgaq6a9e81.jpg?width=669&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6016cacc331f5faa9247fe64bed558bb8eee412)

Im trying to sum up what I can find here, but damn there is a ton of stories coming out every moment. A journalist **Nicola Borzi** has published most of these details, he is an investigative journalist with 30 years of experience.  

It seems another person 0xMerlin involved with these Dani projects is none other than Giancarlo Devasini, the notorious CFO behind Tether and Bitfinex.

[Giancarlo had his skype ID merlin in his signature, this is part of NYAG's investigation into Tether. ](https://preview.redd.it/az9wb6zw59e81.jpg?width=1694&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e58065b0bc933b217cdd8618424e53d50c8e54d7)

Now coming to Danielle's projects, one after the other have lost money for investors, crashed or gotten hacked. Popsicle Finance is another one of Dani's projects that got hacked, and users lost funds. Bitfinex was hacked as well, where users lost funds and it was discovered by NYAG that Tether and Bitfinex borrowed among one another to make up the loss of funds. Just recently, Wonderland imploded and people are still trying to put together what happened, but there are massive trails of insiders pumping and dumping various tokens openly on the blockchain. 

Wonder why all these projects related to this group keep getting hacked? 

Before his present shenanigans in DeFi, Danielle Sestagalli launched regular crypto company that tried to go the fundraising route. He launched a company known as Zulu Republic. 

Dani spoke about this company Zulu, a video can be found on Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYUtAWKLFfQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYUtAWKLFfQ)

He describes Zulu as an ""identity based blockchain"". Meanwhile, just today it came to light that his Wonderland treasurer OxSifu is none other than Micheal Patryn, who previously served time for identity fraud. **Is it a co-incidence that Daniele ran a ""identity blockchain"" company, but suddenly became friends with a former identity fraud convict and made him treasurer of his Defi protocol?** 

Lets look more into this company Zulu.. details of this company could be found here on the Swiss companies register: [https://www.wirtschaftsregister.ch/shab.cfm?firma=ZULU\_MOBILITY\_TECHNOLOGIES\_GmbH,\_Chiasso&datum=01.11.2016&key=2497526](https://www.wirtschaftsregister.ch/shab.cfm?firma=ZULU_MOBILITY_TECHNOLOGIES_GmbH,_Chiasso&datum=01.11.2016&key=2497526)

Currently, Tether sits at a market cap of *$68 billion* at spot #3 and USDC coin sits at *$55 billion* at spot #4.  So USDC coin is within roughly **$13 billion** away from unseating it!

With all the uncertainty and misery right now, the last thing we would need is a total Tether collapse, so it’s terrific to see USDC more widely utilized. Hopefully we can have a smooth fade away from Tether, rather than a “rip the bandaid” period that could be much more destructive to the crypto environment.

Just some good news for you in a sea of red 😅

USDT,cryptocurrency,"Does Tether printing cause the price of Bitcoin to surge, or does Tether printing respond to the price surge and demand? Simply looking at the chart can answer that question.","There's been a theory that the only reason Bitcoin price goes up is because of Tether printing.

This theory has been debunked by actual statistical research at the University of California, Berkley.

[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=3508006](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3508006)

[https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/stable-coins-dont-inflate-crypto-markets](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/stable-coins-dont-inflate-crypto-markets)

But you don't need to do that much statistical research to see this for yourself. All you have to do is look at the chat.

When Tether prints, their market cap spikes up. Then all you have to is compare it to the price of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin price almost always foreruns Tether minting. The only exception is when Tether plays catch up, and may occasionally looks like it foreruns the price.

# The action this past month:

Here's  a look at what happened in the past month, as an example. Charts are showing the same timeline.

&#x200B;

**Part 1: the start of the rally:**

On the 7th, the bulls woke up, and started climbing the stairs:

&#x200B;

3 days later, Tether started to print in response:

&#x200B;

**Part 2, the last push before flat-lining again:**

Bitcoin continued to climb, and Tether continued to print, with about 2 days delay.

[Last price push starting on the 14th before flattening.](https://preview.redd.it/207ivfwejqmc1.jpg?width=958&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0045603becb697a0523f20534c75073ef629080b)

Last big push of Tether printing on the 16th.

&#x200B;

**Part 3, Bulls waking up again on the 26th, and Tether pushing big minting in a couple of phases:**

Bitcoin starts a big rally on the morning of the 26th, after flat action.

More than 6 hours later, Tether starts to mint in bigger chunks.

**Sometimes Tether prints, and Bitcoin dips behind it, as we've seen yesterday:**

If Tether is supposed to cause Bitcoin price rise, why is Tether minting sometimes followed by dips in price:

USDT,cryptocurrency,Why doesn’t everyone distance themselves from Tether? With no transparency or audit how can we trust them?,"
There is no transparency and they could crash the market. They can’t be trusted basically and there are other stable coins so why stick with Tether? And if no decent alternative exists why hasn’t one been made?

 They still haven’t been audited as far as I know which should be a massive red flag cos we just have to take their words for it that the money is all there on the exchange. 

 They also have people working for them with nefarious backgrounds, so why are they being trusted? They could be printing money for all we know and if they crash the market and everyone was to lose their crypto it would be a disaster. It could easily be avoided too but the longer this goes on the more I worry about it. 

 Surely everyone with holdings on Tether must know this because it would be stupid not to know the details of the company where you’re storing your crypto.",259,2021-07-02 07:12:18,257
USDT,cryptocurrency,There is a hidden risk for crypto if the US defaults: 65% of Tethers reserves are in US treasury bills.,"There is a hidden risk for crypto if the US defaults: 65% of their reserves are in US treasury bills.

[link to their report](https://assets.ctfassets.net/vyse88cgwfbl/24G4DuQ0HE7h7EQE6vGy4J/8a8a170edf687ea07b3f86048af8b87b/ESO.03.01_Std_ISAE_3000R_Opinion_31-03-2023_BDO_Tether_CRR.pdf)

Of course, the US won't default and they will pay their bills, but still an interesting risk for crypto. 

Also, Tether made a deal with the US years ago that if they would put invest most of the reserves in treasury bills, the US would not let them be because they lend all this money to the US.

They have >50 billion in treasury bills which is like 0,5% of the total US treasury and more than countries like Italy or Spain are holding. https://ticdata.treasury.gov/Publish/mfh.txt

USDT,cryptocurrency,Could Tether become a real threat to the crypto space?,"I just read an article about tether and why it could become a real danger to the whole crypto space.
Is this real? What are your opinions?

Edit:
I tried to post this but apparently a post has to have a minimum count of letters to be interesting or helpful so please forgive me for filling this post up with additional useless words so I can comply with the rules.

I will just add some parts of the article for you as a teaser:

""Tether’s claims of being backed 1:1 are provably false:
Adding to the concern for the legitimacy of Tether, is that they have also previously claimed all the way up until 2018 that their reserves were subject to frequent professional audits. This is patently false. There had not been a single independent audit conducted on Tether’s reserves up until 2020, which was conducted by a less than legitimate agency housed in the Cayman Islands.""


""Now , because Tether is completely controlled by the same guys that run a massive crypto exchange it essentially means that this crew of questionable characters (which we’ll read more about in a second) can create new Tethers (which are always worth a dollar) out of thin air and funnel them directly onto their exchange, without any scrutiny or regulation from a third party.

They can then use said Tethers (worth US$1 each despite being oftentimes unbacked) to buy real cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. After purchasing actual cryptocurrency  —   they can use new holdings of real crypto to mint even more new Tethers. This creates an enormous amount of real cash out of absolutely nowhere.

In plain English ,  by controlling the supply of Tether, this gang of anti-Robin Hoods basically gained access to their own personal money printer. They can indefinitely print money and then use that fake money to buy real cryptocurrency. They then sell this cryptocurrency and use that money to back more of their Tethers…

Beginning to see how this could death spiral?

This may sound a lot like a conspiracy theory but there’s very good reason to believe that all of this is entirely true. Here’s why...""
