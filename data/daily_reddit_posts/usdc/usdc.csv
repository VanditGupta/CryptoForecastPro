Coinbase, who has a big stake in Circle (issuer) and has been promoting it for a long time with zero fees, just tweeted this:

This means no one can sell their coin over the weekend at least. They have the nerve to act like banks being closed on the weekends is a new thing. Obviously Coinbase is afraid of the massive selloff that has already started as result of Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Bank going down. Circle held a massive cash reserve in both and failed to withdraw at least a portion of it from SVB:

At the time of writing this, both DAI and USD Coin have depegged. If you have liquidity pools with it, expect people to drain your other token and leave you with 100% USDC in your pool. The depegging will get worse since all the liquidity is being drained. Though it is not the first time its depegged, in the middle of all the banks going down, it seems more serious than before.

USDC,cryptocurrency,US crypto hodlers: You have about 2 weeks before the 1099-DA goes into effect.,"Just a friendly reminder:

Starting January 1st, 2025 (in 2 weeks), all US exchanges (e.g. Kraken, Coinbase) will start reporting your crypto transactions directly to the IRS via the [1099-DA](https://gordonlaw.com/learn/form-1099-da/).

For pretty much the entire existence of crypto so far, US users have had to self report crypto gains on their taxes (many didn't, or simply underreport). But if you have any sale transactions next year (2025) within the exchange of your choosing, they will automatically be reported to the IRS.

Especially noteworthy: If you have coins that you've held for a long time (e.g. from this year or before) and you sell them next year, the IRS will see that you have **$0 cost basis**. And you will have to show them when you acquired your coins (if it's been too long and you somehow can't find these transactions, then too bad, the IRS will just auto-calculate your cost basis as $0).

For example, if you held DOGE from 2020 and your cost basis is $0.002 (and DOGE is now $0.40), you'll have to provide the 2020 transaction where you bought DOGE for $0.002 and pay all the capital gains on the difference. Plus they'll likely audit your other trades from back then and bill you for any other unreported gains.

**TL;DR**: you have about 2 weeks to tidy up your books, lock in your gains, and make sure you have crypto and USD exactly where you want them to be when January 1st rolls around.",1521,2024-12-17 02:58:28,604

USDC,cryptocurrency,"I Took Out $94,000 in Personal Loans to Buy Crypto: 19 Month Update","Not financial advice. 

Greetings All,  

This is my 19 month update since I first took out an unsecured personal loan to buy Bitcoin. You can find my previous updates in my post history. The first is from June 2022. 

A lot has happened since my last update, so I‚Äôll get right to it‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

First off, I managed to completely pay off my 2nd loan of $20,000! 

Work has been better than usual and I had a big job in December that netted me a $12,000 windfall of which the entirety was put towards my loan balance.

Next I decided to buy even more Bitcoin by taking advantage of some really awesome Credit Card Balance Transfer offers that appeared in August/September‚Ä¶

Two of my credit cards were offering 0% APR for the first 18 and 21 months with a one time 3% and 5% transfer fee respectively. I also opened a new card that was offering a similar deal and was approved for a $12,000 limit. That combined with my previous two credit card brought my total to $40,000 in balance transfer potential. 

Balance transfer offers are great because they allow you to simply write a check to yourself and cash it in your bank account like any other check. Also, I‚Äôm only responsible to pay 1% each month, so servicing it is really easy. 

I ended up using $35,000 in balance transfer loans and buying 1.35 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$26,500. This brings my total amount of Bitcoin purchased with loans to 4 Bitcoin!!!!

**With the balance transfer monthly payments, plus the previous loans, my total monthly cost to service all these loans is \~$800.** 

I can easily afford this. In fact, I‚Äôm putting almost double that towards these loans each month to pay them down aggressively so I don‚Äôt end up paying a lot of interest when it‚Äôs all said and done. I plan to have everything paid off in less than two years. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**As of today, of the combined loans / balance transfers I have a total remaining balance of \~$56,000.**

It works out like this:

$21,000 remaining balance from unsecured personal loan.

$35,000 from new balance transfer loans. 

This brings the total amount of loans that I‚Äôve taken out so far to $94,000. I‚Äôve paid a total of \~$4,500 in interest to date, which brings the total cost basis of these loans to \~$98,500 as of January 24th, 2024.

**I have acquired a total of 4 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$24,625 per coin: $98,500 / 4 = $24,625.** 

**As of today, January 25th, 2024, the current price of Bitcoin is \~$40,000.**

**This brings the total value of the Bitcoin I acquired from loans to $160,000.**

**This represents an unrealized USD profit of \~$61,500.** 

The math is simple: $160,000 - $98,500 = $61,500

Lastly, I‚Äôm officially done taking out loans and balance transfers. I have a nice round number of Bitcoin from loans, plus my personal stack which I‚Äôve been slowly adding to from earned income. Now it‚Äôs time to focus on paying everything down over the next 2 years with earned income. I have no desire to sell my Bitcoin regardless of how high its price goes. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

USDC,cryptocurrency,Will a fed issued USD stable coin make all other USD stable coins obsolete?,"Basically what the title says. If the federal reserve issues an official stable USD crypto, will all other USD stable coins become unneeded and die  sooner or later? On one hand you can say: creating a stable coin backed 1:1 by USD will be very easy then, because you can just use the fed USD coin to back it up. But on the other hand: Why would anyone use a different stable USD coin if there is an ""official"" USD crypto?

Tl;Dr: How will central bank stable coins affect other stable coins? What are your thoughts?

EDIT: Guys I posted this before work and now I'm back and there are like 200 comments, so I can not answer to every one individually. But I already read most of them and here are some general thoughts:
- USD is not a stable coin in itself. A stable coin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a fiat currency. USD is a fiat currency. Electronic banking etc. is NOT the same as a cryptocurrency.
- I get that it's hard to have trust in the fed. But that trust is required if you use USD (or any stable coin pegged to USD) anyways, right?
- I guess much depends on how such a currency would look. If the fed created an actual crypto and not just any virtual currency, meaning a open protocol without central authority, trust in the fed would not really be needed to use that coin. Just like you don't need to trust Satoshi (or even know their identity) to use and trust bitcoin, right?

Anyways thanks for all the input, keep it coming.",169,2022-05-16 09:42:35,262

Did they explode with Bitcoin's huge rise? Let's find out:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

As usual, let's start with the worst performer of the month.

&#x200B;

**#10: XRP**

[What a fall from grace.](https://preview.redd.it/uk5i2ffiqh961.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=b39286cfbeeaea09c219560cc16ea66715134ad9)

As I'm sure many of you have been watching, the implosion of XRP has been nothing short of spectacular. What was worth almost triple the last month's price is now down *below the original investment.* And this is WITH Bitcoin almost doubling in price! It's been a sad fall for the former #3 coin on the ladder, being replaced with everyone's good friend Tether. Womp womp. We'll have to see if the coming months have any better news for XRP fans.

&#x200B;

**#9 - XMR**

&#x200B;

[A steady, but ultimately boring grind.](https://preview.redd.it/0dpvcox5rh961.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=20c5bfb6ac9235663608f576870342f0d185eb5e)

Keeping with the pace of last month, Monero continues to underperform the market and only rise slightly. Despite Bitcoin launching into the stratosphere, Monero has been hit with some delistings and uncertainty towards its future on several exchanges. It began to rise with the pack but was slapped down with the bad news. The total XMR value only rose $2 in a month, not the most stellar performance.

&#x200B;

**#8 - SOL**

&#x200B;

[Hills and Valleys.](https://preview.redd.it/w6vyugwwrh961.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=368293571b6a3202e4be5d4fc2e9fd8771f3ffa0)

SOL actually had me worried for a while, with a shattering drop all the way down to $1.17, which marked a very long time low for the coin. However, it has since rallied and almost doubled its price since then, coming in with modest profits instead of large losses. Definitely an interesting price watch for the month.

&#x200B;

**#7 - IOTA**

&#x200B;

[The price appears to be a little... tangled.](https://preview.redd.it/4117j1bfsh961.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=343eaa9da3055e3d3ea59c842e58c80fe7a2500c)

&#x200B;

Another barely-mover for the month, IOTA got us a whopping $5. It seems the price action is somewhat erratic and not necessarily tied to Bitcoin whatsoever, falling on days where Bitcoin does well, and doing well when Bitcoin has off days. Still, it stayed in the same range for most of the month, not really doing anything special or anything dire either. If this was a blue chip stock, you'd probably still love its monthly returns.

&#x200B;

**#6 - NANO**

&#x200B;

[Doing a bit of mountain climbing.](https://preview.redd.it/hmrc5qn2th961.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=c71ad29f1cbf14b7187bc1347141e24b75975965)

Nano came out of nowhere with a mediocre monthly performance, sitting around the dollar range, when suddenly a giant spike of volume propelled the coin as high as +70% of its monthly levels. Since then, it has been largely falling back to earth, but still retains quite a bit of its gains, pushing it firmly over the 100% profit margin. Will Nano continue to show strength as both Bitcoin and Ethereum congest and have wild fee increases, or was this one of many fakeouts?

&#x200B;

**#5 - ADA**

&#x200B;

[A coin on a mission.](https://preview.redd.it/lkmgi0epth961.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5440df0139733e69ed12d28dffd1e0b343c0187)

ADA had a largely mediocre performance most of December, but picked it up as Bitcoin went meteoric, following it to new heights. Excitement of the project getting somewhat close to completion and new buyers entering the market looking at the top 10 had ADA popping off during the last couple of weeks. Can it keep this momentum going into the new year?

&#x200B;

**#4 - VET**

&#x200B;

[A slight fall into a meteoric rise.](https://preview.redd.it/5d2kbyubuh961.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=eacf45d195c5a3fc37f665f9547a22fc22ae2cf8)

VET started off the month strong but lulled a bit as BTC went wild over the Christmas holidays. However, like ADA, it has since shot up incredibly fast and has continued to hold a lot of its gains. Both ADA and VET are inching closer to their 2017-2018 all time highs, nowhere close to the top but unlike a lot of Coins from that era are showing remarkable strength going into the new year.

&#x200B;

**#3 - ETH**

&#x200B;

[Money printer go BRRRR.](https://preview.redd.it/daflae14vh961.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e1e3e936817f23469245532ed1e8d0b271117e1)

ETH's chart is basically what you want to see in any Coin this month, it's basically a straight trend upwards. ETH's momentum this month has been largely unstoppable with ETH2 news coming out and the large DEFI following - It looks positioned to do very well and uphold the big responsibility of being the #2 coin. With news of stablecoins being vetted by the US Government, it may perform even better in the future.

&#x200B;

**#2 - LTO**

&#x200B;

[Disgusting growth.](https://preview.redd.it/nyiecvbnvh961.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=17457a0c5fa91f71e641a510ce8aede7927d180d)

What chart could look better than ETH's, almost doubling in a month, you ask? Well, the answer is simple - LTO. It seems to have caught fire going into the new year, nearly doubling the investment from last month, where it was already the #3 performer. LTO doesn't seem to show any sign of slowing down either, entering the top 200 strong and continuing to grow even as I type this post out. 

&#x200B;

**#1 - DOGE**

&#x200B;

[But of course. Wait, what? What's happening?](https://preview.redd.it/06k1d4smwh961.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd64c5d4766aae602e273139544024f3d01ec2ca)

In a twist basically no one could've expected, DOGE is far and away the biggest and best winner of the month. It's not even remotely close. At one point, DOGE has **QUADRUPLED** the initial investment, and only recently started to peter back down as dumbfounded holders realized their riches. It made XRP's rise last month look like a blip on the radar. Funny, because last month DOGE was a perennial underperformer, but it's tripled its valuation since then. Don't let your memes be dreams.

&#x200B;

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

&#x200B;

 Overall, the $500 portfolio has risen in value **36.14%** from last months  **$756.06** to be worth **$1029.25** 

If the $500 (10,000 moons) had been left in moons, it would now be worth **$111.**

 If the $500 had been left in BTC (0.0353 \* $31,400) it would be worth **$1108.42**

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

&#x200B;

Despite a great rise, Bitcoin has outperformed the Reddit portfolio this month, but with such a huge rise, that surely wasn't too unexpected. Most alts are playing catchup and it might take a while to see the value of all the coins with a bright and shiny $30k+ Bitcoin in the sky.

Shoutouts to  [u/Wulkingdead](https://www.reddit.com/u/Wulkingdead)  (ETH),  [u/CryptoNarf](https://www.reddit.com/u/CryptoNarf)  (LTO) and  [u/TheRealMotherOfOP](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheRealMotherOfOP) (DOGE) for winning this month. 

Until next month, keep your DOGE miners going!

USDC,cryptocurrency,A Coinbase Product Manager was Just Charged With Insider Trading and Arrested While Trying to Flee the Country,"From the Justice Department:

Beginning in approximately October 2020, ISHAN WAHI worked at Coinbase as a product manager assigned to a Coinbase asset listing team. In that role, ISHAN WAHI was involved in the highly confidential process of listing crypto assets on Coinbase‚Äôs exchanges and had detailed and advanced knowledge of which crypto assets Coinbase was planning to list and the timing of public announcements about those crypto asset listings.  Beginning at least in August 2021 and continuing through May 2022, ISHAN WAHI was a member of a private Coinbase messaging channel reserved for a small number of Coinbase employees with direct involvement in the Coinbase asset listing process.  The private channel was used to discuss, among other things, ‚Äúexact announcement / launch dates + timelines‚Äù that Coinbase did not wish to share with all of its employees.

***The Insider Trading Scheme:***

On at least 14 occasions beginning at least in June 2021 and continuing through April 2022, ISHAN WAHI knew in advance both that Coinbase planned to list particular crypto assets and the timing of Coinbase‚Äôs public announcements of those asset listings and misappropriated that Coinbase confidential information by tipping either his brother, NIKHIL WAHI, or ISHAN WAHI‚Äôs friend and associate, SAMEER RAMANI, so that they could place profitable trades in those crypto assets in advance of Coinbase‚Äôs public listing announcements.

After getting tips from ISHAN WAHI, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI used anonymous Ethereum blockchain wallets to acquire crypto assets shortly before Coinbase publicly announced that it was listing or considering listing these crypto assets on its exchanges.  Following Coinbase public listing announcements, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI sold the crypto assets for a profit.  Based on confidential information provided by ISHAN WAHI, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI collectively traded shortly in advance of at least 14 separate Coinbase public listing announcements concerning at least 25 different crypto assets.  As a result of the insider trading scheme, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI collectively generated realized and unrealized gains totaling at least approximately $1.5 million.

To conceal their purchases of crypto assets in advance of Coinbase listing announcements, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI used accounts at centralized exchanges held in the names of others, and transferred funds, crypto assets, and proceeds of their scheme through multiple anonymous Ethereum blockchain wallets.  NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI also regularly created and used new Ethereum blockchain wallets without any prior transaction history in order to further conceal their involvement in the scheme.

***ISHAN WAHI‚Äôs Attempt to Flee the United States:***

On April 11, 2022, Coinbase announced that it was considering potentially listing dozens of crypto assets on its exchanges. Based on Coinbase confidential information provided by ISHAN WAHI, RAMANI caused multiple anonymous Ethereum blockchain wallets to purchase large quantities of at least six of the crypto assets that were to be included in Coinbase‚Äôs April 11, 2022 listing announcement.

Shortly after RAMANI traded in advance of Coinbase‚Äôs April 11 listing announcement, on April 12, 2022, a Twitter account that is well known in the crypto community tweeted regarding an Ethereum blockchain wallet ‚Äúthat bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of tokens exclusively featured in the Coinbase Asset Listing post about 24 hours before it was published.‚Äù  The trading activity referenced in the April 12 tweet was the trading caused by RAMANI.  Coinbase thereafter publicly replied on Twitter noting that it had already begun investigating the matter and a few weeks later stated in a public blog post that any Coinbase employee who leaked confidential company information would be ‚Äúimmediately terminated and referred to relevant authorities (potentially for criminal prosecution).‚Äù

On May 11, 2022, Coinbase‚Äôs director of security operations emailed ISHAN WAHI to inform him that he should appear for an in-person meeting relating to Coinbase‚Äôs asset listing process at Coinbase‚Äôs Seattle, Washington office on Monday, May 16, 2022. ISHAN WAHI confirmed he would attend the meeting.

On the evening of Sunday, May 15, 2022, ISHAN WAHI purchased a one-way flight to India that was scheduled to depart the next day shortly before ISHAN WAHI was supposed to be interviewed by Coinbase.  Prior to boarding the flight, ISHAN WAHI falsely told Coinbase employees that he had already departed for India when he had not.  In the hours between booking the flight and his scheduled departure, ISHAN WAHI called and texted NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI about Coinbase‚Äôs investigation, and sent both of them a photograph of the messages he had received on May 11, 2022, from Coinbase‚Äôs director of security operations.  Prior to boarding the May 16, 2022 flight to India, ISHAN WAHI was stopped by law enforcement and prevented from leaving the country.

USDC,cryptocurrency,"Elizabeth Warren is yet again hitting out on crypto, claiming Russia could use it to evade sanctions. Yet all evidence points to a democratic country Ukraine using and has received $20 million in crypto donations. Why not support whats going on instead of creating a non-story to spread FUD? Shame.","Elizabeth Warren says crypto could be used to evade sanctions. 

[Cryptocurrencies risk undermining sanctions against Russia, allowing Putin and his cronies to evade economic pain.  ](https://preview.redd.it/acyupa6vrsk81.jpg?width=1184&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1402d66b989ee6048bec4f4ed100fe1a8bc28a17)

Except this is not whats happening, and on the contrary its Ukraine thats using crypto for good. Yet none of these Senators celebrate crypto for what its actually being used for, but instead create a non-story to serve their vested interests of slamming crypto.

How pathetic could all of this get? 

She just wants an opportunity to somehow link it to hit out against crypto. Using her public and visible position to spread her own agenda when the country thats most affected by whats going on is actually  using crypto for the betterment of its people in the present terrible situation. 

[Infact, just now Ukraine took up on Gavin Wood's generous offer too. ](https://preview.redd.it/wqgx98gwssk81.jpg?width=1198&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=699dcd94d491efbe6d57968d1606ba9cbd1aea67)

And was able to find a bit of humor even in circumstances such as now..

Edit: There are of course a possibility that this could happen, but as of now there is no evidence that it is happening. Nor is it likely in the future, infact Russia is more likely to use China's SWIFT replacement known as CIPS - Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or use their own SWIFT replacement SPFS (less likely as low liquidity).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPFS - Russian Central Bank has already said SPFS could be an option, and 23 countries foreign banks are already connected to it. 

USA is already the largest liquid crypto markets, if Russia starts accepting crypto for their strategically important export oil, they wont have any places to spend their crypto as the liquid USD-crypto market is already closed for them. Whats the point of earning say 10,000 crypto coins for a million barrels of oil, if they cant spend it anywhere due to lack of counterparties willing to trade with them? Russian Ruble - crypto pairs are non-existent today. Also, they cant use that crypto to buy commodities from other countries either, as these countries could come under risk of sanction themselves, and furthermore high volume crypto-commodity market is also non-existent right now. No country is going to be ready to start accepting say 10m  tonnes of Wheat for Crypto. Such a scenario is not even possible right now given the structure of crypto markets.

That is why it is important for USA to actually build dominance in crypto markets, and yet you have people like Liz spinning up a""crypto is bad"" narrative whenever they get the chance to do    

Being afraid of Russia using crypto to evade sanctions is literally being scared of the boogeyman, especially when CIPS and SPFS offer much more immediate options for them.",7696,2022-03-01 16:26:49,1279

USDC,cryptocurrency,"For the newcomers: the top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence.","I tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow ‚Äúonline payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.‚Äù

32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it‚Äôs actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it‚Äôs commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person‚Äôs identity, it‚Äôs often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",14810,2021-02-09 12:03:25,1588

This got me to thinking about the first time I heard of Bitcoin. I was a freshman in college and a computer science major. It was Fall of 2010. I was in the lab when a Sophomore csci major asked me if I wanted to help him set up the \~35 computers in the lab for mining Bitcoin.  His plan was to mine every night after classes ended until 8am when classes began again and 24 hours over the weekend.

Me, thinking it was a waste of time with Bitcoin being like $.06, said no. The guy ended up setting up the computers himself, mining \~2,000 BTC, and in 2013 when the price hit $1,000, sold half his stack to become a millionaire in college. 

Where were you the first time you heard of Bitcoin and what was the price per coin?",5403,2022-10-06 14:14:49,845
USDC,cryptocurrency,How to Create your very own Shit Coin and become a Millionaire overnight!,"So I like many of you have found my self looking less and less at the charts and trying to occupy myself with other things like work and sleep, both of those things get old pretty fast so I asked myself ""What If I made my own Shit Coin??""

The process is fairly easy and will cost you surprisingly little, the entire process cost me only 15 ALGOs and I could still withdraw most of that out of the wallet I created for this project. I decided to use Algorand for this due to it's ease of use and low fees.

# Step one: The Wallet

Create a Pera Wallet and transfer around 15 ALGO into it. (around $5.00 USD)

Pera wallet is available on Android and IOS, you can also use any other ALGO wallet you prefer.

# Step Two: Creating the Algorand Standard Asset

Head on over to [algodesk.io](https://algodesk.io) and connect said wallet.

click on the top right button labeled **create asset,** you will get the following box pop up. fill in the required information and confirm the transaction on you wallet. (this fee I believe is around 1 ALGO)

^(For this example I decided to create the shittiest shit coin I could think of so its called ButtCoinASA in honor of) r/Buttcoin

&#x200B;

# Congratulations, you are now the proud owner of your very own ALGO ASA

# Step Three: Providing Liquidity

So now you have this new asset in your wallet but its not really known to the world, what to do?

Visit Algorands best DEX called [tinyman.org](https://tinyman.org) then follow the steps below.

* connect wallet
* click on the tab labeled **pool**
* click create pair
* select Algo and (your new ASA), you'll have to search for it and click on the box labeled ^(""hide unverified assets"")
* &#x200B;

* now add as much ALGO and your ASA as you want (this will give it your initial value, if you add 1 ALGO and one ButtCoin then 1 ALGO = 1 Butt)
* Congrats, your ShitCoin now has some value
* wait about thirty minutes and then head on over to [tinychart.org](https://tinychart.org)
* &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gtfprjtvjw191.png?width=1659&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb7c84a5705bb8362f47036c486d855fe3109d08

* and look, your ShitCoin is now listed and shows a value.

# Step Four: Be A Millionaire

that's it

Your done.

You are now a Millionaire \*^(on paper)

So I created ButtCoinASA and I hold all one billion of them so if you multiply 1,000,000,000 x $0.0019 + 1.9 million dollars!!!!!

sure I cant cash it out because it only has $3.00 worth of liquidity but it does look like green on that chart to me so I'll take it.

&#x200B;

So there you have it boys and girls, you are now the owner of your very own bonafied Shit Coin.

What can you do with it? well what ever you'd like to

* share it with friends
* give it to strangers
* start some sort of reward system for your kids
* if your competent maybe even turn it into an actual project with some real uses and make some money
* the sky is the limit

# Edit: This is a shitcoin and I'm giving it away by the thousands, please do not provide liquidity I don't want to be responsible for people losing their money.",5310,2022-05-26 23:20:49,1316

USDC,cryptocurrency,Not a single top 100 Alt from 2021/2022 has hit a new ATH against BTC. ,"An Alt to BTC pair tells how a crypto asset is performing against BTC over a period of time. Perhaps the most famous alt to btc pair is ETH to BTC and although ETH is up in USD it has never hit a new ATH against BTC.

https://preview.redd.it/eyhhd1wf946e1.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bc377c08596648b802ac69b4ef20f8684f55c87

In fact if you purchased ETH during the ETH to BTC ATH on June 11th 2017 you'd be up \~11X in USD on your investment. But had you bought BTC instead you'd be up over 33x...

https://preview.redd.it/gh4hhi9y946e1.png?width=1671&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ceff32260d5b66321b634b363200a89a90a28a1

The fact is almost every single alt will be outperformed by BTC over time and although a few alts may break that trend especially in the short term. Holding alts through multiple cycles is risky at best and foolish at worst.

If we look at the top 100 Alts from 2021, not a single alt from the top 100 in 2021 has managed to break it's 2021 or 2022 ATH against BTC.

[https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20211123023737\/https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en](https://preview.redd.it/x4to82txa46e1.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2620245e886d4244b02ed05238bdf2760246efa)

Now you're probably thinking one of the following. So I'll preemptively address them.

* ""Alt season is just getting started this isn't a fair comparison""
* ""Ya But I'm up in USD on my investment""
* ""I don't want to trade because taxes are complicated""
* ""It's safer to hold and your grandchildren will thank you""
* ""Stop trying to get people to sell""
* ""I'm not a trader I make a plan and stick to it""
* ""You're a trashy BTC Maxi""

So let's break these down one by one.

**\* ""Alt Season is just getting started""**

BTC Dominance has definitely fallen but if you're gambling on future gains you have to first accept it's a gamble, and the current break down could be the farthest that it goes. If you have gains it's not a bad thing to realize gains.

**\* ""Ya but I'm up in USD on my investment""**

If that's you, you either purchased a long time ago in a bear market and held through a bull market, and a bear market - and you would most likely be up even more if you just purchased BTC. Alternatively you are a new purchaser and you got some nice gains on the breakdown of BTC dominance.

If you held your ALT from 2021 to today you are guaranteed to be down significantly compared to just holding BTC.

**\* ""I don't want to trade because taxes are complicated""**

Ya Taxes are complicated but that only matters if you're in profit. If you hold your alt to the top and back down because ""you're a long term holder"", you are simply making bad investment decisions.

**\* ""It's safer to hold and your grandchildren will thank you""**

Please STOP with this nonsense, Long term nearly every Crypto asset will not only bleed value against BTC but also bleed value in USD. Don't believe me check the top 100 crypto assets in 2017, 2021, and 2024 and count how many assets from 2017 are still in the top 100 today.

**\* ""Stop trying to get people to sell""**

I'm not trying to get people to sell, I'm trying to get people to stop with the the nonsense where they demonize selling. You can hold your alt of your choice just don't reinforce the mindless selling alts is bad philosophy.

**\* ""I'm not a trader I make a plan and stick to it""**

It's always good to stick to a plan in investments and to think rationally but if your plan is to hold your alt for the next ten years, just buy BTC instead.

**\* ""You're a trashy BTC Maxi""**

I'm not a BTC Maxi I wouldn't have 98% of my crypto investments in rCC Moons if I was a BTC maxi.

USDC,cryptocurrency,"Dear newbies, are you looking for a promising coin under $1, or even under $0.1? Don't!","**EDIT: read the post before you shill your sub-$1-coins, please, why does nobody do this today?**

I always see these posts a lot, but for some reason more in the past few days:

*""what are the best coins under $X?""*

And sure, it looks like that makes sense - Bitcoin (BTC) is super expensive already, while a coin like BitTorrent (BTT) is available for less than one cent! If you buy some now and they become as expensive as Bitcoin you will be rich! Bitcoin also used to be cheap! Right?

Lol, nah, wrong, obviously. The thing is: coin price doesn't matter. At all. Because it is strongly affected by how many coins are in circulation. There are currently about 18,700,000 BTC in circulation, there will never be more than 21,000,000. But there are 660,000,000,000 BTT at the moment and there will be 990,000,000,000 at some point. The important figure is the market cap, which is

**Market Cap =  Circulating Supply  X Coin Price**

So, for example, for BTC it would be  49,500 X 18,700,000, about 920 billion USD. So if we imagine BitTorrent becoming just as big as Bitcoin, how much would a single coin be worth? $1.38. So can't a single BTT be worth thousands of dollars, like BTC is? No, absolutely not. If 1 BTT would be worth 49,500, as 1 BTC currently is, its market cap once all the coins are in circulation would be almost 50,000,000,000,000,000. 50 quadrillion, or 50,000 trillion. The total amount of wealth in the world is about 300 trillion.

**tl;dr:** Coin price is NOT a good indicator how much a coin can still grow. Check the market cap and compare it to other coins to see how much a coin would need to grow to be as big as another coin. [The Coin Perspective](https://thecoinperspective.com) is a great website to make these comparisons. Also remember that you can buy fractions of a coin, like 0.001 BTC and don't have to buy a whole one.",8753,2021-05-15 15:08:46,1678
USDC,cryptocurrency,I'm been in crypto since 2013. Maybe 700+ alt coins and many trades. Now a Defi-Crypto Farmer. Here are some of my tips and advice for new-comers.,"As the title says I'm into crypto pretty deep.  I was in crypto briefly in 2013, but only really hit the ground running in 2017 and never looked back.  In 2017 I made all the usual mistakes, got into the wrong coins, entered some dodgy exchanges and sold the wrong coins (like selling Enjin on its first day after investing in the ICO).  In 2018 things got worse, with shitcoins driving the BTC value of my holdings down by half.

Now I'm sitting really pretty and feel like I have ""clicked"" to the point where I am generally making money in crypto and quite a few people ask me for advice on what to do, strategies etc.  Here are some of my tips, observations and ideas.

1. Don't trust anyone.  Assume everybody you are talking to is a friendly thief who wants your money.  That includes people shilling particular coins, or anyone asking for your crypto to invest, to random people that message you.  (And yes ironically this means don't trust me, but you'll see I didn't mention my altcoin holdings and I am deliberately staying quiet on what my 800% defi pool is  :) )
2. Every position you enter should be a fixed percentage of your portfolio.  I prefer 1% for a typical trade.  Risky uniswap gems might be 0.5%, very strong longer term positions say 2-5%.
3. Have your portfolio value in BTC (or ETH if you prefer that).  Your goal is to increase your BTC value.  Each trade should be from BTC, and then exit back out of BTC.  Log all transactions in blockfolio etc under the BTC pair, so you can see how much BTC value you are gaining.  Don't worry as much about USD gains, as in a bull market its easy to make USD value gains.  BTC is the end-game here so you want to accumulate BTC, especially if BTC dominance is falling.
4. Have a portion of your portfolio allocated to farming or staking.  If you have a coin sitting somewhere for ages, ask if there is some way for you to make money from it.  For example, I have a large stack of BTC and ETH, so rather than have it sitting doing nothing, I wrapped the BTC and entered a Sushi Farm.  Months later the rewards from that farm are worth something like 25% of the amount I initially invested.  Every so often, harvest the rewards and either re-farm (compounding) or shift to your long term hold.  Remember compound interest.  There are opportunities for very high returns (without ponzi aspects but be careful) - find those, constantly take and re-invest the income and the gains are quite extreme.
5. Have a dedicated stack of BTC or ETH that is your ""HODL"" portfolio that you never touch.  Preferably in seperate legal entity (like a trust) than what you trade with.  This will help for taxes.  Every so often, move some profits into that long term stack.   I don't do anything with that stack at all, it is just my safe holdings.
6. Spend as much time learning about tax as you do trading.  Tax is something you kind of need to understand upfront - you can get way more rekt from bad tax approaches than you make gains with good trading.  And keep your records safe - download all trade histories at the end of every quarter.
7. Use telegram (or discord).  Find really helpful smart and useful people and stick to them.  Find helpful trading groups.  Eventually they will be a vital source of information or just ways to bounce ideas off.  Check out my previous post for a full guide on ""must have"" telegram groups.
8. Read the crypto news as much as you can.  Its amazing how often something pops up (e.g. grayscale announcing new trusts with other coins) and there is still a decent amount of time to buy.  And always have some BTC on an exchange ready to buy on such an opportunity.  Again, telegram is great for this as you can quickly see tweets or news-links being shared.
9. Have a preset % of gain or losses whereby you will sell if it reaches that.  For example, for most coins, if a coin ever goes up more than 30% vs BTC in a day I always sell.  95% of the time that works out as better than holding.  In the rare event I double my position I always sell the principal immediately (I did this twice this year - with Ethernity and Blind Boxes).
10. Always have an idea as to what the current ""climate"" is in terms of what is moving and in favour.  Crypto markets often move with certain sectors at a time.  For example, if you look at the Coin Gecko categories list, you can immediately spot what is ""hot"" right now.  Last month it was NFTs, so I was heavy in that space, but now that sector is cooling.  The binance smart chain and exchange coins are doing very well right now - if that is the case what else might move?  Well other low gas blockchains could be an idea - especially if they have defi - so Avax, Raydium etc are all moving too.  Soon it might well be BTC's time to gain as the expense of alts.  You should be rotating in and out of positions to try and go with the ebb and flow of the market.
11. For newcomers, start with basic stuff like accumulating bitcoin, learning to use a wallet, security etc.  Don't just dive in and ape into defi coins, wsb style.  It may suck that it feels like you are missing all the gains from the ""hot"" new coins, but it will equally hurt if you are just burning through your capital.
12. Look out for free crypto opportunities.  They key here is sorting out the gems from the scams.  This isn't just staking etc but also things like reddit moons and airdrops.  A lot of people are even ""airdrop farming"" whereby you have wallets that carry out certain activities deliberately to try and qualify for future airdrops.  Coin market cap earn and coinbase earn are two more.  Even something like the binance ""dust"" feature to turn dust into bnb is a way of generating some more bnb (even if its tiny).  Check out my previous post on free crypto and ways to get passive income
13. For farming, make sure you are using the right apps like zapper or apy vision to track all your positions, your yield and any impermanent loss.  That will also help with tax records down the track, should you need it.  Watch out for farming on the ETH network as your gas fees will chew up any gains if you have small positions.  Check out my previous post of sushi farming for how the rewards and gains work
14. Track all your numbers, your gains, your investments and portfolio change religiously, preferably in an excel document.  That way you'll know how you are performing and if something is going wrong.  Again, I wish I had done this more in 2018.
15. Have an ""emergency reserve"".  For me, this is actually my stock positions, many which are crypto related, but you could have gold or cash (I especially like the idea of something like stable coins lent on FTX at a decent interest rate).  If we get some kind of crypto turbo dump which is 40%, you can then have that as money on the side-lines ready to buy.
16. Constantly educate yourself.  For me, I still need 3-4 hours a day to research and learn about crypto.  I find crypto podcasts and even youtube vital sources of information, provided you are listening to the right people.  Mix up your education with news, technical strategies, trading updates, altcoin news and even just the general philosophy behind sound money and financial sovereignty.
17. If you win or lose on a trade, delete that coin from blockfolio immediately.  Why?  Because you have exited that position, and seeing it jump up again in price is just going to torment you.  You've made the decision to sell, don't even up revenge trading where you come back and try and get your losses back on the same trade.
18. Never margin trade UNLESS it is only because you want to minimise your funds at risk on an exchange.  Even then I'd avoid it.  Unfortunately many exchanges make this very hard to use - and there are confusing terms and default options which can rekt you (for example, positions that will drain your other funds instead of liquidiating the trade if falls too much).  In fact, I avoid almost all USD pairings and only trade BTC pairing, unless very special circumstances are in play (such as ripple being delisted from coinbase).
19. Never hold more than around 10 coins.  I used to have up to 40 at a time, it became impossible tracking them in terms of activity, prices, and god the horrors of trying to maintain enough wallets for them.  10 is enough diversification.  I used to have a ""bag"" of around 15 moonshots - that strategy never worked as even if one ""Gem"" actually made it big, the losses from the other ones cancelled out.  Typically if I had a huge gain from one of my coins, I sell back to BTC and waits for other opportunities.  This isn't Pokemon - don't try and ""catch them all"".
20. Falling in love with alt-coins is like falling in love at a stripclub.  Yes trade them.  But just be conscious that their chances of beating BTC long term are very unlikely.  Just look at all my 2013 gems (peer coin, feather coin etc).  Heck I bought World-Coin because I read about a ""bitcoin genius teenager"" who made millions from crypto and said World-Coin was the next bitcoin.  And I've made my mistakes as well going forward, holding on for dear life for nano (yes I know its fast and instant!) and grin.  I think the tech for both coins is great, that doesn't mean its a great trade.  If you want to marry your alt-coins then you will be lucky if you only lose half your money like a real world divorce :)
21. EDIT. Bonus one.  Always learn from your losses (and I have MANY).  I like to think of crypto as like a computer game where you are gaining new skills.  Think of RPG games like Baldur's Gate or Warcraft.  You can earn money or experience, and use that to gain new items or skills that protect you against certain things.  So maybe you lost $500 to a ""rug-pull""?  Well do your research and figure out how to avoid that next time.  Maybe you'll spend the next 2 weeks mad about it, but next time a potential rug-pull project comes along you'll dodge it - congratulations you now have learned ""immunity to rug-pulls"".   Keep learning and gaining more experience and you'll start avoiding all the traps.
22. EDIT 2:  You are going to have MANY scenarios where you see a coin that has gone x1000 or to some ridiculous crescendo, where you feel utterly compelled to buy to avoid missing out.  This is the obvious trap (if you want an example of this look at Safemoon right now.  Bitconnect was the one in 2017 and there are others).  At some point bitcoin or ethereum will do a similar run up, and many people outside crypto will do the same thing.  Yes this can be irresistible but you must resist the temptation - think of the cryptos has being a bunch of boats on the wharf, and there are thousands of boats.  Every day another hundred turn up.  Why are you going to try and jump across the water to get to the boat that is already leaving, when if you wait a bit another few dozen will turn up in five minutes?  You'll just fall in the water and miss out on those new boats!
23. If you must trade as a new-comer, I highly suggest trading the smaller / middle cap BTC pairs.  Not the USD or margin pairs.  Certainly not something like futures contracts on FTX.  Why?  Because if you are on bitmex / bybit / ftx etc you are swimming with the whales and sharks, quant funds, robo-traders and the like.  If you entered the casino for the first time in your life, would you immediately go to the blackjack table with James Bond and Dr Evil?  The smaller BTC pairs are more likely to have less experienced traders - my trades actually went positive once I moved from USD pairs on margin exchanges to spot BTC trades with altcoins.
24. Last edit before bed (I promise).  The chances are, crypto is still cyclical.  That means we will have another bear market, or at least a very long boring period of no gains.  If you have just joined crypto, you probably won't ""make it"" this cycle, as we may only have 6 months to a year to go.  I actually lost money (a lot) in BOTH the 2013 and 2017 bull markets (-50% and -85%, respectively).   All of my gains were made in the bear market when I was buying BTC and alts when BTC was in the 3ks.  The ""will you make it?"" test isn't coming now when the market seems to be going infinitely up and everybody is winning.  That test comes when everybody is selling and it seems like you are the only buyer.  And yeah, thousands of alt coins will suffer or die at that point.   So be around to scoop up the ashes - don't be the ashes!  This is all a larger part of learning to move with the cycles.

Anyway these are the ones that come to mind, hopefully that is helpful!  No doubt I'll edit this post and add a few more.",10418,2021-04-11 02:37:48,1307

For all new investors, let this be proof that no one knows anything at all concretely, all the time we are seeing ""experts"" and ""analysts"" predicting and being sure of things that are not real.

It is really good to read the news and stay informed, but we must always bear in mind this type of misinformation that affects a large part of investors.

There are still 17 days until the end of the year and all the predictions can happen although now we are in extreme fear and most think that we entered a bear market and that it was ""obvious"" that all this ""was coming"".

Nobody knows anything, if they knew how to anticipate the market all those who are giving ""advice"" would be millionaires and would not be writing nonsense.

It is not the first time that this has happened in the crypto world and it will not be the last, I think it is healthy to keep a memory of these attitudes since they influence much more people who are just starting to invest.

Left ""100k EOY tweets"" aside because there are too many to list here.

USDC,cryptocurrency,"Yes, SHIB can go to a dollar","It has come to my attention that some people think SHIB coins cannot reach a USD valuation of $1.00, but let me assure you that this is *simply not true!*

A recent post explained that, for SHIB to reach $1.00, it would require a market cap of 558 *trillion* USD, about 500x the market cap of BTC. By comparison, as of 2021 the total wealth on earth is [431 trillion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2021/06/10/worlds-wealth-hits-half-a-quadrillion-dollars/?sh=2cf9123b309d) USD.

However, a 558 trillion USD market cap does not require 558 trillion USD worth of purchases. A [recent study](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/revealed-how-much-money-it-takes-to-move-bitcoins-price-by-1) by Bank of America found that 100 million USD could move BTC's trillion-dollar market cap by 1% - therefore, only 10 billion USD (1% of BTC's current market cap) would be needed to double BTC's market cap.

SHIB would only require 15 such doublings to reach a market cap over 500 trillion USD, requiring approximately 10 trillion USD in liquidity to do so. So, all we need is 10 trillion dollars - a perfectly reasonable amount of cash!

**So the question is, how do we get 10 trillion dollars?**

No problem, let me introduce you to my friend, [1998-KU2](https://www.asterank.com/#152679). 1998-KU2 is a 4.7km-wide asteroid mainly comprised of [nickel, iron, and cobalt](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/03/aa32086-17/aa32086-17.html). 1998-KU2's component minerals have an estimated value of 80 trillion USD!

[Here he is, circled in red.](https://preview.redd.it/yc2xy3tc21781.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=146247e2624d3e13e52e1ceeadb33e09430f7a0f)

However, getting up there and mining those rare minerals won't be cheap - we'll need a rocket, mining equipment, a return vehicle, and some other seriously advanced technology. The estimated cost of all this is 70 trillion USD, leaving us with a healthy 10 trillion USD profit in cold, hard cash!

So all we need to do is go down to our local bank, get a small loan of 70 trillion dollars, build our rocket, swing by 1998-KU2, mine some minerals, return to Earth, sell the minerals for 80 trillion USD, repay our loan, place a SHIB buy order for 10 trillion USD, **and sit back and watch SHIB go to $1.00!**

Who'd have thought that, to go to the moon, you'd need to go to the asteroid belt first?",5822,2021-12-22 05:17:27,1510

Of course all of these things we already and confirmed to them we did. After this no reply was given anymore and I send multiple reminders, but only radio silence. When I opened up another ticket I immediately got the standard reply from a Oli which said:

**Backstory** : There was a coup in Myanmar(Burma) in February 2021. 99 percent of the national loathes the military. As of now there are two governments

1. The military regime (Holding power)
2. The exiled government (won the 2021 election, the cabinet members location unknown but rumoured to be in Thailand,Germany,US)[Daily Fights going on - guerrilla warfare, daily protests, civil strike, tons of atrocities committed by the regime](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/11/1105082)To read [about the coup](https://www.nytimes.com/article/myanmar-news-protests-coup.html)

Since the Military is in control, the junta has tight control over the banks and the internet.

USDC,cryptocurrency,"Crypto.com introduces Worldwide Account Protection Programme, protects victims of unauthorised transactions of up to USD$250,000","Just read the security report from Crypto.com in an official press release issued barely 3 days after the recent hacking.

I think this is impressive not just for CDC but for the crypto market in general, in building confidence in cryptocurrency. This is so vital considering how crypto is still held in suspicion by many.

To quote them:

>Crypto.com is introducing the Worldwide Account Protection Program (WAPP). WAPP offers additional protection and security for user funds held in the Crypto.com App and the Crypto.com Exchange.  
>  
>WAPP is designed to protect user funds in cases where a third party gains unauthorized access to their account and withdraws funds without the user‚Äôs permission. WAPP restores funds up to USD$250,000 for qualified users; terms & conditions apply.

Some noteworthy things you must do to qualify for the WAPP:

* Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all transaction types where MFA is currently available,¬†
* Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transaction,
* Not be using jailbroken devices,¬†
* File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; and¬†
* Complete a questionnaire to support a forensic investigation.

The WAPP will begin rolling out in select markets starting 1 February 2022.¬†

CDC has also :

1. migrated to a new 2FA infrastructure, with a longer term plan to migrate  to true Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
2. Introduced an additional layer of security on 18 Jan to add a mandatory 24-hour delay between registration of a new whitelisted withdrawal address, and first withdrawal.
3. Full audit of the entire infrastructure
4. Engaged with third-party security firms to perform additional security checks + threat intelligence
5. And of course, all affected customers have been fully reimbursed.

[Here's the link to the report.](https://crypto.com/product-news/crypto-com-security-report-next-steps)

EDIT: Sincere thanks for the awards!  
EDIT2: I really didn't expect this to blow up. Thank you all for the awards! I just want to add that, yes I am a CDC customer, but I also hold many other tokens and coins, and I'm well aware of the amount of suspicion and misunderstanding many people have regarding crypto. It's really important that, as time passes, the crypto world shows that it cares, it is relatable and it adds value. That's why I decided to share about this. I am also learning that other exchanges offer similar - but maybe it's not marketed as well. Marketing is awareness. And it's true that the way a service provider reacts to a crisis is key to its public perception. thanks for reading!",4202,2022-01-20 08:32:39,1751
USDC,cryptocurrency,Everyone Here is Seriously Missing Out on The Wonderful World of DeFi and Web3,"Sometimes I feel that this subreddit is still stuck in 2017 talking about dead coins, whereas there‚Äôs this whole wonderful world of defi and web3 filled with life changing gains that I never see talked about here. But I want that to change so I‚Äôm putting together this huge list of all the cool things you can do in defi and web3.

# Trustless Loans

Defi is revolutionary for this. With Maker (or many other protocols), you can deposit collateral & take a loan on your assets to use in the real world wherever. This process involves no bank, no intermediary fees and offers much higher yield than trad finance. In fact, Tesla just did a real estate backed loan with maker dao.

# Lottery

Want to join the lottery? Well, PoolTogether isn't just any lottery. It's a DeFi protocol allowing for ""no loss lotteries."" How? Users are able to deposit funds, & yield is given to a verifiably random address in the pool. Losers can then still withdraw their assets.

# Aave Flash loans

If I told you that you could get millions of dollars in assets in seconds, with no bank, with no collateral, and at no risk to the lender... I'd probably sound crazy, right? Well, flash loans on Aave are built to be repaid in the same tx, otherwise it'll revert and fail. You can do this to perform arbitrage trades and other cool things.

# Yield farms

Not interested? Do you prefer to just hodl your coins and not think about them? Why not earn some passive interest in the process! Head over to YFI & join the yield farms, with many different options to choose from. The YFI community works hard at developing strategies for their vaults, acting like a high interest savings account. Users can deposit & immediately start earning yield!

# DEX liquidity providing

Speaking of liquidity mining... Do you have assets that you‚Äôre bullish on and that you want to put to work? Many DeFi protocols such as Uniswap, Sushiswap, & Curve are in need of liquidity. Deposit tokens of your choice to start earning yield in different tokens, & earn trade fees on swaps! Careful though as this exposes you to impermanent loss.

# Lido (staked eth)

Do you hate having to worry about opportunity cost of locking up your eth? Of course, that's not a problem for DeFi. Simply access liquid staking derivatives in order to unlock liquidity and put it to use. sETH represents staked ETH on Lido. After depositing, these sETH can be used in DeFi.

# Curve

This protocol is an absolute behemoth with about $20 billion in TVL making it the largest protocol by total value locked. Visit Curve to start earning complex, double digit yields on your holdings. Curve has incentivized stablecoin pools, which people use to trade high volumes with minimal slippage, and even conduct arbitrage for yield.

You can stake your CRV tokens on convex finance to earn yields from curve trading volume and bribes from protocols trying to incentivize liquidity. This is a whole rabbit hole that I will make another post about.

USDC,cryptocurrency,The 2021 bullrun exit strategy,"**\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\***

I posted an update on Saturday Jan 8th

Hang in there everyone, no dip lasts forever.

**Disclaimer:** This exit strategy relies on a bunch of assumptions. The point of this post is not to debate those. If you think this bullrun will last well into 2022 or perhaps even longer, that's cool, you do you. What I'm about to describe is my own exit strategy. I'm not trying to convince you that it's better than your plan, my only hope is that there might be handful of people to whom this makes sense who can take something valuable from this post. As for the rest of you, best of luck, and I sincerely mean that.

**Thesis Statement:** I believe we are at the tail end of the bullrun that started after the March Covid crash of 2020. We have seen mindblowing gains on alts like Solana, Luna, Ada, Avax, Harmony, and many others. I believe that there's not much juice left in that lemon. The main reasons for this belief are:

\- **This isn't the ""cycle of mass adoption"".** This is actually a good thing, because literally none of the L1s in the top 100 are ready for mass adoption: Solana had to shut down for 17 hours because it buckled under the weight of transactions. Eth's answer to increasing traffic is to charge you $250 in gas for a uniswap transaction. Matic can barely handle the traffic it gets currently and transactions frequently remain 'pending' for hours or days. Cardano still doesn't have working smart contracts and Hoskinson himself essentially admitted that it can't scale without L2s. I could go on here, but you get the point.

\- **Governments all around the world have been printing money like it's a sport, and that didn't begin in 2020 with the onset of the pandemic, it began more than 10 years ago after the financial crisis.** A by-product of this has been record-low interest rates. This has fueled investment all over the planet, as is easily evidenced by a completely out of control housing market in most major markets and a stock market that has been basically 'up only' for ten years straight. Governments are now admitting that the current 4%-5% inflation rate is not sustainable. In order to get this back in line, the federal banks will have to raise interest rates. That means less money for all of us, because things like mortgages, car payments, credit card debt, etc. will all go up. And obviously, it will no longer make sense to take a loan to invest (and yes, people have definitely been taking loans to invest, simply because it made sense: you can take a loan from the bank for less 5% and put that money into index funds and you'll come out on top....at least for now).

\- **This whole space is dramatically overvalued.** Yes I know, market caps do not reflect the actual value of a company, but they do reflect the current level of speculation: we are in the kind of market where Tesla is worth more than the entire German automotive industry. Cardano is worth $77 billion dollars and it currently doesn't even function as an L1 smart contract chain. Dot is worth $50 billion dollars and barely has a working product. The point is that the current valuations reflect what these projects may become in the next 5 years. In other words, their valuations are based on speculation, not current capabilities.

**""Ok dude, get to the point already""** I believe that this December will see the crypto market go absolutely ballistic, fueled by holiday spending, euphoria, and an over confidence in a market that has already seen 10X gains in the last 3 months. It will crash in early 2022, most likely kicked off by a stock market crash as governments all over the word raise interest rates and announce efforts to contain their out of control spending that's resulted in debt levels our grand children will still be paying off.

**""Cool story bro, so what are you gonna do about it?""** At some point in late December (obviously depending on market dynamics at the time), I'm going to sell most of my crypto assets for stable coins and earn yield on stable coins. The US dollar is extremely unlikely to collapse. And if it does, the whole planet goes into a massive economic recession and crypto will not be spared. USD will be the safest asset to be in, save for perhaps gold. Here's what I will do step by step:

\- Deposit stable coin as collateral on a protocol such as anchor, earning interest

\- take stable coin loan against collateral, again earning to borrow (and even if you're no longer getting paid to borrow, the interest earned from lending will most likely outweigh the interest owed from borrowing, meaning on a net level, you're still making money)

\- Provide stable coin liquidity, e.g. USDC <> DAI pair, earning yield and compounding that yield into liquidity.

The rates currently available for doing this vary from platform to platform, but at the moment, you can easily get 20% APR doing this. If you're willing to risk doing this with smaller, less established platforms like Tranquil and Openswap on Harmony, you can get almost 100% APR). There are variations of the above, but that's the general gist.

**""And then what?""** I wait as my USD reserves grow. I use the time to research in an effort to identify alts that have a good chance of becoming winners in the next bull market. My focus will be on L1s that can actually scale to global demand without having to rely on imperfect L2 solutions. Once it becomes relatively clear that the market has reached the bottom (where it will probably stay for quite some time like it has in every other true bear market), I start to DCA, positioning myself for the next bull market, whether that comes in late 2022 or in 2024, I plan on being a part of it.

Thanks to those who read this entire wall of text, and to those who didn't, well, you're not reading this anyway ;)

**EDIT:** A few responses are misinterpreting the above as trying to 'time the market'. I wouldn't really call it that. If I was trying to time the market, I'd be trying to sell more or less the exact top. I know I won't be able to do that, and I'm not at all ruling out that after I sell, the market keeps pumping throughout January and maybe even longer. But I'm absolutely willing to forego gains at the very tail end of the market if it means not having to see my portfolio bleed like a slasher movie over the course of a few short days like it did in 2018.",3722,2021-11-09 20:34:19,3015
USDC,cryptocurrency,If you were starting today with 5k USD? ,"Hello r/CryptoCurrency

I want toget into the crypto space (yes, partly because of all the hype) mostly because I've been thinking about it for a long time. I'm not trying to time the market clearly as BTC is reaching an ATH.

I understand that the crypto space is very different from the traditional stock market, so I look at this as a risk-seeking investment.

I'm not trying to get rich quick, but I do want to experiencing buying some crypto.

So my question to you is that if you had 5k USD to buy a few different coins, what would you buy?

  
Edit: Wow! This is my first time interacting with this community and I must say thank you to everyone! I did not expect this sort of response. Looks like I have a lot to learn, so the 5k stays put and I learn all about how to acquire and setup a hardware wallet, along with DCA (had to google that!). This community is pretty cool :) ",439,2024-11-22 05:25:52,715

________________________________________________________________

That's right, everyone always talks about their portfolios, let's see if Redditors can pick a portfolio that'll outperform the rest (Or, alternatively, go down in flames) and leave it for a year. At the end of the year (November 5th, 12 months from now till the day) I'll cash out the proceeds and donate it to the 10 people who posted the comments that got the highest upvotes in this post - Or in other words, the people who ended up choosing the Coins that will be bought.

Last cycle, I converted 10,000 Moons into USD for this experiment, now it's up to you to choose what Cryptos it buys.


________________________________________________________________

**Here's the deal and the rules:**

- You comment on this thread. You can either comment a top level comment with a coin you think should be chosen, or you can support someone else's pick. If you are doing a top level (Coin pick) comment, **please explain why this coin should be chosen.**

- You list a coin available on Binance.com - It'll be the Casino I'm using for this experiment.

- The top 10 upvoted (In total votes) comments will have that Coin purchased as 10% of the total:

- [0.0353 BTC / 10 = 0.00353 BTC to 10 coins](https://i.imgur.com/S6cTs59.png) - Or about $50 USD/Coin.

- Coins will be purchased in order of upvotes. Will try to divide them evenly but the last place ones might lose out a little bit.

- Coins will be tracked each month in a post, which will coincide with the day after Moon Distribution. I'll try to make it funny and informative.

USDC,cryptocurrency,"I created a tool to better understand market cap potential of alt coins, because I needed it myself for my research. Published it as a website for anyone to use. No ads, no BS.","First post here! I'm a new comer to the world of crypto. As I was doing my research on alt coins I found market cap to be essential in understanding the relative size and the potential upside of different coins. I found myself constantly doing mental math using CoinMarketCap data, so I decided to build myself a little private website to help with all that! Example: ""_if coin X had market cap of coin Y, it would be worth $Z_"". I figured others are probably in the same position, so I published it yesterday for the world to use. :)

I proudly present to you **[thecoinperspective.com](https://thecoinperspective.com/)**!

**Features:**

- Supports the top 500 non-stable coins/tokens as per CoinMarketCap data. I can add more, if required.
- Quickly see impact of different market caps using a slider, as well as input a hypothetical amount of coins to calculate total worth.
- Supports multiple reference fiat currencies (USD,JPY,GBP,CHF,CAD,AUD,HKD,CNY)
- Coin data is auto-refreshed every 3 hours, including Fiat exchange rates
- Mobile friendly
- No ads, no spam (LPT: use uBlock Origin if you don't already)

USDC,cryptocurrency,"Real, mainstream crypto adoption is happening right now. You just haven't realized.","Yes, that's quite the title, I know. But after seeing the hundredth post on the frontpage talking about altcoins that have real use cases, I can't stop thinking about this one.

You all know Venezuela, right? The country with space-high inflation rates, the one that /r/cryptocurrency says crypto adoption is feasible. 

Well, it's finally really happening.

I'm Venezuelan, so let me explain some weird things about our economy. First, prices double every 3 months. Second, we don't have access to USD bank accounts in the country. And third, physical cash is scarce: Bolivares because you need a lot of them to pay for little, and USD because the ""dollarization"" isn't official, small change simply doesn't exist (coins, for example). This creates the perfect variables for digital, exact payment. This is where the Reserve Protocol comes in.

We have been using some digital payments app since a while ago, apps like Zelle, PayPal or Transferwise. The problem with those apps is that they often close accounts in Venezuela to avoid problems with the US government. Simply put, those companies just didn't want to deal with the problem that is Venezuela related legislation.

Enter [Reserve.](https://reserve.org/) The team at Reserve created a stablecoin alongside an easy to use app for mainstream use. The app allows people to deposit Bolivares (the local currency) from their bank account and instantly exchange them for dollars (RSV stablecoins!). You might be thinking, well, that isn't that big of a deal, is it? Thing is, it is. Venezuelans can't just exchange Bol√≠vares to USD legally because there aren't any bank accounts in USD inside Venezuela. The only way to save in USD would be to open an account in Panam√° or risk your money getting lost in Zelle or PayPal. The app allows people to send RSV, pay with RSV, receive any crypto and convert it to RSV or Bolivares and so on. Reserve is literally saving people from hyperinflation.

Well, why do I say mainstream crypto adoption is happening? Because people aren't paying in bolivares anymore. It is estimated that in 2020, 55% of transactions were made in foreign currency, and that number just keeps growing everyday. Now, the great part.

**The Reserve app has more than 100k downloads.** **People are using** **crypto, not as a way to invest, not as a store of value, but as it was intended: a currency.**  And it's happening right in front of us, but we're too worried about the price going up or down so much that we missed the real reason crypto is here: to serve as a currency when fiat fails us. In my case, fiat failed me. And crypto, for me and many more, is the way.",6845,2021-05-30 13:45:45,828

While I have your attention, I want to take 5 seconds of your time and bring some exposure to something that is threatening our existence as the human race.

If everyone reading this planted a fruit tree, or even some wild flowers, we could save the bees.

While you are at it, planting a fruit tree has been shown to be one of the best investments on the planet. There's pretty much no investment on the planet that is more financially lucrative (while still being nearly bullet-proof safe) than planting a fruit tree.

You can get a tree at an end of sale auction for literally 5-10 bucks, and that tree will produce THOUSANDS of dollars of fruit for you in it's lifetime. Go spend $200 bucks at an end of season sale, plant 10-20 trees (if you have room), and that $200 will be worth tens of thousands of dollars of saved money.

**I also expended the ""now what happens"" section, to explain how these pullbacks are a good thing, make crypto more stable, and why we keep seeing larger ceilings after every pullback... this stuff is really important for you to make money on this thing, if that's your goal....**

I've made a similar post in a few spots, and this is something that is absolutely critical for people to understand... what impacts price, and what is going on lately. Price has only a very minor correlation with money invested, and a major correlation with opinion. 

... and Humans are an emotional bunch.

So what drives price of any commodity, crypto, gold, pizzas, whatever? The money invested in it, right? Kind of, but not really. What if I told you that you could theoretically raise bitcoin from $15k to $20k by spending $1, and lower it from $25k to $1k by spending the same $1? Crazy right?

**AN EXAMPLE**

This is going to start out slow, I want to make sure I get everyone on the same page before I pick things up and lift the curtain. Stick with me here....

This is an example to help illustrate why prices aren't driven by money invested, but rather consensus and opinion. Lets imagine the following exists (we will use bitcoin as an example, but this is how everything on the planet works)

Lets say Bitcoin is currently priced at $10k (the last sale). From $11k to $99k, every $1k there is someone with a sell order of 1 full bitcoin. From $9k to $1 dollar, every $1k on the way down there is someone with a buy order of 1 full bitcoin.

So, right now if you wanted to buy bitcoin you have several options... meet the lowest seller's price of $11k, or, put your own buy order up, above the highest buyer's bid order (overcut them). If you decide to just place an order, the price doesn't change. If you decide the buy the $11k bitcoin, now bitcoins value is $11k, with a new lowest sell offer of $12k, and a highest buy bid of $10k. Someone else comes in an overcuts the buy bid and puts 1 BTC for sale for $11k. No trades are made until someone matches a buy/sell.

Okay, that's kindergarten stuff, most people here understand that. So how much money drove the price up in this situation? $11k, and BTC price raised 11/10, 1.10, or 10% from the last sale. Now the entire marketcap of BTC raised 10% (last sale multiplied by circulating supply). So it takes $11k to drive a 10% increase, right? Not at all. Lets look at what happens when news is released.

News comes out that Warren Buffet thinks bitcoin is a scam, a bubble, and he wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because he only invests in things he understands and he doesn't understand crypto. People panic everywhere, and believe ""this guy is smart, I'm overvaluing this thing"".

Suddenly people don't want to buy this scam anymore, and the buy orders for $11k, $10, and $9k are taken down. 

At the same time, the people wanting to sell start to panic and just want out. The guy at $32k (who just had that offer up ""just incase it moons"") drops down to $11k sell order. The guy at $12k, who was the lowest, now undercuts him to $10k. 

The other buyers see the sellers undercutting and think that if these people want out, why am I buying in. The $8k guy pulls his offer, and so do the $7k, $6k and $5k guys. The highest offer is now $4k. 

The sellers panic further and the $14k guy undercuts the $10k guy and puts up a $9k sell. The $15k, 17k and 11k guys all see this flurry of panic and now a storm undercutting is triggered, to $8k, $7k, and $6k. The $8k order pulls his again and goes down to $5k. 

The price on the buy and sell orders has moved around a ton, but no sales have actually happened yet. Technically, BTC is still ""worth"" $11k, and the market cap reflects that. All this horseshit has happened, and it only happened in 10 seconds, but the price hasn't moved yet. 

The $27k guy wakes up and checks his phone. He had a $27k offer just incase the price moved also, and he also only has a tiny infinitesimal fraction of a BTC. Well, he decides ""he's out"" and fills $1 worth of the part of the $4k guys buy offer.

The latest price information is now updated, and BTC fell from $11k to $4k price per BTC with the movement of a single dollar.

This is exaggerated example, but this is what moves price. Not money in vs money out. The ONLY THING that moves price is perception.

**OPINION FLOW AND NOT MONEY FLOW**

Now the above example only happens if everyone simultaneously believe the same thing... this the asset they are holding is a steaming turd. What happens in reality is there's no black and white, it's shades of gray. It's flow in vs flow out. But again, not flow MONEY, but rather OPINIONS.

If 66% of the holders of something all of a sudden unanimously decide that their asset is overvalued, then they panic sell. Even if 33% of the people decide they are going to buy up as much as these panic sellers sell, if the panic is strong enough, and they are slitting eachother's throat to sell, then the buyers just happily sit and let them do that, and time their buys in. Very little money has to actually change hands in order for this price to crash, all that matters is the FLOW OF OPINION has to be swift and violent, and in majority. The sellers will leapfrog eachother on the way down, faster than the buyers scoop up their sales, and the net result is a crashed price.

Note, this happens both ways... fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) as well as overhyped FOMO (Fear of missing out). 

**So now what happens?**

Time goes by and all holders opinions of their asset hasn't changed. They still think it's worth $11k and they got great deals scooping up what these sellers were selling. The weak hands have left the market and have been replaced with holders. Overall, now a higher percentage of holders believe in the product they are holding and are unwilling to sell for the panic prices of the last week. Panic sellers were also replaced by new money, people who have wanted in for a while and are now in on their perceived ground floor.

Also, people who bought BTC at $1 ten years ago and have been looking for an exit to cash profits have now been replaced by either long term holders, or by these new people who are thrilled to have finally entered, and they are looking to hold long. 

So what happens on pullbacks? The number of people waiting to jump off the ship has decreased. The new ground floor is established. Are we done? Who knows, this could go on for another year, but what matters is that people who want off are getting off and people that want on are getting on. 

People who have panic sold and never believed in this in the firstplace... people who have wanted out for 10 years... they have been replaced by people who are now getting in on THEIR GROUND FLOOR, and are going to be holding long. The market is suddenly increasingly more stable today than it was yesterday, even though prices are down. 

**This is a good thing.** This is why crypto keeps bouncing back from pullbacks and reaches new higher ceilings and floors each time. Old money who wanted out, and new panic holders, they are gone. They are replaced with adopters, holders, believers in this technology. These people aren't selling anytime soon, because they believe that this thing is going to revolutionize the world. Every crash brings more of these people in, and removes more panic sellers out. 

**Moving forward**

Now news releases start coming out about how stock ETFs are being created, NASDAQ index funds, bank support, government support. Companies are using this tech, and companies who use blockchain for transportation are putting non-blockchain companies out of business. 

The people on the outside looking-in feel they are missing out. They now start coming in and buying. They start overpricing eachother on their buy orders, and eventually it gets close enough to a sell order that someone decides they are just going to meet the sell price. The sale goes through.

Sellers (HODLERs) see this action, and they start pulling sell orders off the table almost as fast as they fill. Sure some trades go through, and incoming money is driving the price up as market orders are filled. But what's also happening is people are seeing this flurry of volume, and sellers are pulling sell orders and placing them higher. 

Junk coins and pump and dump scam coins are dying by the millions. In their ashes, good solid technology projects whose coins have fundamental economic reasons for growth, these are rising. Corporate partnerships continue forming. The real world continues to create actual use cases. Companies start storing more and more corporate information on blockchain. Public companies use blockchain to store scientific research (See Canadian Research Council announcements), and blockchain acts as a Library of Alexandria. People can travel out of country without any monetary exchange, using their chosen cryptocurrency to buy the things they need abroad. The world is slowly actually USING this technology. 

Money is coming in, but more importantly, OPINION IS CHANGING. Literally nothing could have happened in terms of fundamentals, partnerships, etc... this can all be driven entirely emotional, so long as it's wide-spread and strong. Infact, the market could THEORETICALLY rebound in this way from $4000/BTC to $1 MILLION PER BITCOIN by the sale of ONE PENNY. $4000 sound low? Does that number make you uncomfortable? We may go that low. We may not. If we do, I'm not panicking and selling, I'm buying more.


**SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS? and where are we going?**

A lot of new money has come in from Nov-Jan, and they don't really know what they are investing in. Sure some of them have done great research and are smart investors but most people aren't and isntead they are buying Symbols and Names and trading on speculation. They are treating their favorite coins like a sports team, and will follow them irrationally off a cliff.

These new people came in and invested in cryptocurrency because their OPINION was heavily influenced in Nov, Dec, Jan, from media. They saw this money making machine called crypto. They were willing to pay huge, ride the wave up, keep buying, etc. They were ""ground floor adopters"" and were going to get rich.

They outnumber the old money by A LOT. Their OPINION MATTERS. It matters the most.

To keep this in perspective, they are also a VAST MINORITY of ""new money"" that will enter the game in the next decade. This cycle will continue over and over and over. 

Their opinion rose nearly unbounded and price rose accordingly. Market cap rose from 10B to 750B, and it could have been VERY LITTLE actual money that did this. How much did it need to be though? Literally ONE PENNY, theoretically. All that matters in moving price is MOMENTUM OF OPINION. I believe it has been estimated that as low as 6B USD was responsible for the bull rush.

These people then started hearing ""Bubble"", ""Scam"", Fake news about governments banning. They don't understand how technology wins, always. Crypto is beyond government control. If they could have stopped Bitcoin they would have done it already. 

**WHO IS DRIVING ALL THIS?**

Most investment opportunities go first to ""accredited investors"". You need to have multimillions in order to get in on the ground floor for most stock IPOs, and we're seeing that start to happen with coin ICOs. Bitcoin was a joke for the first few years, while lunatics picked it up. At this point, it was really too late to get in ""early"", and who would have wanted to anyways, it was all still a joke. So Wallstreet, banks, governments have generally watched on the sidelines as average Joes who were crazy enough to be early adopters and toss $100 on fake internet money slowly became millionaires. 

Not only that, but the idea of blockchain started to become understood. The power and value in it became understood. Not only as a way to track ""monetary value"" but for many other applications as well. Platforms were created, business uses brainstormed, products started being made. This thing started taking off, and wasn't a joke anymore. But regardless, big money wasn't in on the ground floor. They have stakeholders opinions to think of, and what do they say to investors when they lose all their money on magic internet points?

But they have woken up now. This thing has ""popped"" many times now and keeps recovering. This thing won't die. could they have been wrong all along? If they want in, how do they get in? They are no dummies, they have been controlling the world their whole lives? Look at the media experiment that Trump is doing? He is testing just how we work... you can do literally anything and we remember it for like 30 seconds, until the next news story comes out. We change opinions very easily. We are swayed very easily. We are their puppets. Media controls the world. They know their way in.

They have ONE WEAPON against cryptocurrency.

YOUR OPINION OF IT.

And they know it.

**Media.**

That's why FUD is so powerful and needs to be respected. It's why we need to read more than titles on news articles. We need to question what we read, **whether it's good news or bad news**. We need to think about ""what are the motives of the person saying this to me"". Does the government have a conflict of interest when they state that crypto is gambling? Do they have skin in the game? 

What about wall street? Does WEISS ratings possibly have incentive to come out with poor ratings? Do banks have incentive to lock accounts in order to ""protect"" customers from ""unsafe investments"" when their entire business model revolves around holding as much of your money as possible and making money off it? Do you think banks have any super secret hidden interest in preventing you from storing your money elsewhere? I'm not sure, maybe you can critically think about that.

Just understand that this goes both ways. When crypto is booming and Fox news is showing people how to buy $4 ripple on prime time, you may want to start putting in some stop loss orders. When the suicide hotline is stickied at the top of /r/cryptocurrency and everyone is panic selling, you may want to start picking up some firesale deals. 

So, the question is this... Is crypto undervalued or overvalued at it's price today? Where is the price going long term? **I'm not talking about it's use case**, I'm talking about in the **court of public opinion**, where is THAT going? Because THAT is what is going to drive price in the future.

Without a crystal ball, this is of course impossible to know. Do your own research and form your own opinion. It could very well be that the technology having a use-case will in and of itself drive opinion, and thus price. But make sure you understand that it's not the technology itself, it's not the value of the business itself, it's not the use case itself that will drive price, it is the publics OPINION of that thing which drives price. They are intertwined, but they are NOT the same thing.

TLDR: VERY VERY little money has to move around in order to swing prices drastically, up or down. Money in and out doesn't drive price, OPINION does. How do you let the news you read impact your opinion?How are you being played (on both sides, shilling and FUD).

Something is only worth what people think it's worth. Often that's based on reality, value, business, money, but often it's entirely emotional.

[Structure your portfolio in a balance, intelligent way, using risk methodology.](https://www.investinblockchain.com/cryptocurrency-investment-risk-management/). Invest money you are willing to lose. Support legitimate technology and teams who are actively driving their product to completion, coding, and marketing. Stop trying to make money overnight in pump and dump scams, or pyramid schemes. 

Every day, take one coin, do a deep dive on it, learn it inside and out. Look into their team and their past. Do that every day for a year, and you just learned 365 coins inside and out. Ask yourself the following key questions:

Have those members consistently jumped ship on previous projects? Is that where you want to invest in? Is their team capable of executing on their vision? Are they trying to solve world hunger, and their team is a few 16 year olds in a garage? How active is their github? Are they adding chunks of code regularly, or is a ghost town? Are they marketing their product at all? Or is marketing the only thing they are doing? 

What are the economics of their coin itself? Is it required to be used to gain access to their technology? Are there burns? How premined is it, and what portion do the founders hold? 

What about their vision? Are they trying to solve a problem that needs to be solved? What are the economics of that problem and how much money does the solution potentially save clients?

These are all questions you should be asking when you give your money to someone else. We're a lot more stable than we were - a correction was bound to happen. Too much early money wanted to cash in profits. These people have been replaced by new money who is holding on their own ground floor. The whole industry in general is still in very early stages. Rest assured that anyone reading this is still very much an early adopter. Just make sure you are investing in actual technology, and supporting capable teams, and not buying air. Buy the Googles and Amazons of Crypto, not the pets.com or flooz.com of cryptos.

Happy investing everyone.

So yeah, once again, fuck you Bitboy Crypto and other Youtubers.","There was a great post on this subreddit yesterday, talking about Youtubers destroying beginners in the crypto space, and I couldn't agree more with that post. ([Link to that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mc60c0/to_bitboy_crypto_and_related_youtube_clickbaiters/))

I get constant recommendations in my Youtube of this clickbaity fuckers, even though I have selected ""Don't show anymore"" on Youtube, but I guess it doesn't care. And lucky me...because Bitboy has released a video titled: ""My $10 Million Crypto Portfolio REVEALED (Shocking Holdings)"".

First of all, there is nothing shocking in your holdings, besides the amount of coins that you have already accepted a sponsor of and didn't disclose it, which is illegal.

And this got me thinking of some coins that he has proclaimed that have a ""100x"" potential, so I decided to watch the video, and see if he puts his money where is mouth is. (I only know where he puts his mouth in for those thumbnails)

Well Lo and Behold...that must be one of the biggest self exposes I have seen in a while.

He has SEVERAL videos titled something similar to: ""BEST Low Cap Crypto Gem of 2021"", and GUESS WHAT!! He doesn't hold 2/10 coins that he pumps in those videos. But he does hold 300k USD...hmmm, where has that come from?

I know that one of his sponsored videos was about SOUL, where he named it the BEST LOW CAP GEM, and HE DOESN'T OWN IT. This is more than proof that he dumps soon after his video airs.

Frontier...same thing...naming it the coin with the best potential he has seen, and it is only 0.4% of his portfolio??? Yeah right. See it for yourself if you are interested...

USDC,cryptocurrency,"Crypto.com is price gouging on transfer fees, BIG time, about 15x and 154x more than coinbase, is this a red flag?","This is incredibly super shady and is going to make me think twice when using [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) app platform again.  Right now, 12:10 pm PST time I'm trying to withdraw ETH and BTC.

On [L2Fees.info](https://L2Fees.info) it has it ETH listed as 0.36 USD. Even on their own CDC defi app the meter is at all time low of 12.

However when I tried to withdraw, the fee was 0.004 for ETH which is 4.30 USD.  I thought it was a mistake so I went to coinbase and tried withdrawing and it was 0.000252 ETH, so 0.27 USD.  The price difference here is literally 15x difference WTF?

Ok tried bitcoin instead. On [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) it wants to charge me 0.0006 that translate into 11.59 USD. On coinbase its  0.00000388 , 0.075 cents USD.  WTF WTF.  Even on a busy weekday coinbase was about .25 cents and these fuckers wants to charge 11.59 ?

Here is as summary

ETH

|estimated on [L2Fees.info](https://L2Fees.info)|0.36 USD|
|:-|:-|
|crypto.com|4.30 USD|
|coinbase|0.27 USD|

Bitcoin

|crypto.com|11.59 USD|
|:-|:-|
|coinbase|0.075 USD|

&#x200B;

I think this is very concerning. Maybe they are just trying to price gouge however I'm wondering if they are purposely making it unattractive to withdraw for some nefarious reason - what they worry about?

This is very mess up and people should really consider this point when trying crypto.com.

TLDR:

[crypto.com](https://crypto.com) app is charging 15x and  154x more in withdrawal fees ( eth, BTC respectively ) then coinbase or other projected price from public sites.  We are talking about 7 cents compared to 11.59 dollars here so its not a trivial rounding error.

\- sorry for the spelling/grammar I'm so mad right now I can't even type correctly.

&#x200B;

So, while this would be a great chart for pretty much any stock, and Monero had pretty decent gains this month, it's still the black sheep of the challenge. Strange to say that when it's gone up almost 400% in the last 6 months, but that's pretty sleepy in the current Crypto market. Maybe Monero is predicting a bear market to come.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Again, this doesn't look like a bad chart, right? XRP more than doubled to start the month, retraced when Bitcoin fell, and leveled off. It's actually double what it was last month, and up 6x overall! Unfortunately, that's pretty bad here.

&#x200B;

**#8 - IOTA - $391.66**

Like a lot of coins this month, IOTA rocketed up and almost doubled to start it, then cratered with Bitcoin and leveled off. It's up a little bit from last month, but nothing special.

&#x200B;

**#7 - ETH - $395**

[You don't see charts much nicer than this, folks.](https://preview.redd.it/s8p7otckv8x61.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e40046c0b92a7aa772330817ba07ac62a605c7d)

Oh baby, what a month for ETH. It's basically a straight ride up into the stratosphere, with ETH hitting multiple all time highs all the way up. It barely noticed as Bitcoin went down 25% and then soared into the distance. Funny thing is, despite this amazing monthly chart, ETH still sits near the bottom of this challenge. 8x gains just aren't good enough here, I guess.

&#x200B;

**#6 - LTO - $418.55**

&#x200B;

Not the prettiest chart. LTO fans were rewarded with a brief $0.90 all time high before an awful 55% drop in value. A big rebound pushed it back up, only to level off somewhere in the middle. One of the first coins to see a significant monthly downgrade in the challenge, the other one was XRP during the original stages of the lawsuit.

NANO spent most of April plagued by a spam attack upon the network - Exchanges couldn't trade it, people couldn't use it. It remained flat volumewise until hope of a fix on the horizon came, then shot up, basically doubling in price overnight. Since then, it's gone the way of other coins in retracing. Still, it's up a great amount on the month!

&#x200B;

**#4 - ADA - $663.85**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Bet you can't tell the difference between this and Bitcoin.](https://preview.redd.it/jxg8m84ax8x61.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=115f067ef61e4224573c317f1c72e601edeaf67f)

ADA largely followed Bitcoin to the letter this month, rising with the highs, falling with the lows, and leveling out almost exactly to what Bitcoin did. It even ended up slightly higher than last month exactly the same as Bitcoin did.

&#x200B;

**#3 - VET - $927.46**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Strong sentiment creates mountains.](https://preview.redd.it/k0wmt7inx8x61.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dc40fd14ee85ccdf0aac0172156932ca23dab6e)

In a particularly strong month, VET almost tripled even during the decline of Bitcoin, obliterating all time highs until finally leveling off on a more realistic level. Still up double on the month though, so fans of the project have good reason to smile at the level it's stayed at.

&#x200B;

**#2 - SOL - $1176.97**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Hard to get much better looking charts than this.](https://preview.redd.it/mkn2lld4y8x61.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=c605876c6ae6a4bf844283b9421bf73bb2df9a60)

SOL doubled this month, which seems like a pretty damn good month, until you realize that it's been **doubling almost every single month.** Not even joking here. SOL started the project at $2 and is now solidly over $40, that's crazy.  That's **over 20x gains in 6 months.**  Which of course, makes you wonder why it's at #2. Well, this leads us to, of course..

&#x200B;

**#1 - DOGE - $14,461.34**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[This may be getting a bit silly.](https://preview.redd.it/7f98cqv4z8x61.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=14286022b7f28b3a215aef4ec727b1eb424f278e)

&#x200B;

Alright, so, I think we've hit peak Shibe.  Not really much to say about this chart other than it's utterly ribonkulous. Let's be real here. It's gone up over 10x.

This month.

It's up almost 300x since the beginning of the challenge. 6 months ago.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Our portfolio ended last month at $$4,694.02, giving a total gain of **$13859.30 in March.**

If the $500 (10,000 moons) had been left in moons, they would currently be worth $**$1400.**

If the $500 had been left in BTC (0.0353 \* $54,192), it would be worth $**1912.97**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Quite obviously, the portfolio has outperformed basically everything. It's not even remotely close. However, moons doubled over the last month, so they at least put up a bit of a fight.

&#x200B;

Congrats to  [u/CalculatedLuck](https://www.reddit.com/u/CalculatedLuck)   for VET (3rd place) and  [u/arika2411](https://www.reddit.com/u/arika2411-) for SOL (2nd place) this month!

HOWEVER.

[u/TheRealMotherOfOP](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheRealMotherOfOP)   \- ***I'M GOING TO OFFER THIS ONLY ONCE, DUE TO THE CURRENT CRAZINESS WITH DOGE.***

I can cash you out of the challenge right now, and we can replace DOGE with the highest voted answer in this thread. I will put another $50 in moons in and people here can pick another one to fight with the pack.

If you don't choose to accept this one time deal, I will stick to the original terms of the challenge and distribute you the returns on November 5th.

Please let me know if you want to accept it. At almost $15,000 USD, the $50 spent in November can buy you a new car, or something else you'd enjoy in life. Think about it. :)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

To everyone else - If our Shibe chooses to accept the deal, please feel free to suggest another Coin to take its place, and more importantly, ***why that coin should be in the challenge.***

***That coin must also be available on Binance.***

See you in June!",105,2021-05-05 07:24:38,143

And CoinFLIX has tokenised this debt to another debt, and sold it to users who are not even aware of the situation by promising 20% returns. Unbelievably scummy","News is just coming  in that ""a wealthy individual"" has been liquidated on CoinFLIX and owes the company $47m USDC. The CEO of CoinFLIX confirmed this so far, and has said they have issued a notice of default to Ver.

USDC,cryptocurrency,I think I finally understand bitcoin.,"It's a silent project that operates in the background. There's no face to it. The founders created it and walked away. It's like an elegant clock set into motion that continues to tick. There's no promise of some complex protocol to come 3, 5, or 10 years down the road. It does what it's supposed to now without self promotion from the founders. Since it doesn't need self promotion to thrive, it doesn't fall victim to the vices of marketing from greedy, charismatic leaders, with overly complex projects. Sure, there's Saylor and Novogratz that sometimes fall into that role. But bitcoin doesn't need them to survive and won't need them when they die. The project works now. It does what it's supposed to and it'll continue to do what it's supposed to. It's the money of the future of our science fiction novels.

There's no Krypto Kris marketing shitty debit cards. There's no charismatic Do Kwon doing a Forbes, Steve Jobs photo shoot with a black t-shirt and a white background. There's no J Powell magically expanding the money supply with a cobol fueled wand, creating a 9 trillion USD balance sheet out of thin air.

BTC takes out the corruption of humans, because the humans that created it stepped away. Sure, people will build corrupt systems around it, but BTC itself is a simple, pure, and elegant vehicle silently ticking away in the background until the ticking becomes so loud that no one can ignore it.",2282,2022-05-12 14:18:01,921
USDC,cryptocurrency,"We all know ETH fees are high. Here's why it's happening, how to save money, and what is being done about it going forward.","Full disclaimer: I own some ETH. I've seen a lot of posts here and in /r/ethereum talking about high fees. I've also seen a lot of extremely misleading statements here and there about how high fees are right now and will try and simplify things a bit. I'll do my best to remain impartial, and feel free to correct me and I'll edit my post. All plans are subject to change, the following is based on my current understanding and recollection of developer statements.

>What is happening?

* ETH fees are high right now. The best place to see gas costs (how much you'll need to pay for a transaction vs how quickly you want it) is here: https://ethgasstation.info/

* Smart contracts and ERC-20 tokens consume much more gas than a basic transfer. While a typical transfer might be $3 a poorly written smart contract could consume $100 in gas. This variation leads to lots of confusion on various forums. An absolute metric crap ton of tokens run on ETH, so ETH being congested causes lots of downstream effects, tokens that consume lots of gas are disproportionately effected.

>Why is this happening?

 * [Utilization is through the roof right now](https://txstreet.com/v/eth-btc). At post time ETH is achieving 16.14 TPS vs BTC's 4.00. Despite being 4 times faster the demand for on-chain (L1) transactions is overwhelming. At the bottom of [this page, make sure to scroll down](https://ethgasstation.info/index.php) you can see that blocks are at 100% right now. That means people are constantly outbidding each other to make it in.

 * At post time [Uniswap](https://ethgasstation.info/gasguzzlers.php) is the biggest gas guzzler. People are using Decentralized Exchanges (dex'es) a ton and its consuming a huge chunk of block space and people are paying a premium for it.

>How can I save money?

 * ETH demand fluctuates heavily throughout the day, it's not uncommon for fees to drop 10x in an hour. If you are not in a hurry waiting a bit for a slow period and broadcasting a median gas transaction can save you a TON of money

 * Some wallets/apps are designed to be super user friendly, and unfortunately they hardcode the fastest possible gas costs for a good user experience (UX). Unfortunately that's a very bad idea when gas is high and only causes rates to climb even more. EIP-1559 will fix this, more on that later

 * Don't interact with smart contracts if you don't have to. It sucks, I know. But the fact is that using a smart contract is way more expensive than normal transactions. When gas is a fraction of a penny nobody cares, but its not right now and this is where we are. Last I checked, L1 [ETH](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_transaction_fee) transfers are still cheaper than [BTC](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee). Not much of a consolation, but it's not a *total* disaster yet. EDIT: It appears the last 2 days ETH has flipped BTC on transaction costs. $17 USD still seems really really high, as of post-time a $5 transaction would go through within a few minutes)

>What is being done about this? (sorted by est delivery date)

 * Berlin upgrade: Est 1-2 months, will adjust gas costs of various transactions for certain core operations. Should help fees overall on many contracts.

 * EIP-1559: Est ""this summer, but maybe Q3"": A huge overhaul to the fee system. Block sizes are FLEXIBLE, targeting 50% full. When a block exceeds 50% full the base fee increases. When it drops below 50% the base fee decreases. Fees are burned (nice deflationary side effect). This means a few things: A) Spikes in transactions can make the next block instead of clogging the mem pool B) costs are MUCH more easy to calculate, and block include time estimation is much easier. C) The improved predictability/include time means shitty apps won't have a reason to set absurd fees for a good UX, driving ""gas inflation"" like we see now. There's a lot more to EIP-1559, but that's the gist of how it should impact transactions

 * 2.0 Phase 0: Already live, but the beacon chain won't impact 1.0 until ""the merge"". Baseline TPS should be higher than 1.0, and its also environmentally friendly :)

 * 2.0 Phase 1: Est end of 2021, Sharding will first scale to 64 shards (eventually 1024) for a 64x scaling effect on the beacon chain. 

 * The Merge: Some call this Phase 1.5, but it is planned for 2022. This will move ETH 1.0 as a shard on to 2.0, and all finality will occur on the beacon chain. At this point ETH's core TPS should be 64-100x faster than what we have today

 * 2.0 Phase 2: Est end of 2022/2023, Execution Environments aka sharded smart contracts allow for smart contracts to share data across shards so that DeFi/Dex'es etc benefit from 2.0's massive scalability

>What other out-of-order improvements are coming?

 * Various L2 technologies are already live, and several smart contracts are upgrading to them now. This will let you pay on L1 to ""get in"", then perform a lot of cheap transactions on L2. Right now every trade on uniswap clogs L1. When it runs on L2 all those trades are off-chain and gas fees are only driven up by deposits/withdrawals. This should have a massive impact on overall gas costs. The good news is the insane fees on some contracts act as an INCENTIVE to get L2 up and running faster.

I know a lot of people are unhappy with the current situation, but a lot of progress has been made and a lot of exciting progress is on the horizon! I hope this post helps :)",4746,2021-02-04 22:47:15,609

USDC,cryptocurrency,"The top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence: the updated version","It's been 6 months since my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lg1yhv/for_the_newcomers_the_top_50_cryptocurrencies/) trying to sum up the biggest cryptos in a few words. I feel like an updated version is long due and so here we are.

As usual, if something is wrong or you would like to make a correction, feel free to comment. It's obviously hard to sum up each project in a few words, but I tried my best.

Terms used:

* If I refer to layer-2 solutions, that means a protocol or framework built on top of an existing blockchain and trying to increase transaction speed or scaling.
* [PoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work): Proof of Work
* [PoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake): Proof of Stake

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009 and since then it has become much more of a Store of Value than a currency, given its scarcity and high security, although layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network allows for fast and cheap transactions.
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** the coin of the Ethereum blockchain, the first smart contract platform and the one having the biggest ecosystem of decentralized applications around: since ETH price is used to pay fees to interact with the network, a bigger ecosystem means higher demand. It is (and will be) used for staking in Ethereum 2.0 (which is PoS).
3. **Tether (USDT):** the most discussed stablecoin around, pegged to the dollar price although many believe it is not fully backed: for this reason its market cap has been decreasing for the first time ever and other stablecoins are gaining traction.
4. **Binance Coin (BNB):** the official Binance coin and the one used to pay fees on the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain like Ethereum but less decentralized and with cheaper fees (not counting any layer 2 solutions).
5. **Cardano (ADA):** the coin of the PoS blockchain Cardano, created by the Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and developed strictly following peer-reviewed research, which slowed down development. Lots of partnerships and a big community make it one of the biggest ETH contenders.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** a centralized coin trying to redefine online payments, has had a rough time after the SEC went after it but seemingly it's coming out on top.
7. **USD Coin (USDC):** another stablecoin tied to the dollar and managed by the company Circle. Considered more trustworthy than Tether, it's been growing non-stop adoption-wise.
8. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** such wow, even higher ranking than last time. *sigh*
9. **Polkadot (DOT):** it's the coin of Polkadot, a multichain protocol aiming to connect different chains, both public and private, allowing to transfer data between one another or to create new custom blockchains. ChainLink's oracle pallet and Kusama are examples of projects built on top of it.
10. **Binance USD (BUSD):** another stablecoin pegged to the dollar, managed by Binance in partnership with Paxos.
11. **Uniswap (UNI):** the first token on the list, it's used to govern the decentralized trading protocol Uniswap, probably the biggest and most known DeFi application built on Ethereum.
12. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** a fork of Bitcoin trying to increase scalability and lower transaction fees increasing the blockchain block size, which achieves these features but reduces [decentralization](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f32dac47-a7a6-4e5d-af5b-28e4f1d87287).
13. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin younger brother, been around since 2011. It's based on the Bitcoin code but with some tweaks, lowering transaction speed and cost, many sees it as the ""silver"" of crypto since it's been around for so long.
14. **Chainlink (LINK):** between one Ganon and the other Link is also the official token of ChainLink, a network that basically bridges off-chain data with smart contracts: an example is Synthetix, a derivatives protocol that uses Chainlink to get the price feed of a certain asset on their smart contract.
15. **Solana (SOL):** one of the latest Ethereum contenders, launched in 2020 and offering possibly the highest layer-1 thoughput of all (50k transaction per second!), but is still somewhat centralized (although this is being addressed) and has yet to build a competitive ecosystem.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** it's a tokenized version of Bitcoin so it can be used on the Ethereum network and in DeFi applications.
17. **Polygon (MATIC):** the most popular layer-2 solution for Ethereum, Matic is the official coin of Polygon and used to pay fees on it: many Ethereum applications are moving there but it's still not easy to use with few exchanges supporting it directly.
18. **Ethereum Classic (ETC):** native token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain, a hard fork of Ethereum that claims to be more tied to Ethereum original plan. It has suffered various 51% attacks in the past years.
19. **Stellar (XLM):** created by an ex-Ripple founder, its aim is to become a currency and to allow to trade assets in a cheap and fast way. Last time I joked it was a 40c stablecoin, now I wished that held true.
20. **THETA (THETA):**  The token of THETA, a decentralized video delivery network (in a p2p fashion), used mainly for governance.
21. **DAI (DAI):** the biggest stablecoin not pegged 1-to-1 (or at least not claiming to) to the dollar, but soft-pegged and using cryptocurrencies deposited in smart contracts to collaterize the newly minted tokens.
22. **Internet Computer (ICP):** after its disastrous launch earlier this year, it almost overthrew Dogecoin as the biggest meme in the space. Jokes aside, it's a blockchain aiming to revolutionize the current internet, claiming to run at the same speed as the current web.
23. **VeChain (VET):**  Once everyone's favorite coin in this sub, was hit hard in the May crash and only lately recovering. Vechain is a blockchain focusing on business use-cases and supply chain management, VET (and VTHO) are the blockchain's official coins.
24. **Filecoin (FIL):**  the most popular IPFS (Interplentary File System), a peer-to-peer storage network without having to rely on cloud storage companies.
25. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron's founder Justin Sun is like Jian-Yang, great at repackaging other projects (thanks to u/fbslo on the last post). Jokes aside, it's a blockchain platform for decentralized applications more focused on content sharing and entertainment.
26. **Monero (XMR):**  Monero's goal is  to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it‚Äôs commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person‚Äôs identity, Monero obscures even senders and recipients whereas BTC doesn't. 
27. **Aave (AAVE):** a lending-borrowing decentralized protocol on Ethereum (and Polygon), the AAVE token grants discounted fees on the platform and act as a governance token.
28. **TERRA (LUNA):** Terra is a blockchain protocol offering a variety of applications, from stablecoins to synthetic assets and stocks. LUNA is the native token used to stabilize the price of UST (the TERRA stablecoin) and peg it to the dollar, and can be used to pay fees on the network.
29. **EOS (EOS):** another PoS blockchain launched in 2018, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It is designed to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology. 
30. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the native token of the Crypto.com chain and the Crypto.com exchange. Similar to the BNB token, it is closely tied to the success of the exchange.
31. **AMP (AMP):** it's an Ethereum token and it's used as collateral on the Flexa network, covering any financial transactions that fail if the need arises.
32. **Axie Infinity (AXS):** without a doubt the most popular blockchain game, a mix of Pok√©mon and Tamagotchi that follows the Play-To-Earn model. AXS is the token used for governance and soon staking.
33. **PancakeSwap (CAKE):** the most popular decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain, it started off as a copy of the Uniswap AMM model to then provide a variety of services.
34. **FTX Token (FTT):** the native token of the FTX platform, specialized in trading derivatives. It can be used as collateral or for discounts on trading fees.
35. **Bitcoin BEP2 (BTCB):** another tokenized version of Bitcoin, this time on the Binance Smart Chain.
36. **The Graph (GRT):**  It is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS like Filecoin. Basically simplyfing the retrieval of data on blockchains for developers and applications.
37. **Algorand (ALGO):** founded by the MIT professor Silvio Micali, it's a PoS blockchain supporting smart contracts, with low fees and high throughput of operations.
38. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):**  A utility token related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex. 
39. **Maker (MKR):** Maker is a token on the ethereum blockchain use for governance of the MakerDAO and Maker protocol, the organization behind the DAI stablecoin.
40. **Cosmos (ATOM):** dubbed the ""internet of blockchains"" by its founders, it solves the problem of interoperability between blockchains and provides tools to developers to build their own blockchains. Atom is the coin powering the platform and some notable projects built on top of it are Terra and Crypto.com chain.
41. **SHIBA INU (SHIB):** a meme coin that exploded in May, recently ShibaSwap was launched to give some sort of use-case to the coin which got a 3% score by DeFi Safety (later updated to 35%).
42. **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** a hard fork of a hard fork (BCH), it claims to be the true Satoshi Nakamoto vision of Bitcoin with an even bigger block size. Can't come up with a better joke than last time, I'm sorry.
43. **Tezos (XTZ):** another PoS Ethereum competitor. XTZ is the official coin used for governance and staking. One characteristic is that it is unforkable: it's impossible to create duplicates as instead happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum.
44. **Klaytn (KLAY):** a blockchain using a hybrid design between public and private chains, allowing anyone to create their own chain easily and without any technical knowledge, trying to appeal to companies and institutions mainly.
45. **NEO (NEO):**  *Noone can be told what it is, you'll have to see if for yourself.* Just kidding: launched in early 2014, it's a blockchain not too different from Ethereum where NEO is the coin used for governance. It has a Smart Economy System using digital assets (linked to a physical one) and verificable digital identities on smart contracts. 
46. **IOTA (MIOTA):**  open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things,  it uses a inventive blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same, with zero transactions fees and good scalability.
47. **Compound (COMP):** it's the governance token of Compound, a borrowing and lending platform not too different from Aave, launched in 2018 and with one of the biggest locked value of DeFi applications.
48. **TerraUSD (UST):** it's a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is available in different blockchains and it's getting more and more adoption, rising the price of Luna (which is directly tied to the demand for UST).
49. **Avalanche (AVAX):**  open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange. With an high throughput and good scalability, anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. 
50. **Theta Fuel (TFUEL):** it's another native token of the Theta blockchain, it acts as a gas token to power the operations on the blockchain and is used for payments to relayers (users sharing their computing power).

USDC,cryptocurrency,"The Great Moon Experiment: Finale - November 5th, 2021. 10,000 in Moons - $500 USD - 10 Coins on Binance, Redditors pick the Coins - Prize distribution!","Morning /r/cryptocurrency!

Today marks the finale of the 10,000 moon project.

&#x200B;

1 year ago today, [I made a post where posters here could pick coins](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/joj3q6/the_great_moon_experiment_beginning_today/) and I would hold them for a year - After the year, I would distribute the results to the people who got the 10 highest voted coins.

There's been plenty of ups and downs - The $50 into DOGE last november turned into $15,000 - [Which I asked the user if they wanted to sell and they did - Generously donating $5k to a nonprofit chosen by the community](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n9e8kz/009btc_charity_donation_help_choose_a_nonprofit/).

&#x200B;

Without further adieu, here are the final results (Apologies for the lack of blockfolio graph - Old tablet died):

&#x200B;

**ETH - 0.121 - $544.50**

&#x200B;

ETH has gained almost 11x from last November, not only following Bitcoin on the way up but having its own price discovery - Hitting multiple all time highs and making pretty much every fan of the project happy along the way. A $50 investment has turned into $544.50, and that's definitely better than your local bank!

&#x200B;

**NANO - 70.3 - $407.74**

&#x200B;

You know, it hasn't been the biggest year for NANO - There were some rises and some falls, but it mostly stuck with Bitcoin and did it's own thing. A fairly quiet year for the project led to it mostly staying on the same tracks - But that still ended up with 8x gains from the original investment. Not a bad trade!

&#x200B;

**ADA - 504 - $1,008**

&#x200B;

After a huge breakout year where holders saw 100x gains, ADA has regressed back just a little, but the vast majority of holders of the project must be super happy about where it is. With smart contracts finally released and the project looks pretty solid, ADA has enjoyed a blistering 20x gain from the original $50 input.

&#x200B;

**VET - 4,911 - $775.93**

&#x200B;

VET has had its ups and downs, rising to a huge all time high and then heading back down the ladder, only to find a bit of a resurgence as the year enters its end times. Overall, the project has looked pretty sold, with a 15x return from the start of the project.

&#x200B;

**XRP - 212 - $248.04**

&#x200B;

In a year bogged down with lawsuits and delistings, XRP wasn't the star performer of the crowd like it was in 2017 - It hit lows not seen for years before bouncing back up with Bitcoin and the possibility of a positive result in the lawsuit. Regardless, it still managed 500% returns from the beginning of the year, sitting about roughly even with Bitcoin itself. Could be worse!

&#x200B;

**IOTA - 204 - $277.44**

&#x200B;

Nothing special for the tangle this year either - Roughly moving with Bitcoin almost the entire way and not really having breakthroughs at any point of the year. Still, nothing wrong with that, you could've invested in government bonds instead of having 5x returns.

&#x200B;

**LTO - 734 - $213.81**

&#x200B;

LTO started the challenge off about as strong as could be - Rocketing to new all time highs every day, but has not kept up the rocket fuel needed to stay there. As a result, it's sat around roughly $0.30 since ""the good ol' days"" of the project. As such, 4x returns is all this project managed to hang onto - Which is not great for this project, but damn good overall!

&#x200B;

**SOL - 27 - $6,417.36**

Well, there's nothing more to be said here. SOL's initial $50 investment has ballooned into the current #4 crypto, with expectations sky high.  It's become a community favourite, and no wonder - SOL's returns from the beginning of the project are an almost unbelievable 128x.

&#x200B;

**XMR - 0.453 -117.07**

By far the worst performer of the entire challenge, almost from the start to the finish, XMR has remained one of the least profitable investments in the entire challenge. XMR underperformed Bitcoin, and the vast majority of other cryptos. Still, better than having your money in a bank with 0.05% interest!

&#x200B;

**XLM - 72 - $26.56**

&#x200B;

Ok, to be fair to XLM, this was swapped in the middle of the challenge at almost the top of the May cycle - When DOGE was sold, so it's not an entirely fair look to XLM - It's done relatively well over the year but was bought at almost the most unrealistic level possible. To make it fair, I will swap $25 more to make up a $50 investment for the person who suggested it.

&#x200B;

The last time the portfolio was tracked, it was at **$7608.46** giving us a net gain of of **$2427.99** from October to November.

If the $500 (10,000 moons) had been left in moons, they would currently be worth **$1739.16.**

If the $500 had been left in BTC (0.0353 \* $54,200), it would be worth $**2176.24.**

&#x200B;

It was a fun ride! The portfolio has outperformed pretty much everything, $500 has turned into over $25,000 to be distributed, and I'll ping the winners shortly so they can post their addresses for their christmas presents.

Thanks for playing everyone :)",58,2021-11-05 13:18:38,127
USDC,cryptocurrency,Can someone here pls convince me otherwise‚Ä¶,"Can someone with more knowledge convince me that we‚Äôre not barreling towards the biggest financial crisis in the history of fiat? The more I learn about crypto the more I‚Äôm beginning to see it as a 3+ trillion dollar house of cards that could be rugged at any second. My main concerns are the following:

‚Ä¢Tether‚Äôs claimed ‚Äòassets‚Äô that back their coin 1:1 even though they refuse to be audited, are being delisted by countries and exchanges for not following regulations, Yet they‚Äôre minting billions of dollars worth at their treasury every week. Where are their assets?

‚Ä¢IFinex owning tether and bitfinex. So you mean to tell me they take my dollars, mint new tether which I go buy bitcoin with, then with the dollars I gave them they also buy bitcoin. Am I missing something here? Or are they somehow able to buy two dollars worth of bitcoin with one dollar. Isn‚Äôt this propping up the price of bitcoin?

‚Ä¢Liquidity issues. Especially with recent widespread complaints of Coinbase users not being able to withdraw funds in USD. If there was a run on the exchanges would people be able to cash out? 

‚Ä¢Whale dominance. It‚Äôs no secret that whales control a majority of crypto wallets. If and when they want to cash out they are going to dump on the heads of new retail investors/etf investors and whoever else weren‚Äôt able to sell fast enough once the rug gets pulled.

‚Ä¢U.S. political landscape. It‚Äôs no secret the incoming trump administration wants to pump their bags. Claiming to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. At the same time Trumps Pick for Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick just so happens to be the Cantor Fitzgerald CEO. The ones currently being fined by the SEC for violations. The same Cantor Fitzgerald who is partnering up with Tether to issue them U.S. backed loans. Conflict of interest much? 

‚Ä¢MicroStrategy and other mining companies bitcoin treasury strategy. With MSTR now being added to the QQQ this raises the concerns of what would happen in the event of another 80%+ drawdown in crypto. Their infinite money glitch is reminiscent of mortgage lenders genius ideas of CDO‚Äôs back in 08. I understand the differences but MSTR is relying on their bitcoin continually increasing in price. This method works great until it doesn‚Äôt.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love bitcoin, the concept, the future goals, the technology and security of it. The freedom it gives you from tradfi and central banks. However I can‚Äôt seem to shake the fact that we might be speeding towards one of the greatest financial bubbles/collapses in history of it all fails. Led by an administration of deregulation oligarchs who wants to pump their bags until the national debt reaches 100 trillion plus. I‚Äôm not trying to spread FUD in here and I‚Äôm heavily invested myself but can someone drop their knowledge and ease my mind about these concerns?",338,2024-12-14 08:01:21,313
USDC,cryptocurrency,"Right now, each bitcoin 'produced' by mining generates, on average, around $3,226 in losses to miners","[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FkgJD3QaAAEteb9?format=jpg&name=large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FkgJD3QaAAEteb9?format=jpg&name=large)

Right now, each bitcoin 'produced' by mining generates, on average, around $3,226 in losses to miners:

* Bitcoin Average Mining Costs: $20,095
* BTC/USD: \~$16,869

And the mining net negative has been a reality for a few weeks in a row.

When considering this quick accounting of around $3,226 of losses for each new BTC put into circulation and that every 10 minutes, 6.25 BTC are issued, we are talking about an estimated loss of $120,975/hour.

Draw your own conclusions about this...

This Wednesday (21st), another large mining company demonstrates the difficulties faced in the activity, as Core Scientific filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the USA.

It's not the first, not the second, and probably not the last.

With each new event like this one, the bitcoin network tends towards centralization.  It's scary to think that a network of over $300 billion USD in capitalization has a Nakamoto Coefficient (NC) equal to 2. With 2 entities being responsible for >52% of all hashrate produced.

[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FkgJqzKWQAIkY9c?format=jpg&name=large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FkgJqzKWQAIkY9c?format=jpg&name=large)

This is just one more demonstration, among many others, of how flawed Bitcoin's economic and security model is. Or, as the advocates of the leading currency say: ""this is just another FUD"".

We need to have an open mind to change our minds based on new learnings.

Bitcoin was an excellent idea, which emerged during a major global economic crisis and brought a rare innovation to our monetary and technological system, but technology continued to evolve and the BTC experiment brought us previously unknown answers.

I don't believe bitcoin is the best candidate to continue to bring the innovation we need to decentralized money. Currently, there are already coins that better fulfill some of the functions of bitcoin.

I have my personal favorites, but I don't want this post to be seen as a ""shill post"", so I will keep this opinion to myself for now.

USDC,cryptocurrency,I Tried All the Free Methods of Gaining Crypto and These are the Results,"The title says it all. I downloaded and used all the ‚Äòfree‚Äô ways to earn crypto I read about on the internet and on reddit, so that you don‚Äôt have to. I tried to use them all for at least a month to see what kinds of earnings there were. They are listed in order according to how much I recommend them, from best to worst.

\*FULL DISCLAIMER:\* on most of these sites I used fake names and new emails to register. Some of them may be harvesting your data or providing other security concerns. Please do your own research, be safe, and remember that many apps and websites do not have your best interest in mind.

&#x200B;

\*\*Brave Browser\*\*

What it is: Brave is a free browser to download and use - essentially an alternative to Chrome or Firefox. And as an actual browser, I must say I‚Äôm quite pleased. It‚Äôs fast, simple, and comes with built in adblocker and Tor browser. But we aren‚Äôt here to talk about free browsers. In addition to blocking ads, Brave (if you allow it to) will send you ads of their own, and give you the revenue in crypto. Every fifteen minutes or so while browsing the net, a little popup text box appears in the bottom right of my screen, advertising a product. I close it out, and a few pennies are added to my account. Brave pays out in the form of BAT tokens. It was easy to setup - simpler if you have an uphold account - and I found the ads to be unobtrusive.

Results: I‚Äôve had Brave for more than a year now and in that time have accumulated 58 BAT, currently worth $46 CAD. Considering that a) I like this browser more than Chrome and b) I have now completely forgotten about the ads and click them away unconsciously, I think this is great. It also helps that BAT has risen so significantly in the last year, and if its a coin you see promise in, I can‚Äôt recommend this enough.

Verdict for Brave: Excellent. Highly Recommended.

&#x200B;

\*\*Presearch\*\*

What it is: It‚Äôs a search engine. You can use it instead of google. Just like google, there are ads - sites paying to be listed first - but unlike google, they pay you a portion of the revenue. If you‚Äôve ever used Bing‚Äôs reward program, its very similar but in crypto rather than fiat. I set it as the search engine in browser bar, and as someone who googles things regularly (me bid dumb ape) I was quickly gaining coins. As a search engine I would say it is ‚Äòokay.‚Äô Though it is designed so you can easily switch to looking at your results in google.

Results: You gain .12 tokens per search (up to 30 per day) and can withdraw after gaining 1,000 tokens. Obviously, how much you make will depend on how often you search things. Personally, I set this as my default search engine and forgot all about it. Do your own research, but I see no downsides.

Verdict for Presearch: Good. Recommended.

&#x200B;

\*\*Honey Miner\*\*

What it is: It‚Äôs a crypto miner that assesses your computers capabilities, and runs accordingly (or so it claims). I have a MacBook Pro, so certainly no mining rig. No GPUs, really nothing that could help me do actual crypto mining. So I set up Honeyminer, and it mines in the background with the resources that are available.

Results: My MacBook got hot and got hot fast. I left it overnight a few times, but honestly, I was concerned about the heat, so I googled it. Sure enough, this is a common issue, and from what I read online, it‚Äôs a bad idea to let it run for too long unless you have a third-party cooling unit. This meant that I was left running it for short spurts during the day, which was far less effective. If you have a gaming computer or proper cooling system, this might work well for you. Otherwise, I‚Äôm not so sure.

After a month I stopped using it for fear of damaging my computer. In the month that I did use it (as I said, on and off) I made 1200 Satoshi, currently worth about $0.40 USD. But honestly a) I didn‚Äôt run it near as much as I could and b) it runs in the background, meaning virtually no time and effort after installation. If you are able to run this without damaging your hardware, why not? As always, do your own research, but this seems okay to me.

Verdict for Honeyminer: Could be good if you have the right computer

&#x200B;

\*\*COIN geominer\*\*

What it is: A phone app that (claims to) scrape geodata and turn it into reward points that can be redeemed for crpyto. I‚Äôm essentially a blue blip on a map of my city, and as I move around, the square area I‚Äôm on is ‚Äúmined‚Äù and turns blue. The more squares you mine, the more coins you get, and you can re-mine a square after a few minutes. Just think of it as a far simpler version of Pokemon go. I usually go for a walk each day, so I brought it with me and mined all the trails and parks in the area. I‚Äôd boot up the app, stick it in my hoodie pocket (can‚Äôt lock the screen) and a half hour walk would drain about half my battery. You can also fill out surveys and watch videos to earn coins, but this sort of defeats the idea of being ‚Äúfree,‚Äù since this actually requires time.

Results: In 3 months I have made 4,000 in-app coins. 10,000 coins can be redeemed for XYO Erc-20 tokens. 1.8 million coins can be redeemed for 0.025 Bitcoin and 5.4 million can be redeemed for one ETH. The quickest way to gain coins is not to use the geominer at all, but to fill out surveys. Back in a different lifetime I used to fill out surveys for a local company and got paid by cheque (in fiat obviously) and I‚Äôd say the prices are similar. Currently I walk with the app, let it drain my battery, check in for bonuses everyday and it will take about 9 months to earn some XYO coins which really don‚Äôt seem worth it. To earn BTC will require about ten years. I‚Äôd say stick with the surveys. The pay isn‚Äôt good, but its comparable to other places that pay you to do surveys.

Verdict for COIN: Skip the geomining feature. If you‚Äôre willing to write surveys, they will pay you in crypto.

&#x200B;

\*\*Stormgain Express\*\*

What it is: It claims to be a Bitcoin miner for your phone, but it most certainly is not. Basically every four hours you log onto the app, hit the ‚Äúbitcoin miner‚Äù button and it will start spitting out some numbers that look like crypto wallet addresses. Each time you mine it will give you a little bit of money. According to the app and the website, it sincerely claims this is bitcoin mining. However, if you know anything (and I mean ANYTHING) about bitcoin mining, this has to be a straight up lie. Mining on my phone (and a crappy one at that)? It works even when I turn off my wifi and data? And my phone doesn‚Äôt even overheat? I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on here, but they claim its bitcoin mining. Anyways, I tried to reactivate this every four hours. I‚Äôm going to say I ran it an average of three times a day for two months.

Stormgain express is also just a good old fashioned crypto exchange. You can put in money and trade. So bear that in mind - some people may want to use this as their primary trading app, and let the miner add a few pennies along the way. In fact, it claims it will mine faster if you deposit money. You can do this at your own risk - I never did, and can‚Äôt vouch for the security of the app. I only ever used the free miner, and added no money of my own.

Results: You can withdraw your money after you make $10 USDT, which took me about a month. Honestly, not bad for an I-don‚Äôt-know-what-you‚Äôre-actually-doing-app. Once you‚Äôve withdrawn the money, you can turn them into put calls on a crypto of your choice. I used the app for a second month and only made $2. So I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs an incentive to get you in for the first month, and then productivity seemed to plummet. I should also add that there are incentives for getting your friends to download and mine with you.

Verdict for Stormgain: It‚Äôs good for the first month.

&#x200B;

\*\*Pi\*\*

What it is: An app where you log in everyday and click a button to ‚Äòmine digital currency.‚Äô You can do this once every 24 hours. Pi claims to be a crypto coin that will be ‚Äòlaunching soon.‚Äô In other words, I‚Äôm getting paid in a coin that hasn‚Äôt dropped yet.

Results: If Pi is a real coin that drops someday and becomes valuable, that‚Äôs great, I‚Äôve got lots. But I‚Äôm doubtful. I‚Äôm not sure what harm there is to ‚Äúmining‚Äù every day, but the whole thing feels shady. The app claims that once the coin drops you won‚Äôt be able to mine anymore so now is the time to do so. I‚Äôm not convinced Pi will ever materialize.

For now, I‚Äôve mined every day for almost 3 months and have made 136 pi. How much is this worth you ask? Nothing. Nada. Zilch. If you believe the developers are really developing something, go for it, I guess. I see no harm in this app (do your own research) I just don‚Äôt see any benefit.

Verdict for Pi: Not worth it.

&#x200B;

\*\*Cointiply\*\*

What it is: It‚Äôs both an app and a website that offers free Bitcoin hourly. All you have to do is log in and fill out a captcha and you are rewarded. I tried to check back in hourly for a month. I‚Äôm going to say I averaged 5-6 times per day.

Results: After one month I have made 2,483 in-app coins, worth .00000762 BTC, or $0.25 USD. The minimal withdrawal amount is 50,000 coins (30,000 if you withdraw to DOGE). At this rate it will take me 20 months to make a withdrawal. In that time I will have earned approximately $5 USD, which will then be converted into whatever the price of BTC is at that time. That is, if this site actually pays out and isn‚Äôt a scam. Anyone willing to wait 20 months to find out?

Verdict for Cointiply: Not Worth it

&#x200B;

\*\*Free Cypto/Faucet Apps\*\*

What it is: There‚Äôs a bunch of these apps (I have an android but I assume iPhones are the same) that claim to offer free crypto and/or to be faucets. I downloaded several and they are all essentially the same. I ended up using one called ‚ÄòFree Litecoin‚Äô for a month to see how it went. Every hour you can log in and hot a button that spins and decides if you won free coins or not. I played an average of 5-6 times per day for a month and would say I usually won once per day. You can watch ads to earn additional spins, which, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, increased my chances of winning. As far as I can tell, all of these apps (and there are many of them) are essentially the same. It‚Äôs a randomized game that may or may not pay out every hour.

Results: ‚ÄòFree Litecoin‚Äô pays in Litoshi (the smallest unit of Litecoin). After one month I have made 14,855 Litoshi. You need 100,000 to withdraw. Bear in mind there are 100 million Litoshi on a litecoin. This means that at current trading value, I make approximately 29 cents Canadian each month in this app. It will take me more than 6 months to make a withdrawal, worth about $1.70 CAD. That is, assuming you actually can withdraw and this isn‚Äôt just a scam.

Verdict for Free Crypto Apps: Not Worth It


EDIT: A lot of people asking why I didn't include either fill-surveys-for-crypto or pay-to-earn games on your phone. Quite simply because if something requires my time I didn't count it as ""free.""

&#x200B;

Hi everyone, MrNuttyJoe back again with another top-quality post. As many of you may know, Family Guy referenced Bitcoin back in early-2016. This report will analyse how Peter and the Griffin Family could have become rich through the purchase and Hodling of Bitcoin had they invested at that point in time.

&#x200B;

\*\*\* **Part 1: Overview \*\*\***

Family Guy - Season 14, Episode 11: *The Peanut Butter Kid*

Original Airdate: January 10, 2016 (Rotten Tomatoes 2021)

&#x200B;

The Griffin family is struggling financially, and understands that some tight budgeting decisions need to be made. At exactly 01:17 into the episode, Peter announces his brilliant plan to help pull the Griffins out of the hell that is a low-middle income wage.

The transcript is as follows‚Ä¶.

&#x200B;

*Lois Griffin:*  `Peter, every month our savings get smaller and smaller. We really gotta (sic) figure out a better way to budget for this family‚Äôs future!`

*Peter Griffin:*  `‚Ä¶Bitcoin!`

*Lois Griffin:*  `What?`

*Peter Griffin:*  `I don‚Äôt know.`

&#x200B;

[Image 1: A shot of the now-famous scene. Please note Peter's hesitation and pure nervousness.... now THIS is what acting is all about. Powerful!](https://preview.redd.it/6j3ggqouppe71.png?width=289&format=png&auto=webp&s=6612ce990bd9b1e81d20db86f9c02b70e6c456d4)

&#x200B;

As you can see, the idea to invest in Bitcoin is very quickly dismissed. But what if the Griffins *had* decided to make that bold leap into the world of CryptoCurrency?

&#x200B;

\*\*\* **Part 2: Market Snapshot (as of January 10, 2016) \*\*\***

Figure 1 presents an idea of where Bitcoin was in terms of value (in USD) at the start of 2016.

&#x200B;

[Figure 1. From an ATH of $1 150 \(approx\) in 2014, BTC was hovering around $450 at the time the Family Guy episode aired in early 2016.](https://preview.redd.it/5c6wo63zrpe71.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c7f60593eebedf0cae71d771554fa7c73fde43a)

&#x200B;

As you can see, Bitcoin was priced at approximately $450 USD as of January 10, 2016! This is the price at which Peter Griffin would theoretically have bought in.

Comparing this to Bitcoin‚Äôs All Time High achieved in April 2021 (Figure 2):

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Figure 2. BTC price from the original airdate to April's ATH.](https://preview.redd.it/v9dczap3tpe71.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdff6ee7eae4235d0f1e41a783c3265cb86b2e04)

A price increase from $450 to $64 800 = a ROI (Return on Investment) of approximately *14 300 %.*

The following image indicates the writer‚Äôs reaction to such an ROI:

&#x200B;

[Image 2  \(Reference: WhatEmoji 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/2mfa9r7etpe71.png?width=308&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b20376148cf7766e6e6cc90b4ef29dc421e413d)

&#x200B;

\*\*\* **Part 3: How much could the Griffins‚Äô Realistically Invest? \*\*\***

Calculating the size of the investment Peter and co. could put into Bitcoin will prove challenging, given we must make assumptions into the family‚Äôs finances. We will apply the following rules:

1. Only *discretionary income purchases* can be considered. We will reallocate all expenses from non-necessities purchased by the Griffins in Episodes 11-13 (around 1 month‚Äôs worth) and put them into Bitcoin; this will *not* include bills, transportation costs, etc., as these costs should ALWAYS come before investing (looking at you FOMOers).
2. No hand-outs. As you other die-hard Family Guy fans will know, certain secondary characters such as Lois‚Äô parents and Quagmire are reasonably-well off (or just stinking rich). We will assume that Peter does *not* ask anyone for financial help to buy Bitcoin, rather relying on his own discretionary income.

Below are the following discretionary income purchases made by the Griffins within one month of Season 14, Episode 11:

&#x200B;

*Episode 11:*

¬∑ 1 Cheap Metal Detector (approximate price): $200

¬∑ Royalty Check ‚Äì Stewie‚Äôs Commercial: $2 000

¬∑ A tiny, tiny amount of cocaine: $300 for a gram

¬∑ Voice-activated 3D printer: Ignored, as this was purchased using Stewie‚Äôs Royalty Check (counting this would include the Check twice)

&#x200B;

*Episode 12:*

¬∑ MLB (Baseball) Ticket + Hot Dog/Beer/Peanuts: $80 approximately

¬∑ 8-10 Build-A-Bears: $150 approximately

¬∑ 2 x Movie Tickets (based on the average ticket price in U.S., 2016 (Stoll 2021) ): $18 (rounded up)

¬∑ Purple High-Tops: $180 approximately

&#x200B;

*Episode 13:*

¬∑ Quahog Racket Club Membership (Upscale club in Rhode Island, month-long): $1 500

¬∑ Bear-BnB (Bear-themed Air-BnB; 2 nights): $400

¬∑ Flights/Vacation in Hawaii (two adults, cheap accommodation): $5 200 (BudgetYourTrip 2021)

¬∑ Chemical Castration Cost (1 month‚Äôs cost): $1 000 (North 2019)

&#x200B;

# Total Discretionary Income: $11 028.

This is the amount available for Peter Griffin to invest into Bitcoin.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*\* **Part 4: Conclusion \*\*\***

At a price of $450 per Bitcoin, an investment of $11 028 would give the Griffins 24.5 Bitcoins (rounded down in consideration of fees).

At Bitcoin‚Äôs ATH price on April 14, 2021, this investment would be worth‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

# $1.589 MILLION!

# 

Peter Griffin and family would have become Crypto Millionaires had Peter made the decision to invest back on that fateful day in early January of 2016.

Thank you for reading my post. As I always say‚Ä¶.

USDC,cryptocurrency,"TIL that Ruja Ignatova, after founding a huge fake crypto Ponzi scheme called OneCoin that defrauded investors of $4 billion, disappeared in 2017 ahead of a US warrant for her arrest. As of last year she has been on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. Many consider her the world's most wanted woman.","After reading many articles and Wikipedia pages, this is my best attempt at a summary of the whole story:

Bulgarian Ruja Ignatova spent over a year in prison in 2012 for a fraudulent scheme she ran with her father, and then went on to run an MLM scam in 2013 called BigCoin, before finally founding OneCoin in 2014.

OneCoin was a classical Ponzi scheme in that it paid out old investors with the money of new investors. There was no actual blockchain behind OneCoin, but they pretended there was by simulating transactions in a sham database and claiming there were miners validating transactions when there were not.

Suspicions grew around the world from 2015 onward, eventually leading to investigations and arrests in several countries. In October 2017, Ignatova disappeared after seemingly being tipped off about her impending arrest. She left her brother Konstantin at the helm when she fled, and he was arrested in 2019 and is facing a maximum of 90 years. In China alone 98 people were arrested and prosecuted, with over a quarter billion dollars being recovered.

When the scam fell apart in 2017, it is believed they had stolen around $4 billion USD from investors worldwide. The Times described it as ""one of the biggest scams in history"". Estimates of how much Ruja herself made off with range from half a billion up to the majority of the full $4 billion.

Bulgarian investigative reporters have claimed she was murdered and dismembered in 2018 aboard a yacht and thrown into the Ionian Sea by a Bulgarian drug lord who was apparently trying to cover up his own involvement in the OneCoin scam. However, the FBI are apparently still operating under the assumption that Ruja is alive.

In the summer of 2022, she was put on both Europe's Most Wanted list and the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. She is also the subject of an Interpol warrant. The FBI are offering $250,000 for information leading to her arrest.

In January of this year, a property in London went up for sale under her name, leading to speculation that she is still alive. Some investigators have pointed out that if she is, she has probably had plastic surgery.

Ruja was the subject of a 2019 BBC podcast call *The Missing Cryptoqueen*, as well as a 2022 book of the same name.

Here's how the $500 is now.

&#x200B;

**10 - XMR - $119.12**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[The Gains are still private, at least.](https://preview.redd.it/ew3y0jxrrcr61.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=34d87dd8f9c042bcba944a16fbd94f97213223ae)

&#x200B;

In what seems to be a ritual by now, XMR lags behind the pack. Whether it's regulation or something else, XMR's price has lagged behind in every metric, from Bitcoin to alts. Still better than fiat though!

&#x200B;

**9 - XRP - $148.34**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Signs of a heartbeat.](https://preview.redd.it/voy6hr75scr61.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=90eda9b7b957e601593e5b94163793841d3c4886)

Still lagging behind the pack, it looks like the former #2 of the Crypto world has begun to pick up a bit of its slack. Time will tell if this is just following in Bitcoin's footsteps, or if the SEC trial continues to pull at its pricing.

&#x200B;

**8 - ETH - $249.75**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Steady and solid, but largely moving with BTC.](https://preview.redd.it/flmcl8kiscr61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=b08f23306103d725a69100d184270ef8327f0026)

In a normal challenge, going 5x your original amount would be crazy and cause for celebration. However, in terms of this one, ETH is actually lagging behind the rest of altcoins. Still, a $2000+ celebration is in order for all the ETH holders, which is a major price milestone. High gas fees continue into 2021 however, so maybe people are skeptical about scaling issues and the time it will take to resolve them.

&#x200B;

**7 - IOTA - $360.19**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Getting untangled at last.](https://preview.redd.it/d3wm9wmxscr61.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=09eafaa6b4f518f0286feb55c13f7e8b7d791fbd)

IOTA seems to have picked up signs of life in the last month, rocketing to two new spikes that remind holders of the 2017 days. It's no all time high again (Yet), but surely this should give people enthusiastic about the project good vibes.

&#x200B;

**6 - NANO - $371.12**

&#x200B;

[A little issue with proof of work.](https://preview.redd.it/ae4kv4hctcr61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac25cde34444b956b8a7d9ebdf2de6123883f563)

NANO looked to be rising to get near its former glory when a spam attack hit the network, bottlenecking transactions and halting exchange activity. Its price has regressed in the meantime. Still, an impressive run since November can't leave people interested in the project too sour, and an update was quickly pushed to mitigate damage, so maybe it will do better in next month's challenge.

&#x200B;

**5 - VET - $483.76**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[An all time high once again.](https://preview.redd.it/afqk16o2ucr61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=845c61b20c27e3b0f1ed294ade5c0319d4939f97)

&#x200B;

VET has pierced the $0.10 mark, marking this as the first time since 2018 it has crested a new all time high. It enters price discovery mode now, so enthusiasts are excited to watch where it leads from here. 

&#x200B;

**4 - LTO - $592.99**

&#x200B;

LTO has seemingly become a /r/cryptocurrency fan favourite since November, hitting all time highs seemingly every month. It seems to hit a new all time high every week, retracing gains since then, but still remains in the top 300. Is more to come for LTO or was this a flash in the pan?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

ADA started the month with a rocket past $1, smashing all time highs, then hit another blistering milestone, climbing almost to $1.50. It's since regressed slightly as people take profits and consolidation happens, but ADA's prowess is more than noticeable since challenge start.

&#x200B;

**2 - SOL - $635.74**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

SOL has been a surprise performer, absolutely smashing not 1, not 2, but 4 all time highs in this month alone. In November, there was some FUD about the supply increasing and the market cap being bloated, but it's still remained a shooting star since then.

&#x200B;

**1 - DOGE - $1137.88**

&#x200B;

DOGE continues to be the frontrunner, with spikes and dips based on Elon Musk's current sentiment and twitter posts. Still, DOGE is up so much from the start of this challenge it's looking questionable if any other coin will go anywhere near its heights.

USDC,cryptocurrency,"""I calculated how much a coin would be worth from a 1K investment now if it ever reaches back to its all time high."" BAD IDEA!","I know this sub can be passionate about alt-coin projects. Please read and consider before commenting or downvoting.

This is a response to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vrcb1h/i_calculated_how_much_a_coin_would_be_worth_from/) that got a lot of attention recently.

I get it. Alt-coins are enticing. But the above post is very dangerous. People who read the above post seem to erroneously assume that all of those alt coins will eventually come back to its ATH. Because crypto always comes back, right? This leads readers to conclude that they should put money in the alt-coin that has fallen the most percentage-wise for the highest gains when the ATH comes back. This is NOT analysis. This is a fun, fantastical thought experiment. None of this logic is based in reality, I'll do my best to explain.

Let me start with this statement that should be the whole takeaway of this post: \***NO MAINSTREAM ALT-COIN HAS EVER ACHIEVED ATH AGAINST BITCOIN IN TWO CONSECUTIVE CYCLES.** (\*The only exception I know of is Dogecoin, and only because Elon pumped it. Hardly a sustainable model or basis for investment. So it'll be ignored for this post.)

What this means is, every dollar you invest in crypto will be better going to Bitcoin than any other coin. I know a lot of people love their alt-coin projects that they are passionate about. I love crypto and want to see it succeed. But please look at the price history of alt-coins. They all fail against bitcoin in the long run. I'm not trying to crap on any alt-coin project you are passionate about, it very well *may* succeed and be the next bitcoin. All I'm saying is let's look at how well this bet has performed in the past.

Pretty much every alt-coin price history looks something like this:

https://preview.redd.it/2p967fpnija91.png?width=1890&format=png&auto=webp&s=02d96d6103f84cf9cae4abfb4670e91b8156fea1

Here's FTM. A decent project that was promoted by many. Such is the alt-coin life cycle. There's a price discovery in a bull run, temporary euphoria (this is where most of us buy in, near the ATH), and then death. Doesn't recover from that. Go look for yourself! Look up any alt-coin price history and it'll look pretty much like this. It would have been better to put that money in Bitcoin.

But what if we just weather the bear market? Just like the above post in question, what if we buy more when it's low and get XXX% return when it hits the ATH again! It's a bigger return than even Bitcoin returning to its ATH! People I know did this same ""what if it went back to ATH?"" experiment back in 2019. We all put a decent amount of money into NANO, because we would 30x our money! Well, look what happened:

https://preview.redd.it/7qcwew1pija91.png?width=1888&format=png&auto=webp&s=002daf610a4a3bfdb4112f4398111fdb7e795c8c

Didn't get close to its ATH. It would have been better to put that money in Bitcoin.

But what about coins where it DOES hit another ATH? Some coins will do that, here's ADA for example:

https://preview.redd.it/e4k2odbqija91.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=65ae3ba3c25bc1e76588c45f2a1cb4f533b45142

It shattered it's ATH! What a great one to hold! Actually, no. Look at it's price against Bitcoin:

https://preview.redd.it/5by4lhuqija91.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbebc656e9d64c18272326826a40649c294fc6db

Even ADA, the ""ETH-Killer"" didn't reach another ATH against bitcoin. It would have been better to put that money in Bitcoin.

And here's ETH:

https://preview.redd.it/mb7hfvq8yja91.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=e62eb3387c24a0b8ce83bff3bccce66ea46314d1

Yes, ETH, like some alt-coins, retouched it's USD ATH. But not against Bitcoin.

For any dollar you put into a crypto that's NOT bitcoin, you are making one of the worst bets in history. Far worse than casino odds. You are literally betting for something to happen that has pretty much never happened before. Yet people still put money in alt-coins! Even the ""smart money"" does. A 2019 study by Deloitte found that a simple buy and hold strategy of bitcoin outperformed every single crypto hedge fund. Embarrassing.

Another AWFUL bet is anything in the top 10! Every coin that entered the top 10 has lost value against BTC from then on. And when one leaves the top 10, it has never returned. (Again, except DOGE). If you own a coin in the top 10, or worse, continue owning it after it leaves the top 10, you are making one of the worst bets in history! It doesn't matter how passionate you are about the community, or how much you just know/believe that the coin will be the next big thing. History shows you are most definitely wrong in this bet. Should put the money in Bitcoin.

One case for alt-coins that lots of people make is the bitcoin dominance chart. Guy from Coin bureau likes to point this one out a lot. According to him, it has been ""dropping like a rock"" since 2017:

https://preview.redd.it/rw8wnptrija91.png?width=2714&format=png&auto=webp&s=e68b17a33b1b1a6c8341aac05cd7f3a2ee025d51

So the future is alt-coins right? Bitcoin is clearly losing market share to alts, right? Actually, this metric tells the opposite. Consider the sheer number of coins now in existence, along with the insane growth of stablecoins. If all components of this metric remained constant over the past several years, then I would agree that the future seems to be alt-coins. However, in 2017 there were less than 1000 cryptocurrencies. Now there are over 20,000! And value in stablecoins has exploded. So now, there are 20x more alt-coins and over 100 billions dollars of stablecoins in the denominator of this metric competing for marketshare against bitcoin. To have all that be added to the denominator and BTC dominance still be so high is remarkable, and only proves that it will continue to be the most valuable chain for the foreseeable future. History shows any bet against bitcoin has been a bad one.

Lastly, if you simply MUST invest in an alt-coin for whatever reason, here's my advice on how to do it.

&#x200B;

1. Ignore any alt-coins that have already made the upside-down V pattern in the first visual. If that's already happened anywhere in its price history, then ignore it.
2. Find a new alt-coin that has a sideways price pattern and was created during the current crypto winter.
3. Its value proposition must be something that hasn't had a bubble yet. No BTC forks/clones. No NFTs or platform tokens. No DeFi or DEX coins. Something new, like maybe soul-bound tokens for this next rally? (Not a soul-bound token itself, because that can't be sold, but a token for its infrastructure)
4. Sell it somewhere in the next bull run. Don't get too greedy, take the profits and put them in Bitcoin.

I do not consider myself to be a Bitcoin Maxi. Too many people lose money in alt-coin projects. Too many newbies buy an alt-coin as their first coin. Yes, there is money to be made in alt-coins, but mostly by getting in and out at the right time, not through a buy and hold which is 1000x easier. Yes, there's money to be made in some alts, but by and large it's better for the money to be put in Bitcoin. If someone has more info to prove me wrong or teach me something, please do. But unless you can, please learn from the price history of alt-coins. Buy bitcoin, put it in cold storage, and wait. History \*so far\* has shown that to be the best thing.

tl;dr Price history of alt-coins against Bitcoin proves that holding alt-coins are always a bad investment.",1640,2022-07-09 13:04:46,641

[Wild rides up and down the line.](https://preview.redd.it/phuh3k0p4of61.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=f447b2aa22b81da7806c9680bd7237a0cfafd193)

&#x200B;

XRP has been a rollercoaster, starting the month weak with the SEC Lawsuit rumbling and staying dormant most of the month. A coordinated Pump scheme pushed it back near its stratospheric levels of a few months ago before falling back down into the depths.

&#x200B;

\#8: IOTA - $100.88

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Choppy waters ahead on the tangle.](https://preview.redd.it/47dd95275of61.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd1f6a42f848ac17c1f5a7bd40402a7a0d0be1b7)

IOTA has been largely trading in the same $0.10 range for most of January but looks to be finally breaking out of its rut. The chart's looked like this before though, so time will tell if it's an actual breakout or if it will retrace to where it's been for most of the challenge.

&#x200B;

\#7: VET - $148.90

&#x200B;

[Peaks and Valleys.](https://preview.redd.it/ut7ydt9k5of61.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac8bd01550914f462a3f980f2ac06843f90b804c)

&#x200B;

What once was a forerunner of the challenge has been largely stagnant over the last month, peaking to an all time high (After token split) but then retracing. Momentum seems to be slowly catching up with the hot market, so maybe we'll see VET pick up steam again in February.

&#x200B;

\#6: LTO - $182.56

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[All time highs & retraces.](https://preview.redd.it/qc89h3bx5of61.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=889c69b68abe78ab4928dcf4322d9bfc2dcbcbe2)

&#x200B;

On a similar chart to VET, LTO actually hit its all time high on January 19th, then fell back down to earth a little bit as people realized their profits. Looks to be on the trajectory to reclaim it in February.

&#x200B;

\#5: SOL - $183.56

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Crikey, that's a beauty.](https://preview.redd.it/1oln5gi96of61.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=f37162979b6535342d503c05f730ab105d1720e8)

&#x200B;

In what can only be described as a fantastic month for newcomer Solana, it's absolutely smashed all time highs for the entire month and doesn't seem to have an end in sight. What was once a laggard in the challenge seems to be pushing for a frontrunning spot in the next couple of months. Volume is steady and price is rocking.

&#x200B;

\#4: ETH - $207.86

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[ETH Fans and Miners together rejoice!](https://preview.redd.it/mc1jseap6of61.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=f82f79fdcd6546359c2e3a3bbcce905f975b18f9)

&#x200B;

Speaking of rocking graphs, the #2 Crypto isn't any slouch either. ETH has smashed its all time high and looks to be on top of the world as its quadrupled in value since the start of this challenge. With DEFI exploding and gas fees off the charts, hopefully this gives ETH the momentum to start moving into the highly anticipated 2.0.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\#3: ADA - $253.51

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Doubling in price in a month? Not bad!](https://preview.redd.it/0i51dxi17of61.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=c13d67514fb810033ec8d0c5dd529b41698a04e2)

Cardano is no slouch this month either, starting to pick up a lot of the momentum it had from the 2017 bull run. It's nowhere near the all time highs it had yet but if it keeps on the firey track its taken, it seems inevitable that it's not too far away. Since the challenge's inception, ADA has quintupled its total value.

&#x200B;

\#2: NANO - $255.04

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Now that's what you call explosive.](https://preview.redd.it/rweh7gzf7of61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=164995b3f2cffb569ae51b6d637228b34b8b10aa)

Not to be outdone, NANO almost tripled in value from the very start of the month on face ripping volume. It retraced down to half that value, then has been chopping in the same area for a while. It's held most of its gains on the way down and is trading at an amazing 5x its original value in just a few short months.

&#x200B;

\#1: DOGE - $900.33

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Such growth, much natural.](https://preview.redd.it/nqtm1dht7of61.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b58e28f6a1728866c9a72c231930b997396bdad)

Alright Elon, calm down. DOGE went from its bizarre spike last month to an EVEN MORE bizarre spike this month, fueled by WSB insanity. Our friendly Shibe coin was blowing up the blockfolio, with the $50 invested at the beginning being worth **over $1600 at one point**. Since then, DOGE has held its gains surprisingly well for some reason and is worth its current absurd amount. 

&#x200B;

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

&#x200B;

Overall, the $500 portfolio has risen a blistering $**1367.06** in a month, ending the month at almost 5x **total portfolio value** to end at $2396.36.

If the $500 (10,000 moons) had been left in moons, they would currently be worth $**1,200.**

 If the $500 had been left in BTC (0.0353 \* $38,128), it would be worth $**1,345.91**

&#x200B;

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

&#x200B;

Reddit's portfolio has not only outperformed but almost doubled the gains of both Bitcoin AND Moons this month. Granted, this is largely with the help of whatever the heck DOGE is doing, but even without those gains it would've beaten both of them soundly.

USDC,cryptocurrency,"Hey Redditors! I'm sending some VINU to every commenter, up to a total of 500B VINU (~$12,000)","&#x200B;

As the title says, I'm giving away a bunch of VINU to everyone who comments on this thread! **As well, we will giveaway 5x100$ prizes!**

**What is VINU?**

**Vita Inu (VINU) is the world's first zero-fee, light-speed, dog coin with smart contracts!**

It is a token built on the Vite network in November 2021 by Vite enthusiasts. Much like Nano (XNO), Vite is a DAG network with near-instant transaction times and zero fees. But in addition to that, Vite is the first public chain to implement smart contracts on the basis of a DAG ledger. Because of this, VINU is the world's first dog coin with near-instant transaction times, zero fees, and smart contracts! VINU is also proudly the #1 project on the Vite chain.

VINU's philosophy is to provide education about cryptocurrencies in a fun and ethical way. It does so by building a fun and engaging community around the cryptocurrency project. It is also currently sponsoring a[ blockchain awareness program in India](https://twitter.com/i_fly_high_/status/1507916290706456577) (and previously[ Nepal](https://twitter.com/VitaInuCoin/status/1469982262066176005)), and will continue to do more for blockchain awareness elsewhere on the globe.

VINU is unlike other memecoins. First, VINU is committed to paying all its community members fairly for their contributions to the project. Members receive VINU as rewards for moderating social media and community platforms, organising events, creating artwork, and so on. Second, VINU leans into transparency in legal compliance, with legal opinions valid in the EU and US. Last but not least, VINU is committed to the fair distribution of a significant portion of its total supply.

VINU even has its own **tipbot** right here on Reddit, where our community can tip tokens without transaction fees & you‚Äôll see it in action in the comments and over at our subreddit!

Here‚Äôs some of VINU‚Äôs achievements in the past five months since its creation:

USDC,cryptocurrency,Reminder: you guys don't need to pay 2500 USD to get access to some VIP mailing list where a guy tells you to buy 5 small cap coins.,"Title.               

A family member recently attended a webinar where he said that some guy was charging 2500 bucks to get ""insider information"" on what 5 new alt coins are going to go ""sky high"".                

The problem with a business model like this is the guy running this kind of webinar that he does is he makes buttloads of money because 1) he bought all five of those coins in advance and 2) he's charging you 2500 USD for glorified and probably greatly misleading financial advice, oh and point number 3) He's going to dump his bags on you eventually.              

Eventually some youtuber will leak the coins that he bought. Aside from that, I strongly feel as though the only people who should be paying for that information are either ""accredited investors"" or ""borderline accredited investors"" who wouldn't be phased by a 2500 USD buy-in.

This technology is evolving fast, and here is a topical quote:

Bitcoin is all it took to start the new era for new technology, that's how DeFi was created in the aftermath,  leveraging the network.
 Then there was NFT's, Decentralized gaming, lending, banking services and new road for innovation.

Here is the $500 investment now.

&#x200B;

We'll go from the top down this time:

&#x200B;

**ETH: - $473.70**

[Movin on up!](https://preview.redd.it/zulvovcdt0m71.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec91c715bc596413009aed1b5f49fc77e25ad238)

ETH has looked especially strong this month, *almost* briefly touching 4k with Bitcoin not touching its all time high yet. Still, with Crypto looking to burn some jet fuel lately, I think we'll probably see another ETH ATH sooner rather than later.

&#x200B;

**NANO: - $523.75**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Little boring, but up is up. ](https://preview.redd.it/ug397va3u0m71.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c83f22e825c5f76fd7e0c5d954c50537802061e)

Moving largely with the market, NANO doesn't seem to have anything really special to report over the summer months, but its graph does look pretty decent lately. Having done over 10x from its November start, I don't think that's really anything to complain about.

&#x200B;

**ADA - $1,413.80**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Now that's a bull flag!](https://preview.redd.it/kd86y93ju0m71.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=18a45e545a56d75b0c560914ac6db6e20f7b49db)

Skyrocketing to a new all time high over the last month, ADA fans are ecstatic about the oncoming launch of smart contracts on the platform, along with what is almost certainly an all time high in sentiment for the platform. I remember the launch of ADA back in 2017 when it was $0.02, how time flies.

&#x200B;

**VET: $736.29**

&#x200B;

[Rollercoaster of ups and downs, but up in the end.](https://preview.redd.it/ps5ptkjbv0m71.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f861cdd44d4881810471baa8a8173e1e6e80041)

Seesawing somewhat with the market, VET ended the month almost double what it started, despite having multiple stops and starts along the way.  Looking strong heading into a stronger market might make the VET fans hopeful to see a retesting of the all time high just a few short months ago.

&#x200B;

**XRP - $289.94**

&#x200B;

[Riding the wave!](https://preview.redd.it/ljcwlks0w0m71.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd00c2b4f26254b6d1efe14f6ee6f72d114e0a5e)

XRP continues to recover from the SEC slapdown it received, rising to levels it hadn't seen since Bitcoin topped out back in March.  Not close to retesting its all time fervor high just yet, but if the SEC case goes their way and a Bitcoin rise syncs up with it, XRP fans might be partying sooner than they think.

&#x200B;

**IOTA - $371.70**

&#x200B;

[IOTA has arisen from its deep sleep to immense volume once more.](https://preview.redd.it/0ab1heqpw0m71.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a05890ba0c44b0f07745b5d49f4637d44a71516)

A little sleepy for the last few months, IOTA appears to have gotten a bit coordinated and it's volume has gone sky high in the last week or so. With no project specific news, not exactly sure what the price and volume increase is coming from or relating to, but the project is very close to levels not seen since March and Bitcoin at 65k.

&#x200B;

**LTO - $267.30**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[The LTO train is a bumpy ride.](https://preview.redd.it/qmny9ib6x0m71.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6abe07b29cbb55a0911f3820afd79d5b10a3825)

Holders may be getting a bit of whiplash, but the end result of August is that LTO's value went up, and the project looks to be in recovery mode while moving with the rest of the market. Still a far way off from the huge run up we saw in March, but looking good like the vast majority of the crypto market in the meantime.

&#x200B;

**SOL - $5089.93**

&#x200B;

[Ok SOL, no one likes a showoff.](https://preview.redd.it/camcup9rx0m71.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3c8dfca9e56f0798448f729f3e250b8143ed0fd)

Not content with having a green month almost every single month since September, SOL decided August was the month where it had to 5x in price, because of course it did. SOL's trajectory in the last year has basically looked like a rocketship to the moon, torching holder's hands for 64x gains in the last financial year.  Remember to take profits, SOL holders!  


**XMR - $140.68**

&#x200B;

[Up, but somehow boring about it.](https://preview.redd.it/8t2p4egky0m71.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=8752154d0004b579ed0fe77c4c5b904fce9cc7dc)

On the slow gain train is XMR, which is probably the most boring crypto tracked in the challenge. Not once did it ever have a breakout move, and moves primarily with the market always. At least it's private!  


**XLM - $29.70**

&#x200B;

[XLM is actually doing really well! ](https://preview.redd.it/q5lzpmt8z0m71.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=94cb659d535060484df72dc9fb2cfea6d09f0e28)

I feel the worst for XLM because it didn't really have a fair shot, being included at what was basically the Bitcoin top as a substitute for DOGE. In order for XLM to break even it would have to hit $0.62 again. It's possible!

&#x200B;

 

The last time the portfolio was tracked, it was at **$3436.96** giving us a net gain of of **$5899.81** from August to September.

If the $500 (10,000 moons) had been left in moons, they would currently be worth **$2380.**

If the $500 had been left in BTC (0.0353 \* $52,500), it would be worth $**1853.25.**

The portfolio has once again heavily outperformed both MOON and BTC - Despite both performing exceptionally well over the last year - Moons at almost 5x and Bitcoin at almost 4x - But the portfolio currently averages 18.67x gains. Currently mostly carried by SOL!

&#x200B;

To shake up distribution a bit, we'll go in portfolio order rather than gainers.

&#x200B;

**ETH - $334.43**

&#x200B;

[Burn baby, burn!](https://preview.redd.it/26kl1vizikf71.png?width=559&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccfbc1bbc757494efc3f5399cc76e0fb8d9c699a)

ETH looks to have had a bit of a crabby month with Bitcoin bottoming out, but has since gotten the London upgrade and its price has reacted appropriately. ETH fans are probably very happy in terms of the development of the platform and taking small steps towards ETH 2.0.

&#x200B;

**NANO - $318.77**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Pretty boring ranges.](https://preview.redd.it/rc1axxpgjkf71.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=66847ebded97f1c639378d71f009a5102319d123)

&#x200B;

Haven't heard a lot about NANO since their network largely recovered from a crippling spam attack, and the price seems to reflect that reality. Trading has been roughly the same price as the last month, following Bitcoin around but slowly slipping farther out of the top 100.

&#x200B;

**ADA - $692.56**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Chart looks pretty familiar, right?](https://preview.redd.it/zlxru5zrjkf71.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=905f478e0f342533002c490d5654342efdec77a6)

&#x200B;

ADA seems to be following the trend in terms of most market movements, rising and falling with Bitcoin. No real recent news for the project so it largely slugs along with the rest of Crypto.

&#x200B;

**VET - $437.36**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Looking familiar... again!](https://preview.redd.it/29mywxz4kkf71.png?width=544&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0b249c0c63d21cc522187182ceb41c51bf81e79)

Though its chart looks largely like most of the rest of them, VET matches ETH in that it ended the month higher than it started the month, indicating a bit of an upward trajectory. 

&#x200B;

**XRP - $152.78**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Lows and highs.](https://preview.redd.it/wp52gmehkkf71.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e53f040a4b41f265e4cc37f605a92db9626a37e)

Still embroiled in the landmark SEC case, XRP took a larger hit followed with a larger rise than most of the rest of Crypto, bouncing back a huge amount from lows to a fairly healthy amount. XRP fans still anxiously await the result of the suit, which currently looks to favour the XRP side.

&#x200B;

**IOTA - $175.55**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Ending the month as it started](https://preview.redd.it/tffn3rvulkf71.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6e458d8bfa3dde39f986d2dc55dd5a6f1427164)

Nothing much doing with IOTA this month, looks to be largely following Bitcoin like a lot of the other projects, looking to see which way the wind blows.

&#x200B;

**LTO - $202.98**

&#x200B;

[A deviation from the mean](https://preview.redd.it/77tgs6u5mkf71.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=948e1cea52249e145d2636d3ea9804d61f8c4fa0)

LTO was hardest hit in recent months so it looks like it has been favourably recovering from its pullback. The dip hit it very lightly as it was already down immensely from its highs, and its bounce back has been looking great this month.

&#x200B;

**SOL - $989.93**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Dip can't keep this beast down](https://preview.redd.it/zye99bljmkf71.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0d6571a6da765559a82988ffb56717f96155208)

Keeping with its trend of strong performances, SOL continues to recover just as strong as it rose in the first place. After setting blistering all time highs for months, it cooled off to a more reasonable level only to end the month up, looking to reclaim its former glory already.

&#x200B;

**XMR - $112.79**

&#x200B;

[Showing strength.. for once!](https://preview.redd.it/fujkytw8nkf71.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cee56f25fd810099ab4f941ead446b474d62dae)

  
XMR has been a bit of a laggard in the competition but in the last several months looks to be pumping some iron, resulting in one of the larger % price gains in a while for the Crypto. Generally it falls in line with Bitcoin but seems to be deviating for once.

&#x200B;

**XLM - $19.83**

&#x200B;

[Poor XLM, not even doing that bad, just bought at the wrong time. :\(](https://preview.redd.it/z9okccgpokf71.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=66eef5527002ea34fdb281cf94806b2a3d4115e4)

It ended the month stronger than it started, but poor XLM is still lagging in the $50 department. Unfortunately, it was bought during the height of absolute insanity in place of DOGE, so it might need a bit of time to recover - Maybe even more than this challenge has to give.

&#x200B;

The last time the portfolio was tracked, it was at [$4,182.32](https://preview.redd.it/eerx1cy1wg371.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f2edc17367566f1b19634bce69e73109bde37a2), giving us a net loss of $-745.34 from June to August.

 If the $500 (10,000 moons) had been left in moons, they would currently be worth **$3140. (HUGE jump from last update)**

 If the $500 had been left in BTC (0.0353 \* $40,000), it would be worth $**1412.**

The portfolio is still largely outperforming Bitcoin but only slightly outperforming MOON, which is a huge surprise given the largely positive run of this.

USDC,cryptocurrency,CARDANO's strategy TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD BY 2025 has been right in front of your very eyes: an overview of what's to come in 2022 + why Africa is the key!,"I'll start with what's to come for 2022 and then move to Africa. A series of fortunate events leading to vision 2025. All info is widely available and verifiable. Sources and links given below.

Ecosystem growth in 2022:

1. [10+ DEXes](https://twitter.com/cardano_whale/status/1465907181086130179)**, built from ground up**, that will specifically use the advantage of the extended UTxO model. Note the emphasizes on ""built from ground up"" meaning that [they will be different from what you're used from the Dapps on the account-based model blockchains.](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/16/architecting-dapps-on-the-eutxo-ledger/)  Benchmarking shows that with the eUTXO model, [around 25 to 30 orders can be easily handled within one single transaction.](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1475523126343741448)
2. **Borrow and lending protocols + robust DeFI ecosystem dropping in Q1/Q2 '22** after auditing and testing on testnet. Remember that it took Ethereum 2.5 years to have cryptokitties and Solana over more than a year to have some decent DApps. Cardano entered the smart contract era on 9 September 2021 so Q1/Q2 is pretty damn fast and it's gonna give a shockwave to the entire ecosystem not to mention **biggest ADA supply crunch once DExes are running at full speed**. As the DeFi ecosystem starts to take off, an alliance was announced to help speed it on its way through  standardisation and best practice -> [Cardano DeFi Alliance](https://cardanodefialliance.org/).
3. [DJED](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/18/djed-implementing-algorithmic-stablecoins-for-proven-price-stability/):  **a crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin contract that acts as an autonomous bank**. I can't stress the importance of this enough. **Djed is the** ***first*** **coin to use formal verification to eliminate price volatility.**  The first implementation of a Djed stablecoin contract was [SigmaUSD](https://sigmausd.io/#/) on Ergo.
4. [**Hydra**](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/17/hydra-cardano-s-solution-for-ultimate-scalability/) **is Cardano's solution to ultimate layer 2 scalability** that aims to maximize throughput, minimize latency,  incurring low to no costs, and greatly reducing storage requirements.  Hydra introduces the concept of [isomorphic state channels](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/299.pdf):  that is, to reuse **the same ledger representation to yield uniform,  off-chain ledger siblings, which we call Heads** (hence the Hydra name,  which references the [mythological, multi-headed creature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra)).  Specifically for Cardano, this means that native assets, non-fungible  tokens (NFTs), and Plutus scripting are available inside *each* Hydra Head.  **Many  of the transactions currently handled by the main-chain or application  running on the main chain can benefit directly from Hydra, because it  understands just the same transaction formats and signatures.**  In a layer 2 system like Hydra, it is possible to achieve **confirmation times of** ***less than one second***. Throughput measured in TPS per Hydra head is mostly limited by the available hardware. In principle, **by adding increasing  numbers of Hydra heads to the system, arbitrarily high throughput can be  achieved by the system as a whole**. ( e.g. each stake pool on Cardano could achieve about 1000 TPS there are over 3000+ stake pools on Cardano right now so when implemented you could in theory achieve 3M+ TPS = 1000 TPS/stake pool \* 3000+ stake pools)
5. [Babel fees](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/25/babel-fees/) =  **being able to pay transaction fees in custom currencies! Potential to bring all ERC-20 tokens to Cardano** for obvious reasons ([see converter in action here](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/12/07/the-agix-erc20-converter-testnet-is-now-live/))... First, let us recall how **native assets** work in Cardano: Tokens can be created according to a minting policy and they **are treated natively in the ledger along with ada**. **Cardano's ledger adopts the  Extended UTXO (EUTXO) model**, and issuing a valid transaction requires consuming one or more UTXOs. A **UTXO  in Cardano may carry not just ada but in fact a token bundle that can  contain multiple different tokens,  both fungible and non-fungible**. In this way **it is possible to write  transactions that transfer multiple different tokens with a single  UTXO.** **Transaction fees in the ledger are denominated in ada according to a function fixed as a ledger parameter**. A powerful feature of Cardano's EUTXO model is that the **fees** required for a valid  transaction **can  be predicted precisely prior to posting it. This is a  unique feature  that is not enjoyed by other ledger arrangements (such as  the  account-based model used in Ethereum)**. Indeed, in this latter  case  the fees needed for a transaction may change during the time it  takes  for the transaction to settle, since other transactions may  affect the  ledger's state in between and influence the required cost  for processing  the transaction.""
6. [**NFTs are booming**](https://opencnft.io/marketplace) and yet you only hear about ETH/SOL NFT stuff. **106M ADA traded over 9 NFT marketplaces in just 6 months!!** I expect 2022 to be a game changer when it comes to **GamiFi, DeFi and RealFi which will lead (did I mention this already :)?) to the the biggest supply crunch of ADA** since Cardano's inception.  **This means that anyone can mint their own tokens, including  non-fungible tokens (NFTs) without needing a smart contract.**
7. The first stage of the **Voltaire** era aka **Project Catalyst:** which is the **biggest decentralized fund (any chain)** right now! It has over **700 million ADA and it's used to fund all kind of projects** including some of the DEXes, NFT marketplaces, and other lending protocols mentioned above. **That's approx. 1 billion $** in our war chest to fund the devs on Cardano and create their DApps and other products. It's been successfully active for almost a year now.
8. [**Mithril**](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/29/mithril-a-stronger-and-lighter-blockchain-for-better-efficiency/) boosts the efficiency of *full node clients* or applications.  It ensures **fast and secure synchronization of the full node data,  significantly improving time and required resources including  computation, network exchange, and local storage while keeping  high-level security guarantees.** Mithril is also applicable to *light clients and mobile applications*, ensuring a trustless approach. **Another significant advantage is using Mithril signatures for running** ***sidechains***\*\*.  The main blockchain can connect to **different sidechains that can even  have different consensus protocols**. Mithril has benefits in lightweight  blockchain state verification, and thus, certificates can validate the  current state of the specific blockchain as well as the correctness of  forward and backward transfers in a secure way. Finally,  stake-based voting applications and governance solutions can use Mithril  regardless of the voting protocol‚Äôs complexity. Mithril signatures can  be utilized for secure and lightweight tally verification. This is also  useful in governance when stakeholders go through a decentralized  decision-making process and provide the final result in an easy and  verifiable way.
9. So, **sidechains and different consensus protocols you say**? Yessir, that's called **Basho** phase on Cardano. There's another cool thing from dcSpark called [Milkomeda](https://dcspark.gitbook.io/milkomeda/):  **Milkomeda will launch in both of these ecosystems (Solana & Cardano) and deploy EVM-based sidechains for each. This will aid them in acquiring existing Solidity developers out there who are interested in building dApps for whole new user bases.** With a first mover advantage for sidechains on both chains, expect to ride the initial wave of excitement and build a protocol that makes a difference and lasts.

**Now AFRICA!**

[Try to watch this short video](https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/rekl92/africa_and_the_world_has_crypto_the_answer/) to understand why they are the key and why Cardano team has been over there for almost 5 years now.

6. [Source](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/26/africa-is-where-the-tough-get-going/): Why Africa?

If the whole world is globalizing and changing, you want to be  where all the systems are going to change first, because if you get it  right, **more wealth will be created here over the next three decades than  in Europe, the United States and China combined.** That‚Äôs just how it is.  It‚Äôs why the US got on top in the 20th century. It just simply had a  better system than the competitors. And everything resets when you have  technological change. **We now live in a global economy. People from  Africa are going to be on equal footing with people in Europe and  America if we do things the right way. And then it‚Äôs a meritocratic  race, and I‚Äôm going to bet on the people who are tougher, more resilient  and more entrepreneurial 10 out of 10 times. They‚Äôre going to win ‚Äì  it‚Äôs just that simple.**¬†

So IOG has a pan-African view as a company. We started in a pretty  difficult country to do business in, Ethiopia, and you know what?  **Everywhere we looked, we saw well-educated, well-intentioned people who  really did want change. And they worked with us. Sometimes the system  worked against us; sometimes it worked with us. But everybody remembered  why they were there. And it was the privilege of my career to announce a  deal of five million people that could grow to 20 million, that could  grow to a national ID system of 110 million in just a few years, and  that could grow into a voting system, a payment settlement system.** It  can grow to anything. It‚Äôs kind of like the stem cell: once you‚Äôre in,  you‚Äôre in, and you can keep navigating and growing. And then how do we  take that to Kenya, to Nigeria? That‚Äôs 400 million people ‚Äì more than  the population of the entire United States ‚Äì within grasp in five to 10  years.

**What‚Äôs most extraordinary is that this will transform the lives of  people. Now, boring work has to be done, dry presentations given about  credential this and verification that. And they‚Äôre very necessary. But  at the core of all of that are people.**

6) [Crypto + identity solutions for Africa = RealFi:](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/25/welcome-to-the-age-of-realfi/)  By **integrating digital identity with Cardano, we can create real value and opportunity for people across the globe.**

Among nations with developed economic systems, **DeFi has  highlighted the potential for blockchain to disrupt financial ‚Äòlegacy‚Äô  systems and open up access to new users hunting for better yields and  moving liquidity** around. It has established an entirely new financial  paradigm and the **$100bn DeFi market is expected to grow significantly  over the next few years as models continue to evolve.**

However, as  much as the age of DeFi is creating fresh markets and driving  compelling new use cases, **it has also further highlighted the economic divide between people who can easily access financial products, and  those who cannot.**

**The reason why banks refuse credit or loans in emerging markets is  often that they don‚Äôt have enough data about the person or organization  intending to borrow.**

All the **necessary financial information can be stored and relayed  in a verifiable manner through an** [**Atala PRISM ID**](https://atalaprism.io/app)**.** The monetary building  bricks of DeFi can be used to structure these loans and hedge the  currency risk, while scalable payment rails provided by Cardano and  various layer 2 solutions will make it possible to transfer capital  across the world without friction.

[Atala Prism](https://www.atalaprism.io/)  is a **decentralized identity system that enables people to own their personal data and interact with organizations seamlessly, privately, and  securely. The Atala Prism team is integrating metadata to certify and  store DIDs and DID documents on Cardano.** Also, it will be possible not  only to create but also to revoke credentials such as university  certificates.

**Atala Trace and Atala Scan are being developed to  enable brand owners to improve the visibility over supply chain  processes and establish product provenance and auditability.** In these  cases, metadata integration will be used to record tamper-proof  supply-chain records.

**Cardano adds the final piece of the financial puzzle by unlocking real economic value at the end of the transaction chain:** ***personal identity...***

**Identity  is central to everything. Once someone has an economic identity, a  world of opportunity and inclusivity opens up. Real opportunity comes  with access to essential services that were hitherto out of reach. And  real finance, such as loans to open a business or maintain an existing  one. RealFi.**

**Identity can become an asset in so far as it can be a  substitute for collateral.** A lender's overriding concern is to ensure  that loans (plus any interest accrued) are paid back. One way of  enforcing this is by collateralizing the loan, but if the lender has  enough and clear information about a borrower (if they know the borrower  is a high-earner, or a long-standing customer), the lender might be  more inclined to forgo the collateral.

So there was so much hype around EOS how it did a bazillion TPS and was gonna overthrow ETH and all that.  Now its a ghost chain and the company that started it has like 200k in BTC and prolly that much in ETH.  Solana is hyped so much, but really the reason why it can do so many TPS and what not is because it takes a fucking supercomputer to run a node, and the project is centralized.

USDC,cryptocurrency,Hard Truth. If you were fine with Canada locking bank accounts you should be fine with Coinbase requiring information for transfers.,"I was having a conversation with a buddy who lives in Toronto and he was ranting about having to show proof of transfers out of Coinbase soon. (If you didn't know soon if you live in Canada you will have to explain where and why you are transferring anything over 1K out of Coinbase). 

Well he was also super for Canada locking bankaccounts of terrorists. (Which I get. I felt like the government was showing why decentralization was important and them locking accounts should not be allowed.) 

I told him it was a direct response to the events in Canada and he should just hold a cold wallet or something. He went on about it being too far and punishing normal people for a few bad apples. I said this is what people mean when they talk about a slippery slope. How would you identify those individuals face cameras? 


Long story short. Don't be okay with governments punishing people that you don't politically agree with. Eventually you may be on the other end or lumped up with them.",1188,2022-03-29 11:35:09,821
USDC,cryptocurrency,Governments Planning Global Coordinated Regulation of Crypto Currencies From October 2021 Onwards [Due Diligence],"# The worlds‚Äô wealthiest nations are aiming for cryptos, restricting, amongst others, the following:

* Peer-to-Peer Transactions;
* Stablecoins;
* Private wallets (cold storage, phone and desktop apps);
* Privacy (privacy coins, mixers, Decentralized exchanges, use of TOR and I2P);
* Former ICOs and Future Projects (DeFi, NFT, smart contacts, second layer solutions, and much more).

**In addition, these new regulations intend to:**

* Force those active in crypto to be licensed and regulated as banks (responsible for KYC and transaction tracking);
* Create full transparency for ALL transactions;
* Exclude and freeze assets of persons, activities, and countries labeled a ‚Äúrisk;‚Äù
* Force the inclusion of user information with all transactions;
* Revoke the license of those who don‚Äôt comply.

In short: they want to change the way the space can operate. As you‚Äôll discover, the regulation rolled out aim to create a system of complete transparency and control.

At the same time, regulatory clarity could pave the way for the next stage of adoption.

&#x200B;

## What Can You Get from This Due Diligence

For years, we wondered if governments would ‚Äúban Bitcoin.‚Äù As it turns out, they will not. Instead, they intent to simply absorb cryptos into the existing regulated financial system.

This due diligence is based on new international regulations. This DD reveals exactly what the coming regulations mean for cryptos, who is behind them, and how they will be implemented. Next, this DD highlights the most revealing and stunning clauses. And finally, it summarizes which activities are likely to thrive and which are bound to suffer, so that you can prepare yourself.

&#x200B;

## Why Now?

In 2018, the news that Facebook was creating a crypto currency shocked international regulators. Until then, they didn‚Äôt see cryptos as a risk to the stability of the global financial system. However, Libra, the coin Facebook proposed, was a so-called stablecoin; it maintains its value relative to fiat currencies such as the USD. They quickly realized what would happen when a company with a billion users creates an instant payment system that is cheaper, faster and more user-friendly than the current financial system.

This topic was discussed at the highest levels of government; the G20, an international forum for the governments and central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union. They engaged an organization called the Financial Action Task Force (**FATF**).

This organization has passed similar legislation for banking and financial service providers around the world. They are responsible for the fact that all crypto-currency exchanges where fiat is exchanged for cryptos have the same KYC and anti-money laundering requirements as banks. Now, they are going to use this framework to focus on the elements of the industry currently outside their control, and declare what is, and isn‚Äôt acceptable.

&#x200B;

## New Guidance on Bitcoin and Cryptos

The latest draft guidance of the FATF, to be implemented in July 2021, is called *‚ÄúGuidance for a risk-based approach to virtual assets and VASPs‚Äù* (**GVA**) \[1\]. This DD is based on this GVA.

As you will learn, they have a deep understanding of what is happening in the space. Moreover, they take the expansive view that *‚Äúmost arrangements currently in operation,‚Äù* including *‚Äúself-categorized P2P platforms‚Äù* may have a *‚Äúparty involved at some stage of the product‚Äôs development and launch‚Äù* who will be covered by this new legislation. (GVA, p29)

&#x200B;

## Why do the FATF regulations have global reach?

Since FATF isn‚Äôt an official government agency of any country, they cannot create law. They issue what is known as ‚Äúsoft-laws‚Äù: recommendations and guidance. Only when this guidance is implemented in the laws of the countries, they become ‚Äúhard-laws‚Äù with real power.

In theory, they are thus subjected to the formal law-making process of law-giving countries. However, countries that don‚Äôt participate are placed on a list of ‚Äúnon-cooperative jurisdictions.‚Äù They then face restricted access to the financial system and ostracism from the international community. For this reason, almost all nations implement these recommendations.

It also must be said that national governments, especially in the Western world, highly value this kind of international cooperation and the power it gives them. Many such treaties are passed into law with little opposition or delay.

Once these treaties are accepted, they become part of a body of law called international law, a type of law in many cases superseding national laws. Unknown to the general public, international law is increasingly being used as a backdoor for passing invasive regulations such as these.

It must be noted that people working for this Paris-based organization are faceless bureaucrats who have not been elected, their procedures and budget are not subjected to democratic oversight, and they are almost impossible to remove from power. Like most international organizations, they fall under the Vienna Conference on Diplomatic Intercourse and Immunities.\[2\] As such, they enjoy immunity for their actions, are exempt from administrative burdens in the countries they are active, such as taxes, and free from most COVID travel restrictions.

&#x200B;

## When will this ‚ÄúGuidance‚Äù be Implemented?

The GVA was published in March to be subjected to public consultation. This gives it the appearance of the public having a say in the implementation of it, but when you read it carefully they will consider feedback only on ‚Äúrelevant issues‚Äù they themselves selected. Other feedback might be considered in the next review in 12 months (by then, most current recommendations will likely have been passed into law). In other words, this will be it, with minor adjustments.

June 2021 FATF previewed all feedback and July 2021 these new ‚Äúrecommendations‚Äù would become official. However, last Friday, June 25, FATF postponed the finalization of the recommendations to October 2021. From that day forwards, we can expect these recommendations to start being implemented in our national legal systems, and as such, start affecting our lives.

This process has been successfully used in the banking system and tax systems‚Äïit is now coming for crypto. It is worth noting that individual countries might decide on even more specific or explicit prohibitions on top of this. It is also worth noting that these regulations do not apply to central bank-issued digital currencies.

&#x200B;

## How Will Cryptos Be Regulated?

Before we can understand how FATF proposes to regulate cryptos, we must learn what they mean when they talk about a Virtual Asset:

‚Äú*A virtual asset is a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or investment purposes. Virtual assets do not include digital representations of fiat currencies, securities and other financial assets that are already covered elsewhere in the FATF Recommendations.‚Äù* (GVA, p98)

Cryptos will not be outright banned. They will be regulated via an indirect method; those who facilitate virtual asset transactions, are designated as a Virtual Asset Service Provider, or VASP.

Next, all VASPs will be subjected to similar regulation as banks. The definition of VASP is so wide that most current projects in the crypto space are covered by it.

&#x200B;

## Definition of a VASP:

\*‚Äú\****VASP: Virtual asset service provider*** *means any natural or legal person who* \[...\] *as a business conducts one or more of the following activities or operations for or on behalf of another natural or legal person:*

1. *exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies;*
2. *exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets;*
3. *transfer of virtual assets (In this context of virtual assets, transfer means to conduct a transaction on behalf of another natural or legal person that moves a virtual asset from one virtual asset address or account to another.);*
4. *safekeeping and/or administration of virtual assets or instruments enabling control over virtual assets; and*
5. *participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer‚Äôs offer and/or sale of a virtual asset.‚Äù* (GVA, p18)

&#x200B;

## Many Organizations and Individuals Will Be Designated as VASPs:

A VASP is **any natural or legal person**, and *‚Äúthe obligations in the FATF Standards stem from the underlying financial services offered without regard to an entity‚Äôs operational model, technological tools, ledger design, or any other operating feature.‚Äù* (GVA, p21)

The expansiveness of these definitions represents a conscious choice by the FATF. *‚ÄúDespite changing terminology and innovative business models developed in this sector, the FATF envisions very few VA arrangements will form and operate without a VASP involved at some stage.‚Äù* (GVA, p29)

For those wondering if they are a VASP, the following general questions can help guide the answer:

* ‚Äú*who profits from the use of the service or asset;*
* *who established and can change the rules;*
* *who can make decisions affecting operations;*
* *who generated and drove the creation and launch of a product or service;*
* *who possesses and controls the data on its operations; and*
* *who could shut down the product or service.*

*Individual situations will vary and this list offers only some examples.‚Äù* (GVA, p30)

&#x200B;

## What Are VASPs Obliged to Do?

All VASPs will be forced to implement KYC legislation and monitor transactions. They become fully regulated entities who need to obtain a license. Individuals can also be labeled a VASP.

The real kicker is that all activities not part of the regulated system are labeled as ‚Äúhigh-risk.‚Äù And as such, those performing such activities become high-risk persons, which could have repercussions for accessing the wider financial system.

It is important to understand that most peer-to-peer activities themselves will not be banned (although individual countries may do so on their own accord).

However, transactions with a ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù background will be tainted and scrutinized. Exchanges risk losing their license if they deal with them, and many will simply choose not to allow them. It might get to a point where proceeds from certain peer-to-peer transactions or private wallets are no longer usable in the financial system, at least not without extensive due diligence.

&#x200B;

## New Government Organizations for Overseeing the Crypto Market

Every country should assign a ‚Äúcompetent authority‚Äù to monitor the crypto space and communicate with competent authorities in other countries: *‚ÄúVASPs should be supervised or monitored by a competent authority, not a self-regulatory body (SRB), which should conduct risk-based supervision or monitoring.‚Äù* (GVA, p45)

This can be an existing regulatory body, such as a central bank or a tax authority, or a specialist VASP supervisor. (GVA, p91)

&#x200B;

## What Activities Will Be Regulated?

This chapter highlights crypto activities, currently considered completely normal, and details how they are to be regulated.

&#x200B;

**Peer-to-Peer transactions:** transactions without the involvement of a VASP. They are not subjected to regulation, but are a ‚Äúrisk.‚Äù That‚Äôs why the FATF recommends increased monitoring and restriction of this kind of activity, and possibly reject licensing VASPs that engage in it.

&#x200B;

**Stablecoins:** are considered a major risk because they think they are more likely to reach mass adoption. They may be targeted at the level of the central developer or governance body, which will be held accountable for the implementation of these recommendations across their ecosystem.

&#x200B;

**Unhosted Wallets:** Commonly used private wallets are called: ‚Äúunhosted wallets.‚Äù As mentioned, the FATF suggests denying licensing VASPs *‚Äúif they allow transactions to/from non-obliged entities (i.e., private / unhosted wallets).‚Äù* (GVA, p37) VASPS should also *‚Äútreat such VA transfers as higher risk transactions that require enhanced scrutiny and limitations.‚Äù* (GVA, p60)

&#x200B;

**Client Information to Collect by VASPs:** all VASPs should collect information on their clients such as the customer‚Äôs name and further identifiers such as physical address, date of birth, and a unique national identifier number (e.g., national identity number or passport number). VASPs should conduct ongoing due diligence on the business relationship and the customer‚Äôs financial activities.

&#x200B;

**Travel Rule:** FATF recommends applying traditional bank wire transfer requirements on crypto currency transactions; this is called the travel rule.

It includes the obligation to obtain, hold, and transmit required originator and beneficiary information associated with VA transfers in order to identify and report suspicious transactions, take freezing actions, and prohibit transactions with designated persons and entities.

Information accompanying all qualifying transfers should always contain:

* ‚Äú*the name of the originator;*
* *the originator account number where such an account is used to process the transaction;*
* *the originator‚Äôs address, or national identity number, or customer identification number, or date and place of birth;*
* *the name of the beneficiary; and*
* *the beneficiary account number where such an account is used to process the transaction.‚Äù* (GVA, p53)

&#x200B;

**Instant transfer of ID information tied to transactions:** Obliged entities should submit the required information simultaneously with the batch VA transfer, although the required information need not be recorded on the blockchain or other Distributed Ledged Technology (DLT) platform itself.

&#x200B;

**Categorize Clients and Activities According to their level of Risk:** VA and VASP activity will be subject to a ‚ÄúRisk-Based Approach.‚Äù In practice, this means that each client and activity is categorized by their risk level. Risk levels are determined based on a variety of factors. Persons or activities considered a risk can see enhanced due diligence and even their ability to use VASPs reduced.

&#x200B;

**Ongoing Transaction Monitoring:** Every customer is assigned a risk profile. Based on this profile, customer transactions will be monitored *to det*ermine whether those transactions are consistent with the VASP‚Äôs information about the customer and the nature and purpose of the business relationship.

&#x200B;

**Transactions tight to Digital IDs:** In the future, VA transactions might need to be subject to digital identity regulations, also being developed by the FATF.

&#x200B;

**Freezing of Assets:** Cryptos can be frozen when the holder is suspect of a crime, as part of other investigations, when the VA is related to terrorist financing, and when related to financial sanctions. The freezing of VAs will happen regardless of the property laws of national legal frameworks, and it will not be necessary that a person be convicted of a crime.

&#x200B;

**Anonymity-Enhanced Cryptocurrencies (AECs) and Privacy Tools:** The GVA specifically targets tools intended to improve privacy, such as: anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies (AECs) such as Monero, mixers and tumblers, decentralized platforms and exchanges, use of the Internet Protocol (IP) anonymizers such as The Onion Router (TOR), the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) and other darknets, which may further obfuscate transactions or activities.

This includes *‚Äúnew illicit financing typologies‚Äù* \[Author: DeFI?\]*,* and the *increasing use of virtual-to-virtual layering schemes that attempt to further obfuscate transactions in a comparatively easy, cheap, and secure manner‚Äù* \[Author: Lighting, Schnorr, Taproot?\]*. (GVA, p6)*

And if a VASP *‚Äúcannot manage and mitigate the risks posed by engaging in such activities, then the VASP should not be permitted to engage in such activities.‚Äù* (GVA, p51)

&#x200B;

**Obligations to get a License for all VASPs:** The GVA intends to subject all VASPs to a licensing scheme: *‚Äúat a minimum, VASPs should be required to be licensed or registered in the jurisdiction(s) where they are created.‚Äù* (GVA, p40)

Moreover, each jurisdiction might require licensing for those servicing clients in their jurisdiction.

It bears repeating that a natural person can also be designated as being a VASP and be required to obtain a license to work on a crypto project. Moreover, the competent authorities get to determine who can and cannot become a VASP, and monitor the Internet for unlicensed activities by engaging in *‚Äúchain analysis, webscraping for advertising and solicitations, feedback from the general public, information from reporting institutions (STRs), non public information such as applications, law enforcement and intelligence reports.‚Äù (GVA, p41)*

&#x200B;

**Bitcoin ATMs:** ‚ÄúProviders of kiosks‚Äîoften called ‚ÄúATMs,‚Äù bitcoin teller machines,‚Äù ‚Äúbitcoin ATMs,‚Äù or ‚Äúvending machines‚Äù‚Äîmay also fall into the above definitions.

&#x200B;

**Decentralized Exchanges:** According to the GVA, the concept of a decentralized exchange doesn‚Äôt exist, since these regulations are technology neutral. As such, those running the exchange can be held liable for implementing these regulations.

&#x200B;

**Multisig Contracts:** In case of partial control of keys, like a multisig or any kind of shared transaction, the providers of such services could be subjected to this regulation as well.

&#x200B;

**Regulation of Future Developments:** Countries should identify and assess the money laundering and terrorist financing risks relating to the development of new products and business practices. The result might be that the development of new projects need some sort of approval process.

&#x200B;

**International Cooperation of Competent Authorities:** And finally, the FATF Recommendations encourages competent authorities to provide the fullest range of international co-operation with other competent authorities.

&#x200B;

## What Will Not Be Regulated?

Some good news is that what makes crypto, crypto, remains unregulated; peer-to-peer transactions themselves, small transactions and ecommerce, open source development, and cold storage will remain lawful.

Specifically exempt are persons facilitating the technical process, such as miners and nodes (called validators), and those that host, facilitate and develop the network. In addition, small transactions under 1.000 USD/EUR are exempt, although basic identity information will be recorded when done through a VASP.

&#x200B;

## What Will Be the Outcome of These Regulations?

This regulation, like many of its kind, will have (un)intended consequences. The stated goal of increased transparency in the space might very well be achieved, reveling the proceeds of certain crimes.

However, a secondary goal is clear for those understanding these kinds of open-ended legislation; controlling what can and cannot be done with crypto in the real world by labeling certain activities and undesired persons as ‚Äúhigh risk.‚Äù

It will be increasingly difficult to deal with proceeds from the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù activities, especially for people from high-risk countries, engaged in high-risk activities, or just being considered a high-risk person.

In addition, it will become expensive and technologically challenging to comply with this legislation. Small companies with unique business models might find it impossible to survive. Only the large regulated entities might remain in existence. This is a common result of regulation that is welcomed by regulators; a few large companies are easier to regulate than one thousand small ones. In some cases, the large participants welcome regulations as well, as it reduces competition. The same happened in the banking sector, for example.

Other downsides are that such regulations smother many otherwise beneficial technological projects in the crib and criminalize perfectly legal activities and the innocent citizen performing them. The loss of privacy will also increase security risks, especially for those living in dangerous countries.

&#x200B;

## The Crypto World at a Crossroads:

It is hard to determine how specific projects and the crypto space in general are going to be affected; especially since this is not the final guidance. Each national government will have a slightly different interpretation of these regulations, as well as existing laws and precedent in their own country. In addition, individual VASPs will interpret these regulations according to the viewpoint of their legal departments, as well. Cryptos will become a regulatory minefield.

A natural consequence of these regulations is that projects and participants in the crypto space will be divided into two categories: those who do/can meet these regulations, and those who do/cannot.

&#x200B;

## Potential Winners

First will be those that will fully comply with these regulations. In terms of participants, these will be the big exchanges and onramps, banks, and institutional investors. A lot of participants exclusively use exchanges (VASPs) already for their coins anyway, and for them nothing changes. In fact, additional regulations might help institutional adoption, an idea supported by the fact that the Bank of International Settlements issued new guidance for banks on the prudential treatment of crypto assets.\[3\]

Crypto assets which might succeed in such an environment are projects that have focused on transparency and KYC from the start, or those who are already established too decentralized and operate without any historic VASPs.

&#x200B;

## Potential Losers:

Next, there are the activities that are specifically targeted by this regulation; peer-to-peer transactions, privacy coins, decentralized exchanges, decentralized finance, and other peer-to-peer systems. It appears that such projects have only one option and that is to go fully decentralized. Which could actually make them attractive for some.

It is worth repeating that in principle, peer-to-peer systems are not against the law. Those participating in them should however accept that part of their assets and proceeds exist outside the regulated financial system, and that by engaging in them they might be labeled a ‚Äúrisk.‚Äù

Finally, there will be projects that fall in between: they are either too centralized to become fully decentralized and considered too ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù to be licensed. Such projects will experience significant headwind. Think about the aforementioned stablecoins, certain decentralized finance applications, certain self-hosted wallets (especially when facilitating exchange functions), and future ICOs.

Current projects that are still too centralized are a big question mark. Especially those who have leading individuals still in control of ‚Äúroad-maps,‚Äù or those relying on ‚Äúgoverning councils.‚Äù Those persons might suddenly be designated a VASP and forced to monitor the individuals and transactions on their network (a big downside as compared to the projects already decentralized).

&#x200B;

## TLDR;

**Governments at the highest levels (G20) commissioned an organization called FATF to come up with international regulations for cryptos. They are using international law frameworks that supersede national legislation and will force every country in the world to comply.**

**Their main goal is to keep crypto activity restricted to licensed and regulated service providers. A long list of ordinary crypto activities are now labeled a ‚Äúrisk.‚Äù Engaging in them will result in increased scrutiny and possible difficulties accessing the wider financial system.**

**It remains to be seen how this will affect the crypto world. Over time, it could likely split the crypto space in fully regulated (semi) centralized, and unregulated decentralized projects. The winners will likely be the projects that thrive in either of those; the losers likely those fitting in neither...**

**NOTE**: I uploaded this DD first on /r/bitcoin last week, and was asked to post it here. The recommendations were supposed to be finalized in July, but last Friday it was announced that they will now be finalized and implemented with priority by October 2021.

# Could it be that all along we have been in a mid-cycle price correction?

It never really felt like we were entering a bear market and that it was the end of the bull run.

Here are 10 important reasons why I believe we could be on the cusp of entering a potential second half of this bull run.

&#x200B;

1. **The crypto market cap has increased by $672 Billion in less than three weeks; It stood at $1.25 Trillion on the 20th of July and it is now sitting at $1.92 Trillion**: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/global\_charts](https://www.coingecko.com/en/global_charts) (For context; July 20 started as the GDP of Mexico, gained Sweden & Greece in 3 weeks, and is now Italy. If crypto were a country it would be the 8th richest country in the world.)
2. **Bitcoin has broken through the 200-day moving average of $45k and is currently testing resistance at $46k (a number it hasn't seen in three months) successful breakout from that would have the potential to yield an initial upside target towards $50k-$55k** [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-returns-above-%2440k-faces-resistance-at-%2445k-%2450k-2021-08-06](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-returns-above-%2440k-faces-resistance-at-%2445k-%2450k-2021-08-06)
3. **Ethereum had a highly successful London Hard Fork**, with EIP-1559 burning 3.56 ETH/min (the effects are already evident as more than $55M worth of ETH have been burned) **Proving that the Ethereum ecosystem is able to make significant positive changes & bringing is much closer to the market-moving event of the Ethereum 2.0 Transition**: [https://fortune.com/2021/08/05/ethereum-update-vitalik-buterin-emissions-energy-use/](https://fortune.com/2021/08/05/ethereum-update-vitalik-buterin-emissions-energy-use/) and [https://etherchain.org/burn](https://etherchain.org/burn)
4. **People using high leverage to short the market have been getting Rekt lately**, **on August 6 there were USD$500M liquidations--70.87% of them bears ($354.87M) and 29.13% Bulls ($145.85M)**: [https://www.bybt.com/LiquidationData](https://www.bybt.com/LiquidationData)
5. **The crypto market has been in a state of either fear or extreme fear for the past few months (with sellers/bears dominating), but in the past week we have been in the green/greed zone with Buyers/Bulls dominating according to Crypto's 'The Fear & Greed Index'**: [https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/)
6. **The Total Value Locked in Defi has also been increasing rapidly, going from $55 Billion on July 20 to $80.5 Billion today**: [https://defipulse.com/](https://defipulse.com/)
7. In late July **Germany took a major step in the crypto space by passing a law that allows so-called 'spezialfonds' to allocate up to 20% of their capital in crypto assets. Considering Germany is among the biggest economies in the world this is very significant as there is potential for more than $400 Billion being injected into the cryptomarket**: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/german-crypto-startups-welcome-415b-143016237.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/german-crypto-startups-welcome-415b-143016237.html)
8. **Eth went from a July 20 price of $1,755 to $3,150 in less than three weeks (and getting close to a $400 Billion market capitalization)** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum)

USDC,cryptocurrency,CoinSpot crypto exchange needs to show USD prices for all coins listings. Why is it only AUD?,,0,2024-08-08 09:04:27,0
USDC,cryptocurrency,How will crypto ever be an alternative to fiat if literally all major stable coins are pegged to USD?,"I see all this cope from people that say shit like ""I live in Asia we don't give a fuck about US laws"".  Well guess what?  Crypto prices are directly impacted by the US financial laws because it's all pegged to USD.  Crypto prices are measured in USD, and stablecoins are pegged to USD. 

So how in the hell can anyone make the argument that just because they live outside the US, the SEC crackdown on crypto doesn't matter to them?  Unless some alternative currency can challenge the US world reserve currency status and people start pegging crypto prices to that currency, or perhaps BTC itself can perhaps become it's own ""reserve currency"" and you can actually purchase everyday goods directly in BTC that floats independently of USD, then crypto will ALWAYS be DIRECTLY INFLUENCED by actions taken by the US government crackdowns.

USDC,cryptocurrency,I calculated how much a coin would be worth from a 1K investment now if it ever reaches back to its all time high.,"You can see the glass half full or half empty.  If you believe that your favorite cryptocurrency will get back to its ATH here is how much it would be worth with a 1K USD investment.  Glass empty crowd here is how much some of these coins has dropped from ATH. 

For example, for BTC a 1K investment now, if and when it reaches back to its ATH would be 3.4K.  For ETH it would be 4.3 K and for something like DOT it would be 7.8 K or HNT it would be 5.9K.

TLDR; are you a glass half full or empty? If you think your crypto will reach its all time high again then its a simple decision. 1K in BTC 3.4K and 1K in LRC is 9.5 K. Half empty, LRC is down 89% and BTC is down 71%

addendum: as pointed below - for shit & giggles here is how it would look like for the infamous LUNA classic:

USDC,cryptocurrency,A year ago today Terra USD began it's depeg from $1. In seven days the price of the stablecoin dropped to $.16 and the price of Luna dropped to . 0001. With both dropping further over the following weeks. Remembering what happened.,"A year ago today Terra USD began it's final depeg from $1 with the price sitting at $.9999 after two days of fighting to hold the peg, the price plunged down to $.80 and then $.16 by the end of the week. A year later the price of the unbacked stablecoin sits at $.018.

Luna was sitting at $77.47 a year ago today a week later the circulating supply increased from 342M to 6.5T in one week with the price dropping to $.0001. The current price today is $.00009

[Terra Luna - 1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/drj8awlw18ya1.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=b26cbbfbd61af1fe94f39e3025e694eb2b764c40)

This post shows the one year increase in the circulating supply. Notice the huge spike at the beginning coincided with the last days of the depeg. 342M to 6.5T

[This post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uo4337/luna_supply_has_inflated_425_since_may_9th/) detailed what was happening when Terra USD depegged and was a warning for people not to buy.

>UST and Luna price are directly related - You can burn Luna and mint UST, or you can burn UST and mint Luna. On May 8th (not including any fees you could burn about 60 UST ($60) to get 1 Luna ($60) - when UST started depegging people became financially incentivized to burn UST and convert it to Luna - increasing the supply of Luna. Since demand isn't keeping up with the increased supply - the price of Luna is continuing to crash. Currently with 1 UST worth $.55 and 1 Luna worth $.0058 (not including fees you can mint 330.57 Luna for $1 (true dollar) of UST.

No post on the failure of Luna would be complete without the [""FUD post""](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tbcrkh/explain_to_me_how_terraluna_is_not_a_scam/?context=3) that aged like fine wine. On March 10th 2022, two months before the final depeg a Reddit User by the name of /u/cwm9 wrote a post challenging the CryptoCurrency Reddit community to explain why Terra Luna wasn't a scam. In that post he created a hypothetical of what would happen to Terra in the event of a depeg which was contrary to the narrative being spread about a depeg event, and to his credit it happened exactly as they suggested.

>But go the other way: when people start selling their UST because they want to go back to bitcoin, they mint Luna and sell it. Now the price of Luna goes down. The fact that the price is going down and total coins minted is rising encourages the selling of Luna making the price drop farther. If the price drops too far, it can no longer support the burning of UST to get a dollar by selling Luna.",978,2023-05-06 14:56:12,377
USDC,cryptocurrency,"The Great Moon Experiment: 10,000 in Moons - $500 USD - 10 Coins on Binance, Redditors pick the Coins. - March 5th Update","That's right, we're officially 4 months in from the [start of the project](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/joj3q6/the_great_moon_experiment_beginning_today/) and Crypto keeps chugging. We started the month with Bitcoin at $36k, Elon Musk started tweeting, businesses started buying, we hit 58k (another new all time high) and we've been going back and forth from there.

So, with this in mind, how'd Reddits chosen coins hold up? 

The [spreadsheet is updated for the month and good to go.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ix2NquwnxQq5GHy9AfJfJaP1SrgdQ19DewuCBUFXRrQ/)

**Without further adieu:**

[Monero continues to follow Bitcoin.](https://preview.redd.it/svxxqtlp08l61.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f550dc6ad86092de3656e9e1cd61123563783b5)

**#10: XMR - $96.09**

Monero continues to keep gains hidden from the challenge and continues its hot streak as the portfolios worst performer month over month. Its charts continue to mirror Bitcoin almost exactly and nothing really new has changed since the last month. Good news for stability at least - Darknet buyers and sellers can continue to expect a stable price for their illicit wares.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[A wild ride.](https://preview.redd.it/07udm50918l61.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6876ef42496db4eba1dc35fa6db06ab32d1d73d)

&#x200B;

**#9: XRP - $97.97**

It's been interesting for XRP at least - With the craziness surrounding the SEC, exchanges delisting, crazy pump groups, and all sorts of stuff, XRP first followed Bitcoin and then went wild and wacky for a bit. It's since reverted to the mean and continues to underperform after it's incredible start to the challenge. We'll have to see where regulation and threats to the platform take it in the future.

&#x200B;

[Even the ghostbusters knew not to cross the streams.](https://preview.redd.it/8swsu6or18l61.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=841d87865d55e97c9454ba856d9da86196d60ebb)

&#x200B;

**#8: ETH - $181.69**

ETH started the month hot hot hot, as it looked to be gaining ground on Bitcoin. Bitcoin however had other ideas, and it's since cooled off to largely follow it with huge gas fees and crippling usability issues coming to the forefront to new users experiencing it for the first time. A hot performer hitting all time highs, ETH has pulled back a bit so we'll have to see where it goes from here.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[More all time highs - At least after the token split.](https://preview.redd.it/qjw94byf28l61.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8dadda99c13d26bf657af68c472c5c3ffe773a7)

&#x200B;

**#7: VET - $251.92**

Kind of crazy how a coin that's gone up over 500% in the last 4 months is *vastly underperforming in this portfolio.* VET hit two different all time highs this month and pulled back a bit after a bit of the shine wore off. Looks like the project is getting a little bit of momentum in it at last, as stagnant VTHO charts have doubled and tripled in days instead of free falling constantly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[More all time high shines.](https://preview.redd.it/x4r52b0038l61.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=3046b559bba5dffd934f36121f1e992725b80d4b)

**#6: LTO - $267.49**

&#x200B;

Another one that's been hitting blistering all time highs, but is still somehow underperforming and is bottom 50% in this portfolio, LTO has breached the $0.40 mark 3 times this month alone. It keeps returning to the mean but keeps trying to break out. Volume seems high throughout but lack of viable exchanges for US residents appears to be holding it back somewhat.

&#x200B;

[Looks like 2017 is back on the menu.](https://preview.redd.it/y6u2ckeg38l61.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e6522bc05182466a8f34d7e0fbfd3b8fd237a1b)

**#5: IOTA - $287.64**

It's not hitting 2017 highs - *Yet.* But it looks like the tangle is back on the menu with IOTA having a blistering near 300% rally in February after crabbing for the majority of the challenge so far. IOTA appears to be having a huge price breakout and is looking to regain spots on the marketplace after a slow last couple of years. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Speaking of blistering rallies..](https://preview.redd.it/anv10m4148l61.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ff62f14731685f8f8ff0abd94154f1ccd429d94)

**#4: SOL - $345.43**

A hot commodity last month, SOL figured it would simply triple in February just to outdo all its critics. A concern about increased circulating supply in February was smashed to bits as SOL not only posted multiple all time highs but had a disgusting pace this month even after pulling back - Its portfolio value doubled this month alone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Why put a price graph when this is how it'll end up anyways?](https://preview.redd.it/rf0d7ash48l61.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=57eab7fb69453b4df29607db38bc9fcb64a4f9cc)

**#3: NANO - $374.59**

NANO is another that isn't going anywhere near all time highs, but the price more than doubled since the start of the month before reverting to the mean. It's still up a giant amount and still a strong performer since its buy at a comparatively low price at the beginning of the challenge. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[This is how ADA is rolling in February.](https://i.redd.it/p5uarsdr68l61.gif)

**#2: ADA - $594.74**

ADA decided to make all other coins save one look bad this month, going wild by not only tripling, but by holding the vast majority of its gains, where other coins did not.  With Bitcoin's pullback, ADA has only looked stronger and the faithful were rewarded with a new all time high, finally putting the memories of 2017 behind them as they look forward into the future.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[We all knew this was coming.](https://preview.redd.it/8cabcmyk58l61.jpg?width=590&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cf16dfd8f7b95e4f2eaf3d5ce8868d03ad2ac91)

&#x200B;

**#1: DOGE - $995.10**

&#x200B;

King of the ring around here is still DOGE, after retracing from a blistering, comically insane rally, it still holds strong at **20x gains from the original buyin.** With Elon tweeting about it, WSB buying in, DOGE is STILL retracing and STILL the biggest gainer by a country mile.  Not even close, baybay.

&#x200B;

 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Our portfolio ended last month at  $2396.36, giving a total gain of **1096.65 in February.**

If the $500 (10,000 moons) had been left in moons, they would currently be worth $**779.**

If the $500 had been left in BTC (0.0353 \* $48,458), it would be worth $**1710.56**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Reddit's portfolio has outperformed both Bitcoin and Moons by a country mile.

USDC,cryptocurrency,The (terrifying) % of Totaly Supply of Cryptocurrencies Currently Owned by the Top 100 Addresses...Do you know what (who) you're investing in?,"Like many, when I got into crypto many years ago, I was personally attracted to the idea of a decentralized network, which isn't owned by an elite few, or some middle-man.

Today, it seems the average newcomer has little to no interest in this principle. Moreover, I find it interesting that many who've even been interested/invested in cryptocurrency, continue to show minimal interest in some core principles of economics, such as: Market capitalization, 'Tokenomics', reading a whitepaper, trading/investment principals....and possibly most disturbingly **Distribution of Tokens (wealth)!**

Imagine for a moment a small elite group of 100 people, in control of assets used by millions. Able to manipulate the market at will, and cash in on their centralized game at any time...Its a scary fate to imagine, especially if you're one of those players in their game.

The truth is that this isn't imaginary....it's quite literally what the current cyrpto market looks like...

Enter, **Shiba Inu....Where 82.14%** of all tokens are owned by just 100 people!

Or even worse **Binance...Where 98.8% of USD coin** and **95.57% of Binance Coin** is owned by the Top 100 holders.

I know what you're thinking...another post shaming SHIBA, blah, blah, blah....Well, you're right. But, they're not alone. Let's take a look at some of the other most popular crypto currencies, and how they match up (w. sources):
