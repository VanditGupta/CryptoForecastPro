SOL,cryptocurrency,Why Solana sucks ?,"I always see everywhere in DeFi that Solana is garbage. People tell me they prefer Ethereum and Sol won't last cause it's just shit.
  
My question is why?
  
What did i miss? Sol is fast and cheap, and except few network shutdowns it seems to work well.  
Is there a centralized issue? Some weird distribution? Are they just talking about the fact that a lot of shitcoins there can't last more than 10minutes?
  
Please help a crypto veteran that feels like a real noob when it's time to talk about Solana.",339,2024-02-18 22:35:56,795
SOL,cryptocurrency,10 things they don't want people to know or post about about Solana,"1. Bots constantly extract and **front-run users that have slippage.**
2. Transactions fail if you don't have enough slippage, and **users still have to pay for the failures.**
3. The blockchain has at least **12 major outages so far.**
4. Companies that run RPC endpoints can front-run you.
5. Solana has been **officially in beta 4.5 years so far.**
6. To become a **validator** you **need to be extremely wealthy.**
7. Their **TPS is marketed wrong**, it's not 3000 TPS, they include voting and failed transactions in this marketing to fool you, **it's actually about \~250 TPS.**
8. Solana **circulating supply increased by 59.09 million** over the last year which means **they printed $8.5 billion.**
9. Recently there was **a vote passed for validators (the rich) to get 100% of high priority transactions.**
10. **$7.5 billion SOL, is continued to be sold-off by FTX, a major unlock occurs in March 2025, and continued unlocks every month up till 2028.**

TL;DR: I added a comedy flair for ""comedy"" purposes because if someone told you that this is one of the major crypto networks you'd indeed think that crypto is a scam...

SOL,cryptocurrency,"Solend, the largest lending market on Solana is about to have a crippling liquidation of $170m SOL that could crash the network. To prevent this, the decentralized protocol is proposing to seize the user's funds via governance","There is a large liquidation watch on Solana's Solend protocol, where a whale has  deposited 5.7M SOL  ($170M and borrowed 108M USDC and USDT borrowed. This alone accounts for a huge % of borrowing on Solana, and now this position is under a liquidation threat. 

The whale is not closing their position. In most protocols like Compound, or AAVE, Maker etc, this will result in an onchain liquidation. Infact we have seen many such large liquidations on AAVE And Maker recently, and everything has worked as expected. 

However such a large liquidation in an illiquid market and unstable network like Solana is likely to have vastly damaging consequences. Solana network has already gone down and halted half a dozen time. 

The Solend team explains what could happen to the network:

>This  could cause chaos, putting a strain on the Solana network. Liquidators  would be especially active and spamming the liquidate function, which  has been known to be a factor causing Solana to go down in the past.  
>  
>**Letting a liquidation of this size to happen on-chain is extremely risky.**  DEX liquidity isn’t deep enough to handle a sale of this size and could  cause cascading effects. Additionally, liquidators will be incentivized  to spam the network in an effort to win very lucrative liquidations.  This has been known to cause load issues for Solana in the past which  would exacerbate the problems at hand.

So to prevent this, they are proposing to literally steal the user's funds and execute OTC trades:

>Grant  emergency power to Solend Labs to temporarily take over the whale’s  account so the liquidation can be executed OTC and avoid pushing Solana  to its limits. This would be done via a smart contract upgrade.  Emergency powers will be revoked once the whale’s account reaches a safe  level.

When shit starts to implode, all the true colors of decentralization comes out. 

These shitty protocol are run by fly by night cowboys who learnt basics of economics during the bull run. They put their users are risk by running terrible protocols that do not think about all the edge cases...because who cares about risks right?! 

And during signs of distress, they resolve to seize user funds.",11507,2022-06-19 11:17:30,2241

SOL,cryptocurrency,I think Solana is the most over rated crypto and does not deserve a top 5 spot,"Maybe it's just me but I dont see how Solana is so high up the rankings when theres so much controversy around it. The technology is good but aside from that it's an absolute shit coin, another ""ethereum killer"" that will probably die out once the biggest investors sell their bags. 

For starters how can the devs shut down the blockchain because of a glitch then call the platform decentralised? Do you think crypto could of ever come this far if satoshi shut down btc for repairs? Absolute nonsense.

Then there was the discovery of a hidden 12 million coins which wasint disclosed to any investor. 12,000,000× £160 (roughly at the moment)= £1,920,000,000 is a lot of money to hide for no specific reason.

And dont forget the announcement of bringing tether  to their blockchain like that's something to be proud of, everyone in the crypto space knows tether is a liability and could put everyone's investment at risk.

SOL,cryptocurrency,Solana is being wiped out. TVL has crashed to $280m and out of top 10 after losing 67% this month alone. It was close to $1bn at the start of the month. Down 97% from peak,"DeFi on Solana is being wiped out, so to speak. 

At the start of the month, TVL on the chain was close to $1bn. Now it has crashed to $280m and is out of top 10. 

[Top chains by TVL](https://preview.redd.it/0raskafxsy0a1.jpg?width=2756&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16d18b20ac03a626477e0b8a0165746f858f6a07)

At the peak of the bull run, Solana boasted close to $10 BN in TVL. Now it down to 2.8% of that. Absolute carnage.

Solana has been plagued with one disaster after another - first the numerous chain halts, then the revelation that one team was responsible for most of TVL by creating double entries, now the final nail in the coffin has been the implosion of Sam, brining with it the downfall of the chain he shilled so much. Many exchanges are cutting down on exposure to Solana, Even stablecoins are migrating liquidity to other chains

SOL,cryptocurrency,"The $320m Wormhole hack was ""replenished"" by Jump Capital, an institutional trading desk/market maker (similar to Citadel) without any questions. This shows the entire Solana ecosystem is just a sham propped up by institutional entities","Yesterday, the Wormhole bridge one of Solana's biggest bridges lost $320m in a hack. Within hours, a trading desk Jump Capital agreed to replenish the entire amount so that the liquidations calamity is avoided. The loss of the peg due to the hack could have sent the network into cascading liquidations arising out of leveraged positions. In stepped a VC to save the day.

[Lost $320m? Thats fine.. we got you covered. ](https://preview.redd.it/adhsxhuefqf81.jpg?width=1172&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ed759f03c763a7cfd07d8bb35a03cff7aa3921d)

The fact that VCs are ready to cover these kind of losses shows that the entire Solana ""ecosystem"" is just one big sham propped up by these same VCs. They dont want their baby to die just yet. Apparently Jump Capital owns a significant stake in Wormhole and is ready to sink such a huge amount to cover losses. 

In Solana, the top 1.34% of addresses owns 99% of the circulating supply. Most of the supply was sold to early VCs and insiders at a massive discount to retail. Insiders and bad actors like Chamath have publicly joked about using Solana as a vehicle to play their pumps and dumps out, leaving retail to hold the bags when the sham unfolds. 

VCs dont just sink in $300m to save the day, unless they have already taken out 50x that amount - that is what Solana has enabled them to do already.

So a buncha SOL Shills be like hurr durr even ehtirium had hacks and was saved by fork. Well the DAO hack was solved by cryptography solutions (forking), not by VCs stepping into save the day. If you think both are the same, you clearly understand NOTHING about crypto whatsoever. The DAO hack and the hard fork took over a month to assess, propose solutions and resolve. It wasnt an overnight fix, like what solana is known for. 


When Solana goes down - over night fix.

When bridge hacked? - overnight fix. 

How long will Solana depend on overnight fixes to bail the network out?

Edit: The mental gymnastics of SOlshills is just incredible. They have clearly consumed all the kool aid in the world to be supportive of this kind of institution manipulation. Yes, other projects also have VCs, and Eth projects have also been hacked. Yet none of the ETH projects have been bailed out in this manner by VCs and institutions. I have been extremely critical of ETH too. There is virtually a hack a day on Eth due to poor code or implementation or bugs, but none of the ETH project hacks have been ""replenished"" by institutions. If an ETH projects gets hacked and people lose money, well you are shit out of luck. As evidenced by hundreds of hacks and scams before. 

The first major Solana hack, and less than 24 hours later the institutions propping up solana claim they are bailing everyone out. If this is not the least bit suspicious to you, then you are just being slow boiled alive. 

Solana itself is a long term pump and dump that is devoid of any decentralisation and fundamentals except a bunch of whales propping it up. The tokenomics of every single Solana ""ecosystem"" project is puke worthy - from Serum to Raydium, Bonfida, Saber etc all have massive supply in the hands of a few, an incredibly high FDV and a low float and funny unlock mechanisms - perfect conditions for institutions to keep dumping on hapless retail investors like the ones supporting Solana in the comments here who dont understand anything about crypto or finance.",4508,2022-02-04 03:17:30,1352
SOL,cryptocurrency,"Solana went down again on 4th Jan morning (UTC +8) , and was fixed early morning. Now it is back up, but shows how vulnerable this system is. A system that goes down is a death knell for serious traders","Another year.. and another episode of Solana going down.

Today it went down for a few hours in the early morning Asia time, and it took almost 4 hours to bring it back up.

As the meme goes, the D in Solana stands for decentralisation.

A network that goes down this often will never be able to attract serious traders.

Imagine you are trading on margin and get liquidated because the network was down.. this happens in centralised exchanges. Solana now natively brings this kind of user experience to the blockchain where you can experience network failure on the chain. What a wonderful innovation.

Blaming it on attackers is just dishonesty. A well designed blockchain is not supposed to have attackers, its supposed to keep producing blocks based on the parameters of the network, not take a break because someone spammed transactions.

Edit: So Sol shills have attacked this post, here is some more ""proof""

Users are repeatedly questioning the validity of the status dot solana page that shows 100% uptime even when the network was down, and even Coinbase flagged it as down.

This is why you dont use a service's own status page to come to conclusions especially if it masquerades as a decentralised blockchain, but in reality is just a glorified database.

Edit 3: This post is brigaded from the Solana sub. Hundreds of Sol shills are trying to pretend the network wasnt down. Ironically, on Sol sub itself, someone agrees that not only did the network go down, but had to be rebooted too. This is hilarious lol, the network was rebooted but status dot solana shows 100% uptime. Well played, centralised tricksters.

# Solana's TVL problem

Solana contracts return DROPPED errors on *50% to 80%* of all current transactions. You experience them as order delays and frustration. See for yourself at [solanabeach.io](https://solanabeach.io)

The Cause: **Low TVL + fragmented liquidity = Big slippage problems**

On Monday 3/18, SOL Dex Volume totaled $2.8B vs Ethereum's $2.0 Billion. This should be good news. But Solana's low liquidity cannot support the volume.

Poor liquidity creates added volatility and slippage fails. Solana strives to outperform Ethereum, but with only access to the equivalent of 8% of Ethereum's liquidity by contrast.

This liability remains anchored to Solana for at least another year. The unlocks are over and above scheduled inflation. It bears mentioning this 10% is now reduced to 8.2%. Money continues to *leak* from a number of mystery wallets. Still, shaking Alameda next year is a necessary step.

Even still, let's look at Solana Foundation's posted inflation schedule. You'll find that everything they claim must be verified and not taken at face-value.

>***Solana's annual inflation rate is currently 5.515% and will decrease by 15% every year.***

But how do you define a year?

Its necessary to understand Sol Foundation's answer to that stupid question. The annual numbers are based on the length of an epoch-year. An epoch-year isn't 365 days. An epoch-year is 180 epochs.

Rough formula to calculate an epoch-year.

* 1 epoch = 2.5+ days
* 180 epochs = 1 Epoch Year
* 1 Epoch Year spans 450 to 630 Earth days (dependent on the length of each epoch).

Epoch years offer flexible margins to adjust your numbers. So the 5.515% inflation rate is technically accurate. The tech-docs end with the 5 yellow-highlighted words: ***Actual inflation rate will vary.***

Its equally important to consider that inflation is the effective circulating supply. Everything that's out there! But the Solana Foundation only factors new SOL issuance used to pay validators. That's misleading, if not deceptive.

SOL,cryptocurrency,"""Move to Earn"" like STEPN are the latest ponzis. There is no value created in any of this. If we can just move our ass to ""earn"", all of us will be billionaires. Unfortunately, someone will be holding heavy bags in the end. Solana founder promoting this as a ""paradigm shift"" is scummy","Move to earn apps are gaining popularity and many seem to even think all of this is sustainable. A huge number of such apps have just launched out of nowhere. 

Stepn for their part helps further the scam by closely controlling how many invites can be sent out each day, thereby ensuring supply/demand and the ponzi scheme doesnt collapse overnight. However they can only do this for so long. New people buying shoes are paying for early entrants to exit. Some time ago, the cheapest shoe to enter was around $700. At the end of this scheme, many will lose their investments they have put into the scheme. 

It is just similar to bitconnect where new depositors withdrawals were limited (you could only withdraw after some time in the system). If you control the entry and exit parametric of a devious ponzi scheme, you can further the time till it all collapses.

Yes I know Solana has a higher market cap but I feel like in the long term, Polygon will be flipping it.

There is currently about 30-50% loss and an average ping time of 20-40s.

The whole network has been congested for days, and a lot of people are complaining about this in the Solana community.

In addition, there are tons of failed non-vote transactions. I'm estimating around 50-80% of Tx are failing. This is due to all the spam and MEV that's been going on due to excessive meme coin activity on Solana. (If you don't believe me, just pick a random block on [https://solscan.io/blocks](https://solscan.io/blocks) and scroll down past the vote transactions.)

Most of you probably already know that Solana is not a 50k TPS network due to vote transactions. It's just marketing BS and misreporting.

For the longest time, I've suspected that Solana maxes out at 1100-1200 TPS in real life conditions. This is proof that even when the network is full with 30-50s wait times, it does not exceed 1200 True TPS. I've checked this chart dozens of times in the past 2 years during Solana congestion, and highest I've ever seen was 1200 True TPS.

[Today's True TPS is about 900-1100 TPS](https://preview.redd.it/61n4zzaf8soc1.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=a58878c55176e7229e436c8f847312f0e4af355a)

On average, non-vote transactions account for 10-20% of the total transactions. And the daily average of True TPS is about 300-400 TPS. Even during the spike in Dec 2023, it did not exceed 800 TPS.

SOL,cryptocurrency,"Solana is centralized, stoppable and its fundamental design flaws are considered features by SOL guys. Genuine decentralisation and well-designed security make a far more valuable proposition than some big TPS numbers. If you can't run a full-node yourself then it's just another bank.","I'll start with September '21 and the quote from Gavin Wood:

Events of today in crypto just go to show that genuine decentralisation and well-designed security make a far more valuable proposition than some big tps numbers coming from an exclusive and closed set of servers. If you can't run a full-node yourself then it's just another bank.

Fast forward to December '21 and quote from Justin Bons:

Solana was DDoS attacked again. This attack exploited fundamental design flaws which are considered features by SOL.  As it sacrifices decentralization & security for speed while ignoring the consequences of that trade off  specifically Proof of History & Turbine (PoH).

A consequence of PoH is deterministic block creation:  There is a good reason why public blockchains before SoL did not take this route.  Non-deterministic block creation adds to security & censorship resistance as you cannot predict who will create the next block.

Instead in SoL it is possible to predict & therefore attack the next block producers.  For instance attacking the next 100 validators instead of attacking the entire network.  This attack also works regardless of scale, thereby severely reducing SOL security.

SOL security is not just reduced against DDoS attacks since this attack can also be combined with a 51% attack  allowing an attacker to temporarily gain proportional staked control over the network by attacking other large stake holders. These are all consequences of PoH!

Combining Turbine with PoH leads to even more dire consequences:  Turbine divides the transaction memory pool into small groupings of validators.  This means that with PoH you can censor transactions by just attacking the specific validators in that grouping!

This is just one aspect of SOL's design that exposes the bad faith of its creation.  Prioritizing attracting ignorant cryptocurrency investors over good sustainable blockchain design.  There are many examples like this in terms of design as well as lies & fraud, buyer beware

Solana's posted inflation schedule is adrift from reality. The asterisk symbol is its only truthful piece of information. So let's follow it and see where it leads.

[These figures are misleading](https://preview.redd.it/b0c8kozaqrjc1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ef25f0224d7e0ac35e1fc3169cbb11fabc992d9)

# EPOCH YEAR

From Solana Official Docs:  Solana's annual inflation is currently 5.515%. Note that this is an 'epoch-year', or \~ 180 epochs.

Okay now WTF is an epoch-year? An easier explanation than this.

**MEANWHILE ON PLANET SOL**

On Planet Sol, a year spans 180 epochs.  1 epoch = 2.5+ days.  Epoch years range 450 to 630 Earth days.  See for yourself.

[Actual inflation rate will vary](https://preview.redd.it/2t6vibotqrjc1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b0e74de593a8154ad09a9f8500484a683d4a702)

But hold on.  ""Non-stakers pay stakers?"" What's that about? Merits a closer look.

# NON-STAKERS PAY STAKERS

New SOL issue pays Validators. Solana rewards remaining new issue to Stakers.

Problem: New SOL inflates currency and fee burn's insufficient.

Solution: Reward shields Stakers from inflation. Non-Stakers get no reward.  Non-Stakers pay for inflation. They become the yield for Solana stakers.

Non-Stakers Pay Stakers.

# SOL to $1000;CAP to $441 Billion

* $45 Billion market cap must climb to $441 Billion to reach $1000 p/c
* To achieve that, it must capture greater share of DeFi & NFT market
* To have a chance at those markets, Solana can't tip over. Like never again.
* Solana must raise its fees

Solana's current fee structure guarantees it can never compete with Ethereum.

# CLOSED-SOURCE CENTRALIZATION

SOL,cryptocurrency,Solana Labs CEO: It ‘doesn’t really matter’ if the network goes down again / let that sink in what kind of garbage Solana is,"Quick Take

* In September, the Solana blockchain was swamped by transactions and ended up going offline for 17 hours.
* Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko says that this is only a problem for those measuring in milliseconds.

When asked what are the chances the network goes down again, Yakovenko  replied, “I don’t know. It doesn’t really matter, though.”

His argument went as follows: as long as there’s at least one copy of  the ledger, the funds are still safe and the transactions will  eventually get processed. If you don’t care how long a transaction takes  to go through, “then how much do you care that there's a 72 hour  block?” 

Yakovenko likened the downtime to a particularly long wait between  blocks. He claimed that Solana didn’t really go offline, there just  wasn’t a confirmed block for that time period. “So that technically does  look like a 17-hour block if you look at the history.”

Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano have entered the chat for a laugh... C'mon bois, this is the biggest centralized shitshow of the century and it seems that going offline might happen again or frequently!

 I was very enthusiastic about solana and I was on the verge of buying a bag of SOL several times. 

The first time the system went down, I still thought to myself that this was going to be a one-time error. I did lose a lot of faith in the blockchain, but I found the concept of ""proof of history"" very interesting, so I was still interested in the coin. 
This was followed by the large price increase and the necessary hype, which caused the price to rise even more. SOL was quickly in the top 5 cryptos and took over ADA's spot easily. 

Suddenly, in September the system goes down again for several hours. I thought this would be the end of SOL. This was when I was extremely surprised that SOL's price remained stable and even continued to climb quietly. I didn't understand. 

But when the ddos ​​happened and the system was down again recently, I really really thought that SOL was going to plummet (especially in these difficult times full of uncertainty). This STILL didn't happen.

SOL,cryptocurrency,Nearly 450 days after becoming a top 10 crypto Solana has been flipped by Matic and fallen out of the top 10.,"On Aug. 16th 2021, Solana flipped Uniswap (now rank 17) to become a top 10 crypto. Below is an image of the top 10 at the time the flip occurred.

Since then, Solana shot up in value, skyrocketing from $63.86 to over $250 (and becoming the number 4 crypto) just under 3 months later on Nov. 05, 2021. However the 2022 bear market has been particularly hard on SOL as it's currently down \~88% since the ATH. Outage after Outage over the last year has caused this novel Proof of History blockchain to bleed out its market cap.  

Now just 448 days after becoming a top 10 crypto SOL has officially been flipped by MATIC and fallen out of the top 10. How long the flip lasts is another question, but for now SOL is out of the top 10.

SOL,cryptocurrency,"Solana (SOL) is the next EOS. It's just another ""super node"" project where it takes a supercomputer to run a node and there is too much trust on solona the company.","**sorry for the re-post,  spelled solana wrong in the title and people couldn't get past that.**

So there was so much hype around EOS how it did a bazillion TPS and was gonna overthrow ETH and all that.  Now its a ghost chain and the company that started it has like 200k in BTC and prolly that much in ETH.  Solana is hyped so much, but really the reason why it can do so many TPS and what not is because it takes a fucking supercomputer to run a node, and the project is centralized.    Please read this blog about what it takes to run a solona node:  [https://blog.lopp.net/2021-altcoin-node-sync-tests/](https://blog.lopp.net/2021-altcoin-node-sync-tests/) Some takeaways from the post:

>it takes a computer with AT LEAST 128gb of RAM to run a node (they recommend 256gb of RAM,  not disk space,  RAM)  
>  
>you have to get data from trusted validators, and All four --trusted-validators are operated by Solana (like you can't do what you need to do to verify, you have to trust)  
>  
>Solana is most likely running those trusted validators on google cloud

Do your own research on this new coin.  **For me, if the average person can't run a node,  its not decentralized.**

EDIT:  I shopped around and if you want to get a computer to run a solana node, you will need to invest 5k to 10k USD.  Here are the specs: Hardware Recommendations#

    CPU
        12 cores / 24 threads, or more
        2.8GHz, or faster
        AVX2 instruction support (to use official release binaries, self-compile otherwise)
        Support for AVX512f and/or SHA-NI instructions is helpful
        The AMD Threadripper Zen3 series is popular with the validator community
    RAM
        128GB, or more
        Motherboard with 256GB capacity suggested
    Disk
        PCIe Gen3 x4 NVME SSD, or better
        Accounts: 500GB, or larger. High TBW (Total Bytes Written)
        Ledger: 1TB or larger. High TBW suggested
        OS: (Optional) 500GB, or larger. SATA OK
        The OS may be installed on the ledger disk, though testing has shown better performance with the ledger on its own disk
        Accounts and ledger can be stored on the same disk, however due to high IOPS, this is not recommended
        The Samsung 970 and 980 Pro series SSDs are popular with the validator community
    GPUs
        Not strictly necessary at this time
        Motherboard and power supply speced to add one or more high-end GPUs in the future suggested

>**Solana Developers Say Reason for Network Outage Still Unclear**  
“At approximately 05:46:16 UTC 2023-02-25, Solana Mainnet Beta suffered a significant performance degradation,” the developers said. “Eventually leading the validator community to opt for a restart of the network. The cause of this is still unknown and under active investigation.”  
“Root cause is still unknown and under active investigation,” developers added.  
The problems that started as sluggish transaction processing spiraled into a near complete shutdown of activity on Solana, validators and developers told CoinDesk over the weekend.

And what about that Mainnet **Beta?** Yes, you heard right, it's still only in Beta, even though they said over 2 years ago that it's ready for prime time, but they'd keep the '**Beta**' tag for a year or so:

>Mainnet is launched! It was launched in March and is successfully working. For your understanding - Yes, we were first calling it beta because it was just launched and not every function was available.  
***We will keep the suffix ""beta"" for a year or so because we want to check the mainnet stability in the long term and make sure we have a great product.*** But it's a working network - partners work on this network, Serum DEX running on this blockchain, KIN moves it's users to this network and that is exactly the blockchain the Solana Accelerator team winners use to build on.

SOL,cryptocurrency,"Algorand now has > 10x the smart contract throughput than Solana and any other top L1 (SOL, BSC, AVAX, MATIC, CELO, ETH included)","I think we can all agree that tps numbers can be hard to compare between chains. Some chains can pin 10000s of native token transfers, but things get weird when you start to compare smart contracts.

Last year, I posted about [this metric](https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/the-amm-test-a-no-bs-look-at-l1-performance-4c8c2129d581) in the Algorand subreddits for determining throughput of different blockchains in the ***fairest*** way possible. That is using an AMM “uniswap-style” swap as the benchmark.

The authors of the medium article linked in my original post tested the smart contract throughput of some of the top smart contract platforms *empirically*, and they found that these chains to have the following AMM-swap tps limits:

* Solana Mainnet Orca - 273 swaps
* BSC pancakeswap - 195 swaps
* Polygon quickswap - 95 swaps
* Avax Trader Joe - 176 swaps
* Celo Ubeswap - 50 swaps
* Ethereum uniswap v2 - 18 swaps

Immediately after the 6k tps upgrade, I made a post about Algorand's ability to perform these AMM-style swaps which was *estimated* using the assumption that an AMM swap would require four txns per swap. This estimation came out to about 1625 swaps per second. At the time this was very impressive because the next fastest chain was Solana capped at being able to do 273 swaps per second.

People foreshadowed in the comments on one of my previous posts saying that it could definitely be done in less than four transactions, but I wanted to be conservative at the time.

Today, I saw on twitter that one of the developers from Vestige actually [**empirically tested** this on the MAINNET](https://twitter.com/vestigefi/status/1612411850158637056) and proved that **Algorand can do 2881 AMM-style swaps per second.** You can see the on-chain evidence in [this block](https://algoexplorer.io/block/26101804). 

[Algorand literally dwarfs these other chains in smart contract efficiency](https://preview.redd.it/ds1vjukn75ba1.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4344c5944148c3545297725b6e543ea821cdb52)

* 10.5x more than Solana Mainnet Orca - 273 swaps
* 15x more than BSC pancakeswap - 195 swaps
* 30x more than Polygon quickswap - 95 swaps
* 16x more than Avax Trader Joe - 176 swaps
* 57x more than Celo Ubeswap - 50 swaps
* 160x more than Ethereum uniswap v2 - 18 swaps
* **3.5x more than all of them combined - 807 swaps**

If anybody can do this experiment for other popular Layer 1s like Tezos, NEAR, or Elrond or the Layer 2s on ETH, I would love to include them here.

After the developers had to shutdown the network to fix the bug, the FUD around Solana was enormous! There were dozens of posts in this subreddit claiming that SOL is about to die and that its run was over!

However now after a few red days, SOL is almost 15% up since yesterday. There are many upcoming conferences. Whales are jumping in. Companies are building on Solana because it is fast and cheap. According to most predictions SOL is about to reach $250 soon (not a financial advice though).

In my opinion all that shows that people put profits over decentralization (suprise! /s). Most people would probably even betray their values just to make some quick money!",910,2021-09-18 17:07:39,564
SOL,cryptocurrency,10 things they don't want people to know or post about about Solana (part deux),"1. **75.72%** of all transactions through Jupiter are failing. 

2. **48.71%** of all transactions through Raydium are failing. 

3. Transactions will fail for a **variety of reasons** not just slippage issues. 

4. Voting consensus transactions & failed transactions massively bloat the blockchain size, **currently \~265 TB & growing fast.** 

5. Again, **TPS includes voting consensus and failed transactions**, failed transactions on most other blockchains are strictly validated before even hitting the blockchain. 

6. **Firedancer** is live on mainnet, but in 'non-voting mode' which means it cannot produce blocks and is **only doing about \~30% of what a validator does.** 

7. **RPC endpoint architecture allows operators to reorder transactions and front-run.** 

8. ***$7.5 billion SOL, is continued to be sold-off by FTX, a major unlock occurs in March 2025, and continued unlocks every month up till 2028.*** (Repeated due to importance). 

9. **5 million daily active users is a myth, 4.5 million of these hold 0 SOL, and much more hold < 1, they are created with an intention to inflate metrics,** notice the large uptick in August, also 1 user(bot) could technically have 4 million wallets. 

10. **The Top 18 validators control +33% of the entire staked Solana supply, meaning they can collaboratively block consensus and censor transactions.**

TL;DR: I added a comedy flair for ""comedy"" purposes because if someone told you that this is one of the major crypto networks you'd indeed think that crypto is a scam...

SOL,cryptocurrency,The Total Value of assets Locked (TVL) in Solana has decreased from $10B all the way down to $250M now. Truly a fall from grace.,"I do not intend to sprinkle more fear into Solana right now, especially as I am also a holder of it, but the rise and fall of Solana is truly one for the history books. Back in 2021 SOL was seen as the next big thing and was even realistically seen as an “ETH killer“. SOL even had a parabolic rise right in the middle of BTC collapsing due to China FUD in May 2021.

But once the bear market came, just like everyone else Solane also had to collapse and that from a price of $250 to now just $18, truly a massive price crash, but this is not the only thing that went down:

TVL, Total Value Locked, shows the total value of all the assets that are on a network. It is often used as a metric to gauge the legitimacy of a Crypto. Here we can see an even worse collapse, from over $10B to now just $250M and we obviously can not forget the upcoming FTX liquidations that will likely happen over the years.

So yeah, I don't want to provoke people to sell all their SOL, but as much as we joke about it, in Crypto anything is possible we have already seen the craziest comebacks with BTC itself. So stay resilient and make sure to keep an eye out for latest news.",332,2023-09-16 16:43:18,376

If all the meme coins go to solana that means the Ethereum network is more free and fees go down, all the useless coins stop congesting the network as much. They dont really add value to anything anyway other than pump and dumps.

As the ETFs go live this opens the door for the tokenization of assets(stocks, bonds, real estate, etc) to begin on Ethereum. Ethereum gets all the real life good securities on the network and Solana gets all the useless celebrity scams.

If you didn't know, SBF was a very vocal proponent of Solana. He actually went as far as to call Solana literally 'the most underrated token'. Alameda Reearch, a trading firm owned by SBF held around ***10% of the circulating supply*** of SOL in its accounts. A quick rehash of Solana's issues are the very heavy investment and control that VC firms have over Solana as well as their many network outages and heavy centralization.

Alameda Research is now bankrupt and these tokens that they held may be sold off to pay back creditors. Additionally, these are many questions regarding the viability and value of the SOL token as another token that made up a large portion of Alameda's balance sheet, FTT, is mired in scandal as it is very likely to have been used as a tool in very ponzi-like business operations, with Alameda and FTX effectively printing money out of thin air. All of this yields heavy downward pressure on the price of SOL.

 Additionally on 10th Nov Solana was meant to release/unstake a full 63 million SOL to the market as their lock-up/stake period had ended. This amounted to around 10% of supply. This unlock of 28.5 million SOL *by the Solana Foundation* was postponed due the the FTX/Alameda collapse and would released two days later. Thus the market was looking at a *potential* iselling of 20% of supply plus whatever SOL holders simply lost faith and decided to sell. All these things did not bode well for it's price.",586,2022-11-14 12:22:45,367
SOL,cryptocurrency,Solana proposal simd96 stealing 50% priority burn fees from users to pay themselves being voted in by themsleves update...,"I gave the information for the discussion period here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/s/6DRhfckb9t

The proposal is here:
https://forum.solana.com/t/proposal-for-enabling-the-reward-full-priority-fee-to-validator-on-solana-mainnet-beta/1456

The voting has started and you can find the validators voting in support of this here:
https://solscan.io/account/YESsimd96Cuw3M5TYAkZ1d71ug4bvVHiqHhhJzsFHHQ#splTransfers

At today's current prices the users of Solana can expect nearly $1,000,000 USD a day of increased emissions/inflation. If congestion occurs, traffic picks up, or Solana price increase these values will exponentially grow.

The key takeway besides the changing of monetary policy the validators are voting for themselves, there is an exposed risk with having 0% burn fee where the validators will collude to stuff blocks with worthless transactions or copy pasta dozen of ore scripts to manipulate priority fees for profit with no risk.

Just thought people should be aware of this high level centralization and what a lot to consider theft and a bait and switch to steal from investors after traffic and priority fees increased to nearly 90% of all fees on Solana. The level of greed from these validators should be shunned by every solana holder. I hope everyone enjoys the new inflation and devalue of their holdings once this closes.

SOL,cryptocurrency,What's up with Solana meme coins? ,"It seems like completely random meme coins on Solana have been popping up out of nowhere and going 10-1000x in a really short period of time.

I did a bit of digging and found out on Dexscreener that there are quite a lot of really small coins on Solana and they are created every day. Most of them obviously have no real value and they look like pump and dump schemes. It's really the closest thing to a casino I've seen in the cryptocurrency space. 

It's understandable that most of these coins end up nowhere, but how do some of them explode to such a high degree? Like one of the largest coins Dogwifhat WIF which went from 0.0001 to 2.5 dollars. And Book of Meme (BOEM) is the latest trending one, it skyrocketed straight after its release. These coins have such random names, they don't even associate with anything trending (at least on a large scale) so it's hard to pinpoint what exactly is driving the price action for these coins. Could it be some kind of an inside job? Has anyone done a deeper research about this topic?

SOL,cryptocurrency,"PSA: Solana does not actually do 4k TPS, it inflates its numbers","While most crypto would say transactions per second are just that, tranactions per second, Solana includes communications between validators as ""transactions"".

[Solana \\""transactions\\"" per second](https://preview.redd.it/f5juclbz2wka1.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1d75da0218ae50d2c4bebfc291861681cb6323d4)

400 TPS is nothing to scoff at, but a long way from the huge TPS claims.

Validators need to communicate to get to consensus. This is true in every chain. Sent a TX? Everyone needs to know. Minted an NFT? Everyone needs to know. However, most chains don't claim this as TPS.

And before you say Solana is public about this, their official explorer on their own website literally just shows the broad TPS.

SOL,cryptocurrency,L2 scaling solutions Arbitrum and Optimism have both flipped Solana in TVL. One without even a native token. L2s are here and scaling DeFi,"Arbitrum and Optimism have both already flipped Solana in terms of TVL.

[TVL of top 10 chains. Source: DefiLlama](https://preview.redd.it/5nv1fx5bdhx91.jpg?width=2764&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=810b3ae59201d0d5e36332877f316477af17efc0)

As of now, Solana's TVL has dropped below $1bn and has lost 22% of its TVL in the last month, in a major blow to the project.

And Arbitrum doesnt even have a native token (yet!). But it has already leapfrogged Solana both in terms of TVL and also in number of projects deployed on the network. Having a native token means a portion of the token's supply is deployed in various DeFi protocols, thereby increasing the chain's TVL. This is the case with Solana, where Solana's native token SOL is deployed into various Liquid staking protocols, CDPs, DEX LPs and lending pools, thereby increasing the TVL on Solana network. Arbitrum doesn't even have a token, yet has amassed over $1bn in real TVL.

Another interesting fact is that now 9 of the top 10 chains are all EVM compatible chains. Solana is the only one that is a non-EVM chain.

Edit: 

Currently Arbitrum is  quite centralized. L2s use sequencers and validators to generate fraud proofs, and currently the Arbitrum team operates these and therefore the L2 is quite centralized.

[https://l2beat.com/scaling/risk/](https://l2beat.com/scaling/risk/) \- you can click over the yellow box to see the security assumption risks under which L2s are currently operating. Right now, all the L2s are centralized to various degrees. 

The technology to decentralize sequencers is still being developed. It is around 12-24 months away. No one really thought that L2s would be big in 2022 itself, and Zk-rollups are also almost nearing mainnet launch. The initial belief was zk-rollups wouldn't be live till 2025. Tech in this space moves very fast 

Launching a token helps decentalize the network. The base layer gas token cannot be used to decentralize a L2 rollup that is built on top of the base layer, or govern the L2 network.

It seems as though the burn-mechanism isn't working so great on SOL, it has over 13.5% YTD inflation.

When you take into consideration that most of the transactions on SOL are failed or consensus transactions it doesn't paint a great picture.

If you factor in team and VC unlocks the inflation is more like \~20%.

These are the common mantras often spruiked by members here. 

What many fail to realise is the significant progress that has been made by the developers on the Solana blockchain in recent months. 

**So why does Solana seem to get congested?**

In the past, when Solana experiences a larger than normal number of transaction requests, it slows down. Ethereum alleviates this issue, by raising the price of its gas fees. However, Solana does not, the fees remain the same, so the network becomes congested. 

In some cases, the network becomes so congested, that transactions get interrupted or stalled, and the network goes offline. Stalls. It then needs to be restarted from the previous block by the validators.

**What has changed?**

Among the many improvements, the Google-supported QUIC protocol was implemented and stress testing has been underway for some time now. Validators have also been working hard to upgrade to the latest software to bring them all in line. 

This was especially more difficult as another change made was also the number of validators is almost at 2000. Coincidentally, this has led to a vastly improved Nakamoto Coefficient of 32. Higher than most of its competitors.    

[Stress tests using the QUIC protocol](https://preview.redd.it/mh38egrds6m91.jpg?width=2292&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f2f2c7520121cce9e347dac591efad8f4aa634)

These tests have shown that the network is able to handle over 14000 transactions per second. For reference, most other major blockchains process less than 1000 transactions per second.

The average TPS rate on Solana [usually hovers](https://solana.com/) around \~3000  

&#x200B;

**So why was today special?**

NFT Mints. 

I'm not fond of NFTs, but I can't deny their success on the Solana chain. A much hyped token mint called Y00ts, was launched today. This brought a massive influx of speculators and NFT collectors to the Solana chain simultaneously in the hope of snagging one. 

&#x200B;

[TPS during the NFT mint - steady and stable](https://preview.redd.it/t0ci3sluu6m91.jpg?width=2246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94f72d1e21fbc5aa9015a99f6f4dab4f62d0b80b)

&#x200B;

Despite the obvious stresses, and past experiences, the chain did not stop, halt, slow down at all. The fact that nothing happened whatsoever, is undeniable evidence that the changes being made by the Solana developers are working.

They were a massive part of its ecosystem and significantly contributed to its rise; listed the Solana token on its front page, would often be the first exchange to list Solana-based projects, would often be an early investor of these projects, helped build the first DEX on Solana (Serum) and also had it on the front page (as one of only 4 tokens alongside SOL, ETH and BTC), would shill Solana relentlessly on Twitter, etc.

So it's no surprise that Solana took a massive beating as the FTX mess unfolded. What do you think happens to Solana now? They recently partnered with Google Cloud, had Instagram support Solana NFT's, will soon launch a Solana-based ""Web 3 Phone,"" is one of the largest blockchains in terms of projects built on it, has a massive NFT community, etc. Will it survive without FTX or will it slowly fade away into irrelevance?

This is because Solana is a non-BFT replication library. It implicitly assumes that the leader is correct.

SOL,cryptocurrency,A word of caution about Solana (SOL),"I just wanted to remind everyone that SOL suffered a DOS attack back in September, only less than 2 months ago. One of the main criticisms at the time was that they just shut down the network, showing how centralized their project was.

Now, it's at an ATH, with no slowdown in sight. 

Just because a coin is rising doesn't mean it's necessarily a good project. Yes, it could eventually make a case to be a competitor to ETH. But there are still a lot of risks along the way.

Just to give a small history lesson. Last bull run, do you guys remember the project TRON (TRX)? Led by Justin Sun (who r/cc seems to hate), they were in the top 10 coins by market cap during the last bull run. People made money! But now? They're #29, and the project hasn't really gone anywhere.

I'm not saying SOL will follow this path exactly, but just wanted to warn everyone that there are definitely risks with this project, and taking profits on it is never a bad idea.",443,2021-11-04 03:12:22,486

SOL,cryptocurrency,I see Solana getting some flack here in r/cc and Algo getting lots of love. Curious why that is?,"As you can maybe tell, i'm fairly new here so excuse me if my etiquette is a bit lacking.  I have been seeing a lot of good things posted in this sub about ALGO and upon looking into it i was reminded of another project that piques my interest, Solana. Which i see doesn't get as much love in this sub.  Base level question: *why is that!?* So i wanted to look for myself and see whats obvi to a novice crypto investor like myself, as well as get your feedback on the major differences of the 2 chains.

**Total Nodes:**

Algo: ***As of November 2021, there is approximately 120 relay nodes.***

Solana: ***200 nodes (Solana is touted to support 50,000 transactions per second (TPS) with over 200 nodes on testnets, making it one of the world's fastest decentralized networks)*** ((can anyone verify this claim?))

**Market Cap:**

Algo: 6.4b

Solana: 31.5b

Ok so a bit bigger SOL cap

**Governance/Staking:**

Algo: *Rewards on every wallet, some as high as 7.2% APY (Atomic); A governance vote is open for the next 2o some odd days*

Solana: *Using liquidity pools to gain rewards (like Jet Protocol (still havent DY(MY)OR enough on this, but at first glance..) Looks like governance and staking isnt as fluid and avaialble?*

Both seems really fast and efficient, Algo definitely touts the ""carbon neutral"" quite a bit more, dont see that from Solana but they seem equally energy intensive as well?  Ive been making some transactions on both for some time now and see similarities in gas fees, Tx's are super quick and cheap (on both) and are super interesting to me especially if high gas fee's are reduced to fractions of a penny.  Another plus for Solana is that it has a pretty big NFT world it contains too

Solana has seen a much greater ATH ($260 USD)

SOL,cryptocurrency,Another Solana analysis: How does Solana pay for its low fees?,"^(Disclaimer: I'm not saying it's the only project with these attributes, and I'm not advocating against it. However, everyone should be aware of criticism and look outside their bubble. Always draw your own conclusions.)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1. The crypto trilemma**

https://preview.redd.it/9tipaty14a1c1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f213b91f6b66bacc9de7b3a16ba6395aaea59e2

Long story short, you have to pay validators and stakers to provide security. But there are two ways: 1) pay with fresh coins **2) pay with fees**. Solana can't do the second one because the fees on L1 must be low (which is the main argument for Solana). There is no way to pay 0.2 cents for a transaction and still maintain a huge network of validators and provide staking with a reasonable APY.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**2. The inflation problem**

This chart explains how Solana can stay so cheap while still paying all the validators and stake pools:

https://i.redd.it/h76bnqyd4a1c1.gif

61% inflation in circulating supply since the beginning of 2021, or in average **18% per year** (source: [messari.io](https://messari.io/project/solana/charts/supply)). The offical site says: ""*Solana's initial inflation rate is 8% annually, decreasing by 15%  year-over-year, reaching a long-term fixed inflation rate of 1.5%  annually*.""

This is also interesting: ""*A fixed proportion (initially 50%) of each transaction fee is burned (destroyed), with the remaining going to the current leader processing the transaction.*"" (source: [docs.solana.com](https://docs.solana.com/de/transaction_fees))

This appears to be scheme to make people think that there is some sort of deflationary context, when in fact there isn't. Fees are being paid for indirectly by investors who hope that the price will go up anyway. It's a gamble on the future and that there will be enough new investors coming in.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**3. What problems will the future bring?**

If inflation is lowered, stakers and validators will receive less reward. The only way to solve this problem is with higher fees or a higher price (which is what investors obviously hope for). A higher price would automatically lead to higher fees.

Again, I'm not advocating against buying Solana. As long as you're just looking for a quick buck, so be it.

SOL,cryptocurrency,Why Solana Metrics are Disingenuous,"Solana prominently features its supposed high transaction volume, low block time, and low transaction costs on its website and has aggressively marketed on that basis. Unfortunately, none of the metrics hold up to scrutiny.

* First, consensus voting is included in the transaction count (I don't think anyone else does this) and comprises the majority of all transactions on the network.

* Second, it's true that Solana’s block time is fast, but this is very different from transaction finality. It usually takes several blocks before the transaction is included in a block and committed to consensus state.

* The cornerstone technical innovation of Solana, Proof of History, addresses a problem that other DLTs don't even have to begin with. Namely, blocks must be produced serially, so Proof of History introduces a verifiable delay to synchronize the timing of block production.

* Solana makes a further security tradeoff in order to achieve low latency. Not only does it have a leader, but the leader is also known in advance! This makes it uniquely susceptible to denial of service.

* Finally, the low transaction fee advertised by Solana is a gimmick. It doesn't cover the real cost of operating the network and must be subsidized by inflationary staking rewards.

I should also mention that blockchains are leader-based networks. The leader (block producer) gets to decide which transactions are included and in what order. This lack of fairness is a huge problem for decentralized exchanges, which is Solana's target market and biggest use case.",417,2021-09-08 08:19:43,416

Now I’ll press ahead.

Yeah it’s fast and cheap since it boasts what might be the highest TPS in the market.  But what use is this ultra high TPS if half of the time I can’t even use the network cause of its awful downtime?

Even their own freaking CEO notoriously said “it doesn’t matter if the network crashes”

If the CEO of a platform or service doesn’t trust its performance, then why tf should I trust it? It just makes no sense how this coin is still at number 6 in rank.

Sure, almost every chain on the market has suffered from downtime here and there but never to the extent that Solana did.

I would much rather stay where I am on Polygon right now. Transactions are just as fast and even cheaper and their ecosystem is WAY more superior with recent news about more than 19k dApps build on top of it.
But most importantly, its way more reliable.

And its not just Polygon. I just mentioned it cause its the platform I use the most. Literally any other platform right now is more reliable than Solana.",324,2022-04-30 21:44:41,361

SOL,cryptocurrency,Solana TVL drops 98% from ATH,"**What is TVL and why is it important?**

TVL represents the total value of cryptocurrency that is “locked”, or stored, in a DeFi application or smart contract. For most DeFi platforms, especially those related to lending or swaps, TVL is an important metric as it can directly affect the yields and usability of these applications for end users. For these applications in general, the higher the TVL, the better, as swaps will be more efficient and lending markets can more effectively supply liquidity to borrowers.

**What does high TVL indicate ?**

TVL can be thought of as a measure of liquidity and usability of a chain. It can’t be treated as a standalone metric like everything else but gives a directional sense. Higher TVL indicates it's activity against competitors .

**Solana's TVL trend**

[https://imgur.com/a/kZF1toc](https://imgur.com/a/kZF1toc)

FTM in comparison has a TVL of 412 million, even Kava which is barely in top 100 by mcap has a TVL of 175 million.

Does it rightly indicate the reduced activity of solana and an imminent downfall? What other metrics should be looked for comparison?

SOL,cryptocurrency,Serious.

(Feel free to correct me otherwise).

In comparison, other top chains Ethereum, Binance, etc. have seen numerous outages this year alone.

Putting outages aside, Solana seems to be hellbent on dominating distribution via strategic partnerships with the likes of Shopify. I'm actually pretty bullish on this one and have voiced the positive impact of this partnership on Reddit. I mean, looking at the numbers that is quite the catalyst we’ve been looking for, no?

As a distribution asset, Shopify has insane global impact, over 4.3 million active stores, and 10% of the global ecommerce platform market. They have nothing to benefit from a pump and dump type conspiracy with Solana, which gives me a bit of hope.

SOL,cryptocurrency,Ethereum just hit a brand new 3.5 year low against Bitcoin. ,"ETH just hit a brand new 3 and a half year low against BTC after touching .03462 beating it's last 3 and a half year low of .03465 set just 8 days ago on Nov. 06th 2024. (.03462 means 1 eth is worth 3.46% of 1 BTC. )

In fact this means ETH has wiped all out gains against BTC since April 2021 when ETH was \~2k and BTC was around \~$60k. Since then ETH has completed the merge moving it from POW to POS and Proto-Danksharding (which dropped the gas cost on L2s). Still in comparing it's value against BTC, ETH has officially lost all of it's bear market gains.

SOL,cryptocurrency,The 'Solana Killer' Aptos is looking very suspicious. Be wary.,"Welcome to the land of 'Solana Killers.' Here you have Bitgert, Solana (lol), and Aptos.

Aptos claims to be a next-generation L0 Omni-chain (like Cosmos) that will crush Solana in terms of tx speed and network resilience. And while network resilience isn't a difficult thing to beat Solana in, they started with 102 validators (of which none are community-run and all are monitored by Aptos Labs) and the community only has access to 51% of all tokens, which will be unlocked slower than the early investors and the Foundation/Labs.

[Distribution Schedule - moshaikhs on Twitter](https://preview.redd.it/hjqoxymz6ou91.png?width=2442&format=png&auto=webp&s=96cced19cef7bd356a8e65ea745c29683fe32507)

Aptos has not disclosed the original price early investors paid for each APT token in early funding. Their distribution chart is also heavily flawed and lacks current data and is instead based on estimates of how the community will stake their APT.

[Image from https:\/\/nitter.net\/BenjaminSinger8\/status\/1582294078796226560\/photo\/2](https://preview.redd.it/llo9kme17ou91.png?width=1065&format=png&auto=webp&s=4431aa5088ce7c0070412e1b5077bc082642c314)

*Why does the Aptos tokenomics breakdown not include the ""staking rewards"" as its component when the chart clearly does? Is the ""remaining 1/120"" unlocking every month coming from community or from staking rewards? This is not a thorough breakdown imo. Please try again.*

FTX, Binance, and Coinbase are listing APT tomorrow and already clearly own it, but are marketing APT as though they were sold to them by the community. This is impossible as there was no ICO/crowd sale. And while Aptos claims to have a theoretical 160,000 TPS, Aptos' current TPS is about 24 according to their [explorer](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/). Their 102 validators can very quickly take over the network as there are a few validators that hold over 66% of the stake. 

Aptos Labs was created by former Diem (Meta/Facebook crypto project) employees and is pretty much a renamed Diem network, as its tech is mostly based on Diem. Aptos Labs was hit with a [lawsuit](https://thecoin.news/articles/aptos-ceo-faces-lawsuit-glazer-family-member-equity-1653060104579) in May claiming Aptos' co-CEO Mo Shaikh deprived a partner of their rightful share.

It is absurd how easy it is to manipulate the market and the community to invest in Sol. through false metrics & attract ""investors"" who believe in it. A long, thought-provoking thread...","Solana isn't as popular as it seems. **Through false metrics, it attracted investors who believed in an inflated and fake activity.**  A long, thought-provoking thread...

Solana saw an explosive growth in the last bull-run.  Among the reasons were low fees, low block time.  But today we will talk about other key reasons: **fake TPS, fake DAU,  fake TVL • fake decentralization • fake supply • Dirty money** 

[FAKE TPS](https://twitter.com/Davyegld/status/1653070947635560449/photo/1)

Let's start with the famous part, and then go into the ""unknown"" ones.  For a long time, **Solana has been shilled by influencers for its high number of fake transactions per second.**  Why? You decide.  [@solana](https://twitter.com/solana)  main explorer doesn't show real TPS.  Why? You decide.

A large portion of txs comes directly from consensus txs, a design choice.  High transactions has nothing to do with usage.  Doing some easy calculations on Solana compass, we can see that: • On av. 4k TPS • **90% are vote txs • Only 10% are real txs**  4k tps? [Only 400 real tps!](https://twitter.com/Davyegld/status/1653070950135463938/photo/1)

Wait! But 400 tps is still an incredible metric! Yes... but no. Let's start skimming this number to arrive at a more truthful one.  First data to bear in mind: Failed transactions 📷  Around 13% of Solana txs are failed txs, but are counted in the tps.  [400 - 13% = 348tps](https://twitter.com/Davyegld/status/1653070952387715074/photo/1)

 Oh and about them, I wasn't able to determine how many of them are counted in the tps on the explorer. Not sure.   I counted all of them anyway. Sol did too for some outages, stating they were able to ""handle"" 400k txs... [you wish!](https://twitter.com/Justin_Bons/status/1576984070114144257)

 We now have to acknowledge another thing.  Due to Solana design and low fees, lot of bots sign txs on the chain.  But how many? **Up to 98% of transactions are made by bots.**  348 - 98% = 7tps made by humans  Here's some on [old chain analysis](https://twitter.com/Davyegld/status/1653070957014052865/photo/1) made by [@runkellen](https://twitter.com/runkellen) on [@flipsidecrypto](https://twitter.com/flipsidecrypto)

 All blockchains have bots. But [Solana has more... way more.](https://twitter.com/SolBulletin/status/1647713375164538885) Amount of daily txs per active address(16/04): [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&src=cashtag_click): 6.6 [$AVAX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AVAX&src=cashtag_click): 15.7 [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click): 2.8 [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click): 7.7 [$NEAR](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24NEAR&src=cashtag_click): 6.5 [$EGLD](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24EGLD&src=cashtag_click): 14.5 [$BNB](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BNB&src=cashtag_click): 3.1  And [$SOL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click):117 Or 7.5x times of the highest.

**117 txs per active wallet would mean that the average user on Solana should do on AVERAGE: • 117 txs per day • 3500 per month • 42700 per year  A clear and simple proof of how easy it is to see that SOL is full of bots.** 

 Let's say **we want to calculate how many txs would be made if SOL had normal txs per address**.  The average for the chains considered is 8txs.  On 16/04 SOL had 226k DAU [@nansen\_ai](https://twitter.com/nansen_ai)  
 .  226k \* 8 = 1.8mln daily txs  **That equals to 21 tps,** or 41 with [$AVAX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AVAX&src=cashtag_click) numbers.  **10/20 times lower!**

FAKE DAU  

How many are real? Data from Nansen:  286k Daily active accounts: • 213k wallets • 14,7k token accounts • 57,9k program accounts  20% of all daily active accounts are programs. 

[FAKE TVL](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/08/05/the-fake-team-that-made-solana-defi-look-huge/)

It's well documented but worth mentioning.  It helped SOL to increase in value during the bull-market and his defi look way better than it was.  **Out of 10.5B TVL, 7.5B were FAKE! 70% of the TVL was fake**.  Why didn't Sol team notice? You decide. 

FAKE DECENTRALIZATION 

 A network can be considered decentralized when no single entity can control it.  Now, a big problem of Solana is relying on vertical scalability.  What does it mean?  **Solana nodes are extremely expensive.** 

You can look at docs for recommended hardware but keep in mind that big validators run on 10gps and not 1 + have dedicated GPUs = even higher costs.  + No minimum stake for validators, that has to pay to partecipate in consensus each epoch.  3 SOL every 2-3 days: 22$ per day now 

 These enormous costs lead to a consequence: [70% validators aren't profitable.](https://twitter.com/Davyegld/status/1653070991772340226/photo/1)  What? Why do they run nodes then?  Simply... Cause **Sol foundation gives them money to stay profitable. Without his help it'd have way less validators.** 

 Some (still a low number) stake with Jito client and similar, that provides **absurdly low costs for nodes**.   How? Simply, **they plan to profit from MEV attacks**: **auctioning block space to searchers that front-run users reordering blocks.  Real decentralization?** You decide.

Supply and FTX  

Let's start with an interesting lie about Sol supply, an old 2020 story.  Solana team lied to the community about his circulating supply.  Circulating supply: • Official: 8.5 mln • Real: 20 mln 

[2020 and 2021 were two incredible years for the Solana foundation!](https://twitter.com/Davyegld/status/1653071006334869505/photo/1)They found a really generous investor that had a famous investing firm, sir [@SBF\_FTX](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX).  T**hey raised 58mln$ that helped Solana boost his ecosystem.  Problem? It was later discovered that these generous investments were made by Alameda with money from FTX depositors.  Sam was basically a Solana team member, how didn't they notice? You decide.  As always, the team had no idea of the situation.** 

**TL;DR:**  Every chain has been dirty in some way, some more, some less.  But it is amazing how much of the dirt is on Solana.  Add hacks, downtime, resets, unauthorized unstake, lobbying.  It is absurd how easy it is to manipulate the market and the community to invest in Sol.

SOL,cryptocurrency,Where did all the Solana supporters go?,"Feel as though the support fell off a cliff went from about a hundred to zero. Funny how quickly people lose interest. Also how fast this subreddits sentiment changes one moment you are getting downvoted about trying to point out the problems with Solana then the next you are being upvoted. Just goes to show most people have no idea what they are doing and will just bandwagon with the current popular sentiment. 

Also how far people on this subreddit will go to protect their precious coins that can never be criticised. I had multiple Solana lovers follow my comments downvoting them or replying to the comments with me stating the fact that Solana has gone down in the past before and it’s only a matter of time again. Even after the recent outage it had they would follow me saying I was spreading misinformation about it going down in the past even though I was citing sources from Solana themselves. But at that point the subreddit sentiment had begun to change and they were being downvoted now and their precious egos couldn’t handle it and they deleted all their comments. 

A lot of people on this subreddit treat their investments like sports teams and they cannot handle any criticisms to their coins. Hence why you shouldn’t listen to what is trending here, any criticism will be downvoted and only the positives will be upvoted. Always do your own research.",196,2021-10-01 02:36:20,311
SOL,cryptocurrency,"Solana applied to be the blockchain for Reddit Community Points, would there be greater growth with Solana?","Reddit hosted the [Reddit Great Scaling Bake-Off](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/) to determine what chain to host Reddit Community Points on.

**Arbitrum Nova was the winner**

I think the Arbitrum Nova pick was a good pick for the blockchain to host RCP. It is a low-cost Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain designed for social media and gaming. It is more centralized, hence lower cost, than Arbitrum One. This is a reason it is not as good for defi. 

Arbitrum Nova has some drawbacks. Most people don’t know it exists. Very few exchanges allow you to withdraw ETH to it, requiring the use of a defi bridge to get ETH on Arbitrum Nova. There is an ETH faucet on Reddit, but unless you are familiar with Reddit you would likely not know about the faucet. T

Another negative about Arbitrum Nova is that it does not have a community outside of RCPs. There are very few dapps that operate on the blockchain. Since there are very few people using Arbitrum Nova it will be a lot more difficult to make a casual purchase. Ecosystem

**Solana submitted a proposal for Reddit Community Points**

There were over 20 proposals and [Solana was one of them](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/fznd7jq/). I am not a fan of the Solana blockchain. It at one point had stablecoins with questionable backing. It is known for going down at random times (although the blockchain is more stable now than it was in the past).

Despite the negatives, there are many positives about Solana. Solana has a large community that is very active on Twitter and other social media outlets. This community is more focused on social dapps, gaming, and NFTs. There is some defi on Solana, but that is not the focus of the chain. This is just the type of community that would be interested in RCPs and it could have had a positive impact on the price. It also could have led to an increase in r/cc users.

**I think Reddit made the best choice with Arbitrum Nova for RCPs. A well-regarded Ethereum L2 is better than Solana in the long run even if Solana might have a better price impact on RCPs initially.**",21,2023-08-08 21:38:52,206

SOL,cryptocurrency,"Solana DEX Volume Surpasses Ethereum, BNB Chain","Solana's stronghold this cycle has not been limited to its price; data shows that other parts of the ecosystem continue to dominate the market.

According to DeFiLlama, Solana’s Decentralized Exchange (DEX) volume was more than that of Ethereum and BNB Chain combined in the last 24 hours. Both registered higher weekly increases, but that was not enough to keep Solana from the top spot.

As seen below, Solana’s DEX volume is $2.24 billion. However, BNB Chain is $703.19 million, while Ethereum is $1.41 billion.

**Solana's Market Share**

As a result of the increase, Solana now holds roughly 36% of the total volume. The rise in the metric is linked to several reasons, such as staking and the utility of applications built on the chain.

Particularly, the increase in meme coin trading on the network’s decentralised applications has been crucial to this hike.

For much of this market cycle, meme coins built on the Solana blockchain have performed better than any other network. As such, demand for SOL and user activity has been hitting different peaks at different times.

$SOL performs well in general too. The coin is 3rd after world's N1 Crypto and ETH by 24-hour trading volume($3.3 Billion). The largest markets for Solana are Binance, OKX, WhiteBIT, and Coinbase respectively (Based on Coingecko) - 23.07.2024

The mint wallet I believe is (4BGKKuj26cbxJNszGXMMzw1gettydfg8SVfaAnRWZ9ud) moving around 15k solana through various different wallets.

Let this be a lesson folks. If the team is a ghost even if the discord community is great, the end result will be like this most often than not.

 NFT minting programs will like be temporarily blocked as part of the restart instructions according to validator discussions.  This will prevent further catastrophic downtime  as soon as the current one is resolved.

SOL,cryptocurrency,5 reasons why Solana is crashing harder than most,"**Solana has just crashed 43% in the past 24 hours and has fallen 56% in the past 3 days, while it still continues to fall**

Of course all cryptos are falling today due to the FTX + Binance news, and even Bitcoin has hit new bear market lows below $16,500 but solana is getting hurt worst of all for 5 reasons…

1- FTX has been making large investments in Solana over the past year as well as promoting the Solana ecosystem publicly. Now that FTX is essentially bankrupt, Solana just lost all of that support.

2- Nearly $1b worth of staked Solana is set to be unlocked tomorrow, which represents 13% of the coin’s circulating supply. Usually when staked tokens are unlocked users sell some right away to take profit, but this time users are likely to sell most of their solana in order to salvage any portion of their investment.

3- Binance and [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) just suspended USDC and USDT stable coin deposits and withdrawals on the solana blockchain.

4- The CEO of Binance is reported to own about 10% of all Solana tokens and as Solana continues to fall, investors are worried that he will sell all his Solana in order to buy more Binance coin in order to support the Binance blockchain.

5- Solana promoted itself as the ‘Ethereum killer’ but solana does not have unwavering loyalty from its holders that ethereum has. When solana begins to fall people abandon ship, but ethereum holders have been shown to hold during bad times as they have more of a long term view.

Obviously I’m not some market guru or oracle who can see the future so this is just my feelings and thoughts plus the sentiment that I’ve been getting for the past year

SOL,cryptocurrency,"Solend, the largest lending market on Solana is about to have a crippling liquidation of $170m SOL that could crash the network. To prevent this, the decentralized protocol is proposing to seize the user's funds via governance","There is a large liquidation watch on Solana's Solend protocol, where a whale has  deposited 5.7M SOL  ($170M and borrowed 108M USDC and USDT borrowed. This alone accounts for a huge % of borrowing on Solana, and now this position is under a liquidation threat. 

The whale is not closing their position. In most protocols like Compound, or AAVE, Maker etc, this will result in an onchain liquidation. Infact we have seen many such large liquidations on AAVE And Maker recently, and everything has worked as expected. 

However such a large liquidation in an illiquid market and unstable network like Solana is likely to have vastly damaging consequences. Solana network has already gone down and halted half a dozen time. 

The Solend team explains what could happen to the network:

>This  could cause chaos, putting a strain on the Solana network. Liquidators  would be especially active and spamming the liquidate function, which  has been known to be a factor causing Solana to go down in the past.  
>  
>**Letting a liquidation of this size to happen on-chain is extremely risky.**  DEX liquidity isn’t deep enough to handle a sale of this size and could  cause cascading effects. Additionally, liquidators will be incentivized  to spam the network in an effort to win very lucrative liquidations.  This has been known to cause load issues for Solana in the past which  would exacerbate the problems at hand.

So to prevent this, they are proposing to literally steal the user's funds and execute OTC trades:

>Grant  emergency power to Solend Labs to temporarily take over the whale’s  account so the liquidation can be executed OTC and avoid pushing Solana  to its limits. This would be done via a smart contract upgrade.  Emergency powers will be revoked once the whale’s account reaches a safe  level.

When shit starts to implode, all the true colors of decentralization comes out. 

These shitty protocol are run by fly by night cowboys who learnt basics of economics during the bull run. They put their users are risk by running terrible protocols that do not think about all the edge cases...because who cares about risks right?! 

And during signs of distress, they resolve to seize user funds.",11519,2022-06-19 11:17:30,2241
SOL,cryptocurrency,"Solana is centralized, stoppable and its fundamental design flaws are considered features by SOL guys. Genuine decentralisation and well-designed security make a far more valuable proposition than some big TPS numbers. If you can't run a full-node yourself then it's just another bank.","I'll start with September '21 and the quote from Gavin Wood:

Events of today in crypto just go to show that genuine decentralisation and well-designed security make a far more valuable proposition than some big tps numbers coming from an exclusive and closed set of servers. If you can't run a full-node yourself then it's just another bank.

Fast forward to December '21 and quote from Justin Bons:

Solana was DDoS attacked again. This attack exploited fundamental design flaws which are considered features by SOL.  As it sacrifices decentralization & security for speed while ignoring the consequences of that trade off  specifically Proof of History & Turbine (PoH).

A consequence of PoH is deterministic block creation:  There is a good reason why public blockchains before SoL did not take this route.  Non-deterministic block creation adds to security & censorship resistance as you cannot predict who will create the next block.

Instead in SoL it is possible to predict & therefore attack the next block producers.  For instance attacking the next 100 validators instead of attacking the entire network.  This attack also works regardless of scale, thereby severely reducing SOL security.

SOL security is not just reduced against DDoS attacks since this attack can also be combined with a 51% attack  allowing an attacker to temporarily gain proportional staked control over the network by attacking other large stake holders. These are all consequences of PoH!

Combining Turbine with PoH leads to even more dire consequences:  Turbine divides the transaction memory pool into small groupings of validators.  This means that with PoH you can censor transactions by just attacking the specific validators in that grouping!

This is just one aspect of SOL's design that exposes the bad faith of its creation.  Prioritizing attracting ignorant cryptocurrency investors over good sustainable blockchain design.  There are many examples like this in terms of design as well as lies & fraud, buyer beware

TL;DR: Solana is a shit network, SOL is a shitcoin and when VC dumps their SOL it's gonna be spectacular like diarrhea.

SOL,cryptocurrency,5 major reasons not to buy SOL!,"**1) DeFi is struggling**

The TVL in $ is going up in the recent months but that's only because the SOL price is pumping but in reality if you switch the currency from $ to SOL on DeFillama you see a clear trend, the TVL in SOL is waaaaay down from its ATH [https://defillama.com/chain/Solana?currency=SOL](https://defillama.com/chain/Solana?currency=SOL) (toggle between $ and SOL) and hasn't recovered from the FTX and SBF saga.

**2) The 3 biggest cheerleaders ft. VCs who pumped SOL are gone or unable to help due to their own issues**

FTX + SBF gone. They pumped so much money into it and invested in the ""ecosystem"" during the last bull run but all that is gone now. No more capital, influence and support. Jump crypto (Chicago firm's crypto arm) can't/won't pump more money into it like last time. The same goes for MultiCoin Capital...

**3) Bankruptcy estate selling/dumping**

71M SOL or 17% of circulating supply and that's a ton of SOL to dump any way you slice and spin it...

**4) Unsustainable economics**

Solana barley generates any network revenue (5 figures $ a day) which is pitiful for a network worth billions of $ and it's less than the cost of maintaining the network -> token inflation that's used to pay the network validators. Unless that changes they have to rely on the speculators to drive the price up and keep them from entering the death spiral. The fees can't be increased though because that will ruin their value proposition...

**5) Probably the most important con: its complex and experimental design**

Its architecture has led to undesirable outcomes that have affected  Solana's technical stability.

Between January 2022 and February 2023, Solana had  occasions in 7 out of those 13 months with outages. The most recent of  these outages, on February 25, 2023, lasted nearly 19 hours. The core  issue of this outage and others in the past stems from the fact that  **Solana is running an experimental system.**

**There is no formal  verification of the Solana consensus mechanism, nor is there the ability  to predict future failures in Solana's design because of the colossal  data volumes that the system processes.** Though Solana has implemented  numerous improvements to mitigate past issues, **Solana's design may make  it impossible to understand future complications until they happen. As a  result, the Solana team still considers the chain to be in “Beta”  because future network failures could result from unforeseen causes and  because of the complexity of Solana and the amount of data it  processes, resolving these issues might take substantial periods of time  to fix.**

**Clearly, this dynamic is unacceptable to serious financial and  non-financial businesses that may want to deploy to Solana. The  unpredictability of uptime is partly responsible for Solana's low TVL  (total valued locked) in decentralized finance relative to its peers.**  While the Solana team has implemented what they believe are important  fixes, network fragility will remain an issue for the foreseeable  future, and the roll-out of the new design Firedancer may even increase  the potential for irreconcilable problems.

SOL,cryptocurrency,"Rant: Why I'm done with SOL, and why you should pull out too.","Typed on mobile. 

Somewhere in this sub I read about DCA'ing top ten coins outperformed trying to find the next moonshot over the long term. SOL was a top ten coin at some point in time . So I decided time to expand my portfolio and buy some SOL. 


At first it was quite nice, the concentrated liquidity pools (Whirlpools) on the Orca DEX was really nice and I was making sweet returns (provided I monitored the price range closely)

Then came many network issues (down times). Orca didn't work because the SOL network was down. My whirlpool fell below my liquidity range due to the price drop and I lost because I couldn't pull out my liquidity. 

Not learning my lesson, I continued on until yesterday. 

Then came yesterday's hack. Hot wallets being drained, no one knows what's happening. 

I log in into my Solflair wallet - nothing.  F*** looks like I got hacked.  I decide to check out the Blockchain explorer, enter my wallet address and I get ""error not found"".  OMW did this hacker hack me so hard my wallet is off the network??? 

I double checked my wallet addresses and I tried opened my  different devices and browsers  (using my seed phrase). Still nothing. My SOL (and liquidity pools) were gone!  


Like any investor   I made peace with this and move on with my day. After all SOL was simply one coin in a balanced portfolio. 

Last night I thought let me report my wallet as being affected by the hack in case there are compensation schemes. But first I'll double check my wallets. 

And my word. All my SOL, all my liquidity pools, all there like magic. I'm grateful, I swapped into ETH. But I'm also done with SOL


So if your still into SOL as an investor ask yourself:

- How can this  crapchain can be restarted by Dev's on demand?

- Why does  crap chain has multiple downtime a year?

- Why the hell can your coins not be seen the morning of the hack? Is the network so overwhelmed that you can't even see coins in the Blockchain explorer?   (I thought SOL was supposed to be super fast?)

- why the hell must we defend poor service? Other Blockchains offer speed, reliability and Defi too. 


I'm grateful I finally pulled out with no losses.  And I hope you manage to pull out too.  SOL has a long way to go before it reaches the reliability and uptime  of other Blockchains. 


Thank you for reading.


TL; Dr : I've pulled out of SOL. 

Network downtime losses me money.  Inability to track my coins during hacks/network overloads  on the block explorer shatters my confidence in the network.

You should pull out too

EDIT:  I shopped around and if you want to get a computer to run a solana node, you will need to invest 5k to 10k USD.  Here are the specs: Hardware Recommendations#

    CPU
        12 cores / 24 threads, or more
        2.8GHz, or faster
        AVX2 instruction support (to use official release binaries, self-compile otherwise)
        Support for AVX512f and/or SHA-NI instructions is helpful
        The AMD Threadripper Zen3 series is popular with the validator community
    RAM
        128GB, or more
        Motherboard with 256GB capacity suggested
    Disk
        PCIe Gen3 x4 NVME SSD, or better
        Accounts: 500GB, or larger. High TBW (Total Bytes Written)
        Ledger: 1TB or larger. High TBW suggested
        OS: (Optional) 500GB, or larger. SATA OK
        The OS may be installed on the ledger disk, though testing has shown better performance with the ledger on its own disk
        Accounts and ledger can be stored on the same disk, however due to high IOPS, this is not recommended
        The Samsung 970 and 980 Pro series SSDs are popular with the validator community
    GPUs
        Not strictly necessary at this time
        Motherboard and power supply speced to add one or more high-end GPUs in the future suggested

SOL,cryptocurrency,SOL attacked yet again. Why invest in SOL when cryptocurrencies with 100 percent uptime exist?,"It's common knowledge here that the SOL network goes down frequently, gets hacked, doesn't work etc yet people still continue to invest in it. And yet again it was attacked recently! If traditional banking was this flakey the government would haul it over the coals and watch it burn.

Yet people still invest in this centralized chain.

Litecoin for example (and I am sure there are many other examples that people can name) has had 100 percent uptime with literally no hacks or exploits, yet people instantly dismiss.

It brings me to the conclusion that we don't really care about fundamentals in the crypto space, only juicy profits. 

So it brings me back to the original point of this post, why an earth are people investing in SOL when it is the least secure and reliable chain in crypto?",1117,2022-05-01 08:42:41,669

Thanks to the insight of [/u/abeliabedelia](https://www.reddit.com/u/abeliabedelia/), based on the opcode budget limit for each transaction, it was determined that ***a tinyman swap requires 4 transactions***, which means that Algorand’ TPS divided by 4 is approximately equal to its ability for smart contracts per second. (6500/4) = 1625 swaps per second.

People foreshadowed in the comments on one of my previous posts saying that it could definitely be done in less than four transactions, but I wanted to be conservative at the time.

SOL,cryptocurrency,SOL is a shitstorm waiting to eat your money,"what are people's opinions of Solana these days?

I personally still think it is hot trash that's propped up by VC money. A lot of the wrapped assets on the chain like WBTC were minted with backing held at FTX and that backing has since gone down the toilet. It feels like it's only a matter of time until the insolvency of those assets becomes more apparent. The bill comes due!If all the WBTC were to be moved from the SOL chain, the on-chain liquidity for its counterpart would not exist to cover the amount in circulation there and the peg would be lost.

The tech has been a long-running joke in the defi community and while recent updates are an objective improvement, it's still miles behind ETH and many of its layer 2 rollups.

I am amazed at the amount of bullish sentiment i see around SOL tokens, can someone make me understand how this token is not destined to fuck me out of my money if i go near it?

FTX still holds hundreds of millions of these tokens and will likely liquidate them to cover debtor obligations. It feels like people are flocking to become exit liquidity for this inevitable sell-off because of some short-term low liquidity pumps. I see that FTX custody party has staked about $130 million of its SOL to try and ease these concerns but who the fuck cares when they hold over $1 billion worth of this shit coin and need to sell sooner or later.

seems like money is moving into the ecosystem to attract short-term speculators to help bolster the available liquidity so that FTX can get a better price for when its time to sell.

Im short sold and averaging down the short on this pump, fuck this token lol

Update: I took some profits from the position on 11/2 when we pulled back from $45 to $39 

Later my vpn saved me from staying in the position since it switched to USA without me noticing and my wallet got banned from DyDx for using the platform with web traffic from a blocked jurisdiction. That forced me to close around $43 and realize a net loss of about 10% 

I have not opened a new short since. This play was of course not my only crypto position and even with the loss I’m up ~16% across the board. Trading short SOL was not a great move though.",309,2023-10-21 09:40:58,645

The attacker swapped the stolen fund into 69422.9 SOL and 6,497,738 USDCet via Jupiter. Then, the USDCet was bridged to the Ethereum network with the help of Wormhole and swapped to 6,064ETH via Uniswap soon after.

For those who just came out of a coma — after an attack, the entire Solana blockchain was paused for about 17 hours. No tx possible. Billions of dollars locked in DeFi were not accessible.

The mere fact that a blockchain can be kill-switched just like that defeats its purpose — it's not very different from your bank account where your funds can be frozen.

Then, for a coin to stay that high up, it needs HUGE money going in continuously.

At the moment, I can't honestly imagine how an investor with hundreds of thousands of dollars, choosing a blockchain to DeFi, lp, farm or whatever, after some basic research goes with Solana.

Just because a coin is rising doesn't mean it's necessarily a good project. Yes, it could eventually make a case to be a competitor to ETH. But there are still a lot of risks along the way.

Just to give a small history lesson. Last bull run, do you guys remember the project TRON (TRX)? Led by Justin Sun (who r/cc seems to hate), they were in the top 10 coins by market cap during the last bull run. People made money! But now? They're #29, and the project hasn't really gone anywhere.

SOL,cryptocurrency,Deep Dive into Pepe(SOL),"I've been diving deep into the PEPE(SOL) token, and I wanted to share my findings. After all, everyone always says, DYOR, and I took that to heart. I created a detailed Dune Analytics Dasboard (I won't link it here, but you can go find it - search ""pepesol""

Accumulation by Top 1,000 & 5,000 Holders:

One of the most intriguing insights from my research is the accumulation trend among the top 1,000 & 5,000 holders of Pepe(SOL). According to the data from my Dune Analytics dashboard, these holders have been steadily increasing their positions. Here’s a closer look at what this means and why it's a positive indicator for the project. Here are two graphs of the current distribution:

https://preview.redd.it/riac86q6ll3d1.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce1de2dc491008969db2b50ea1f416c467ea2b6

Now this distribution is not for the total supply of 1B tokens, but of the top wallets. 

# Data Highlights:

* **Consistent Accumulation:** Over the past few days, there's been a clear trend of accumulation among the top 1,000 and 5000 holders. This is not just a sporadic spike but a sustained increase in holdings.
* **Large Holders Confidence:** The top holders, who are often more informed and strategic, seem to have a strong conviction in the project. Their actions can be seen as a vote of confidence in Pepe(SOL)’s potential. Or they're just degenerate gamblers like me. 
* **Market Stability:** When a significant portion of the supply is held by these top holders, it can contribute to market stability. These holders are less likely to panic sell, reducing the likelihood of sharp price drops.

These two illustrations show the amount of net positive change to their collective wallets over the past 24 hours:

# Why Accumulation is Positive

# 1. Confidence in the Project:

Accumulation by top holders indicates their confidence in the project's future. These holders likely have access to better information and resources, and their actions can reflect positive expectations for the project's development and long-term value.

# 2. Reduced Volatility:

When a large percentage of the token supply is held by committed holders, it can lead to reduced market volatility. This stability is crucial for attracting new investors who are often wary of highly volatile assets.

# 3. Potential for Growth:

With more tokens being accumulated and taken out of circulation, the potential for price appreciation increases as demand outpaces the available supply. This can create a more favorable environment for price growth.

**TRANSACTION VOLUME**

Another critical aspect of analyzing the Pepe(SOL) token is examining the transaction volume and the growth in the number of holders over the past 5 days. This data can provide insights into the token’s current activity and adoption trends.

# Transaction Volume

Over the past 5 days, Pepe(SOL) has seen a notable increase in transaction volume. Here are some key points:

* **Daily Transactions:** The number of daily transactions has been on a steady pace. This suggests growing interest and activity within the Pepe(SOL) ecosystem.
* **Average Transaction Size:** Alongside the increase in the number of transactions, the average transaction size has also shown a moderate rise. This indicates not only more frequent transactions but also larger ones, possibly reflecting increased confidence among traders and investors.
* **Peak Activity:** There was a significant spike in transaction volume on the first day, due to a major announcement of the dev sending 15% of the total supply to Pauly0x (he's since distributed out 5% of the tokens to the community). These spikes can be seen as a negative, but the distribution for holders has been good.

# Holder Growth

The number of unique holders is a vital metric for understanding the token's adoption. Over the past 5 days, Pepe(SOL) has experienced substantial growth in its holder base:

* **New Holders:** There has been a steady increase in the number of new holders each day, indicating that more individuals are becoming interested in and investing in Pepe(SOL).
* **Retention Rate:** The retention rate of holders (the percentage of holders who continue to hold the token over time) remains high. This suggests that once individuals invest in Pepe(SOL), they are likely to hold onto it rather than selling off quickly.
* **Cumulative Growth:** The cumulative growth rate of holders over the past 5 days shows a strong upward trajectory. This reflects increasing adoption and a growing community of supporters.

https://preview.redd.it/uxle1sm6nl3d1.png?width=1658&format=png&auto=webp&s=33bd17b190d9dc18ff44f580db4276451ae8a9e1

# Why This Matters

The rise in transaction volume and the growth in the number of holders are both positive indicators for Pepe(SOL). Here’s why:

1. **Increased Liquidity:** Higher transaction volumes generally mean increased liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell the token without significantly impacting the price.
2. **Wider Adoption:** The growth in the number of holders suggests that Pepe(SOL) is gaining traction and attracting a broader audience. This can lead to a more robust and active community, which is crucial for the long-term success of any project.
3. **Positive Market Sentiment:** Rising transaction volumes and holder growth typically reflect positive market sentiment. When more people are buying and holding a token, it often indicates confidence in the project's future.

  
So if this post stays up, great, I hope that you can look at PEPE(SOL) as a serious token on the Solana blockchain. But also, when people say DYOR to pass the buck, do some analysis of your own. Build out a Dune Analytics Dashboard to help you make decisions. Does your project have data readily available? Also - this will flip PEPE on ETH which I bought into on the third day at $6M market cap; it's been good to me.

At the same time, Binance, Coinbase, ( I believe FTX too), KuCoin and probably others I didn’t hear about suspended all deposits and withdrawals. So nobody with coins to move could even get them on exchanges to sell.

Meanwhile, People with staked coins can’t unstake/withdraw them until the Solana network epoch turns over. That doesn’t happen until several hours from now (according to solanabeach.io status tracker)

 But oh wait, unstaking was suspended on some apps too (reports coming from Exodus users)

As far as I know, Binance and Coinbase are still suspended.

There are tens of billions of dollars worth of coins still stuck in DeFi or unable to be moved on or off exchanges. The price is still being stabilized by incremental leveraged positions and wash/arb trading bots moving volume around 

There seems to be some blatant and desperate interference being run from the exchanges, who have been silent about this thus far. If there really was a mass SOL exodus, they’d have probably been bled dry of liquidity. 

Meanwhile investors are sitting on millions of dollars of losses they can’t mitigate, with their coins being held hostage. 

It’s all super sketchy and the participants need to be called out on it.",400,2021-09-16 07:48:11,317

SOL,cryptocurrency,ETH or SOL based alts. You can only choose one for the bullrun,"Investors and crypto enthusiasts, as we anticipate the next bull run post-halving, I’m curious about your strategies. Between Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) based altcoins, which do you think offers the best potential for return on investment (ROI), and why?

ETH is widely adopted with a large ecosystem supporting it. Despite high gas fees, its shift to proof-of-stake with Ethereum 2.0 is promising. SOL, on the other hand, offers high throughput at lower transaction costs but has faced network stability issues.

Considering the above, which platform’s altcoins do you believe will outperform in the coming bull market phase? What market cap ranges are you targeting, and what’s your take on the different genres or sectors within these ecosystems that might lead the charge (DeFi, NFTs, Gaming, etc.)?

Let’s dive into the pros and cons of betting on ETH or SOL-based projects for the upcoming bull run. Please share your insights on market cap targets and the project genres you think will have the edge.",0,2024-02-17 09:59:57,165
SOL,cryptocurrency,"It is amazing how much of the dirt is on Solana. Add hacks, downtime, resets... It is absurd how easy it is to manipulate the market and the community to invest in Sol. through false metrics & attract ""investors"" who believe in it. A long, thought-provoking thread...","Solana isn't as popular as it seems. **Through false metrics, it attracted investors who believed in an inflated and fake activity.**  A long, thought-provoking thread...

Solana saw an explosive growth in the last bull-run.  Among the reasons were low fees, low block time.  But today we will talk about other key reasons: **fake TPS, fake DAU,  fake TVL • fake decentralization • fake supply • Dirty money** 

[FAKE TPS](https://twitter.com/Davyegld/status/1653070947635560449/photo/1)

Let's start with the famous part, and then go into the ""unknown"" ones.  For a long time, **Solana has been shilled by influencers for its high number of fake transactions per second.**  Why? You decide.  [@solana](https://twitter.com/solana)  main explorer doesn't show real TPS.  Why? You decide.

A large portion of txs comes directly from consensus txs, a design choice.  High transactions has nothing to do with usage.  Doing some easy calculations on Solana compass, we can see that: • On av. 4k TPS • **90% are vote txs • Only 10% are real txs**  4k tps? [Only 400 real tps!](https://twitter.com/Davyegld/status/1653070950135463938/photo/1)

Wait! But 400 tps is still an incredible metric! Yes... but no. Let's start skimming this number to arrive at a more truthful one.  First data to bear in mind: Failed transactions 📷  Around 13% of Solana txs are failed txs, but are counted in the tps.  [400 - 13% = 348tps](https://twitter.com/Davyegld/status/1653070952387715074/photo/1)

 Oh and about them, I wasn't able to determine how many of them are counted in the tps on the explorer. Not sure.   I counted all of them anyway. Sol did too for some outages, stating they were able to ""handle"" 400k txs... [you wish!](https://twitter.com/Justin_Bons/status/1576984070114144257)

 We now have to acknowledge another thing.  Due to Solana design and low fees, lot of bots sign txs on the chain.  But how many? **Up to 98% of transactions are made by bots.**  348 - 98% = 7tps made by humans  Here's some on [old chain analysis](https://twitter.com/Davyegld/status/1653070957014052865/photo/1) made by [@runkellen](https://twitter.com/runkellen) on [@flipsidecrypto](https://twitter.com/flipsidecrypto)

 All blockchains have bots. But [Solana has more... way more.](https://twitter.com/SolBulletin/status/1647713375164538885) Amount of daily txs per active address(16/04): [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&src=cashtag_click): 6.6 [$AVAX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AVAX&src=cashtag_click): 15.7 [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click): 2.8 [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click): 7.7 [$NEAR](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24NEAR&src=cashtag_click): 6.5 [$EGLD](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24EGLD&src=cashtag_click): 14.5 [$BNB](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BNB&src=cashtag_click): 3.1  And [$SOL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click):117 Or 7.5x times of the highest.

**117 txs per active wallet would mean that the average user on Solana should do on AVERAGE: • 117 txs per day • 3500 per month • 42700 per year  A clear and simple proof of how easy it is to see that SOL is full of bots.** 

 Let's say **we want to calculate how many txs would be made if SOL had normal txs per address**.  The average for the chains considered is 8txs.  On 16/04 SOL had 226k DAU [@nansen\_ai](https://twitter.com/nansen_ai)  
 .  226k \* 8 = 1.8mln daily txs  **That equals to 21 tps,** or 41 with [$AVAX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AVAX&src=cashtag_click) numbers.  **10/20 times lower!**

FAKE DAU  

How many are real? Data from Nansen:  286k Daily active accounts: • 213k wallets • 14,7k token accounts • 57,9k program accounts  20% of all daily active accounts are programs. 

[FAKE TVL](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/08/05/the-fake-team-that-made-solana-defi-look-huge/)

It's well documented but worth mentioning.  It helped SOL to increase in value during the bull-market and his defi look way better than it was.  **Out of 10.5B TVL, 7.5B were FAKE! 70% of the TVL was fake**.  Why didn't Sol team notice? You decide. 

FAKE DECENTRALIZATION 

 A network can be considered decentralized when no single entity can control it.  Now, a big problem of Solana is relying on vertical scalability.  What does it mean?  **Solana nodes are extremely expensive.** 

You can look at docs for recommended hardware but keep in mind that big validators run on 10gps and not 1 + have dedicated GPUs = even higher costs.  + No minimum stake for validators, that has to pay to partecipate in consensus each epoch.  3 SOL every 2-3 days: 22$ per day now 

 These enormous costs lead to a consequence: [70% validators aren't profitable.](https://twitter.com/Davyegld/status/1653070991772340226/photo/1)  What? Why do they run nodes then?  Simply... Cause **Sol foundation gives them money to stay profitable. Without his help it'd have way less validators.** 

 Some (still a low number) stake with Jito client and similar, that provides **absurdly low costs for nodes**.   How? Simply, **they plan to profit from MEV attacks**: **auctioning block space to searchers that front-run users reordering blocks.  Real decentralization?** You decide.

Supply and FTX  

Let's start with an interesting lie about Sol supply, an old 2020 story.  Solana team lied to the community about his circulating supply.  Circulating supply: • Official: 8.5 mln • Real: 20 mln 

[2020 and 2021 were two incredible years for the Solana foundation!](https://twitter.com/Davyegld/status/1653071006334869505/photo/1)They found a really generous investor that had a famous investing firm, sir [@SBF\_FTX](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX).  T**hey raised 58mln$ that helped Solana boost his ecosystem.  Problem? It was later discovered that these generous investments were made by Alameda with money from FTX depositors.  Sam was basically a Solana team member, how didn't they notice? You decide.  As always, the team had no idea of the situation.** 

**TL;DR:**  Every chain has been dirty in some way, some more, some less.  But it is amazing how much of the dirt is on Solana.  Add hacks, downtime, resets, unauthorized unstake, lobbying.  It is absurd how easy it is to manipulate the market and the community to invest in Sol.

SOL,cryptocurrency,Machine learning algorithm fails to predict the price of SOL,"17 days ago one of the users here posted a link to an article titled ""Machine learning algorithm sets Solana price for September 30, 2023"" stating that:

""As it happens, the machine algorithms employed by the cryptocurrency forecast platform PricePredictions have set the price of Solana at $17.57 for September 30, 2023, according to the latest information retrieved by Finbold on September 13.""

SOL price at the moment of the forecast was $18.177.

If they have modern machine learning algorithms, we also have the good old reddit remindme bots so I employed the help of our friend.

17 days have gone by and guess what, Solana price is at $20.26. Surprised Pikachu face.

So it unsurprisingly turns out that AI isn't much smarter than the average crypto Bob. This, on my trustworthy crypto predictor scale, puts them somewhere between a crypto expert and a top crypto analyst. This is still far from the top crypto insider and a piece of shit crypto insider trader.

SOL,cryptocurrency,This is how you make money with crypto,"I'm going to tell you the strategy that I used to go from 2k to 15k, and that I will start using again from now on since I got down to 8k from trying to do stupid leverage trades and using options:

Step 1: find a couple coins with good projects and fundamentals that you believe will be good in the furute, mines are ETH, DOT, MATIC, and SOL.

Step 2: send them to a wallet, write down the seed phrase in a piece of paper an store it somewhere safe.

Step 3: delete whatever trading app/website you are using, unsubscribe from al crypto news, forums and whatever, just cut all your connections with crypto and don't even look at the market.

Step 4: live happily for a couple years without worrying about your crypto or looking at them, do shit, have fun.

Step 5: after a couple years check how rich you are now and buy whatever the fuck you want.

SOL,cryptocurrency,I think Solana is the most over rated crypto and does not deserve a top 5 spot,"Maybe it's just me but I dont see how Solana is so high up the rankings when theres so much controversy around it. The technology is good but aside from that it's an absolute shit coin, another ""ethereum killer"" that will probably die out once the biggest investors sell their bags. 

For starters how can the devs shut down the blockchain because of a glitch then call the platform decentralised? Do you think crypto could of ever come this far if satoshi shut down btc for repairs? Absolute nonsense.

Then there was the discovery of a hidden 12 million coins which wasint disclosed to any investor. 12,000,000× £160 (roughly at the moment)= £1,920,000,000 is a lot of money to hide for no specific reason.

And dont forget the announcement of bringing tether  to their blockchain like that's something to be proud of, everyone in the crypto space knows tether is a liability and could put everyone's investment at risk.

SOL,cryptocurrency,"ADA, Matic, Atom, Sol, Algo and others were deemed a security a week ago. When this happened to XRP, XRP also dropped hard for a week straight. After that week, XRP did a 11x in 15 weeks.","Almost 7 days ago, the SEC called many popular tokens a security, such as Cardano, Matic, Solana, Atom, Algorand, Near, and others. They have all seen major losses over the past week. In 7 days, they dropped:

* ADA: -19%
* Solana: -22%
* Matic: -24%
* Atom: -9%
* Near: -14%
* Algo: -10%

Fear is high, and many people have sold or are considering selling. Is it over for these cryptocurrencies? Perhaps not!

&#x200B;

A similar thing happened to XRP, when Ripple was sued by the SEC on December 22, 2020, because XRP was alleged to be a security. XRP instantly started crashing and went down 67% in a week! A much more severe reaction. Everyone panicked and thought it was over. Many people capitulated.

[XRP capitulation: -67&#37; in 7 days.](https://preview.redd.it/orsw1v4ee86b1.png?width=1877&format=png&auto=webp&s=877b3a04fafa9dd6c10500fa93bd0c28534250d7)

.. but it was not the end. A week after the lawsuit started, XRP hit the price of $0.17. That was the ultimate buying moment. From that point, XRP did about a 11x to $1.96 in 15 weeks! Also, the $0.17 price was not seen again.

[Orange line: $0.17 bottom \(7 days after lawsuit\); purple line: price the moment Ripple got sued](https://preview.redd.it/gadu1apjf86b1.png?width=1881&format=png&auto=webp&s=e70cb0e9d447c309fb14f85e198f90bc2ad50249)

If you bought the blood, you would still be up more than a 2x now. That said, even now, XRP is below the price of $0.52 - the price it had when Ripple was sued by the SEC.

Im not saying that the same thing must happen to the alts called a security now. But it might be good to know that buying the blood with XRP paid off. It was the final shakeout (""spring"") before liftoff.",78,2023-06-15 19:42:02,150

***Find the full blog post with all the tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the FOUR YEAR REPORT for the 2018 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, NEM, DASH, IOTA,** and **Stellar.**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting every single month for four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and more recently, the [2022 Top Ten a few weeks ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/). ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.
* **December** **Highlights:** A bloody, all-red month
* **Overall since Jan. 2018:** **ETH** solidly in the lead, followed by **BTC** and **ADA.**  After briefly pulling ahead earlier in the year, ***the 2018 Top Ten are now significantly underperforming the S&P 500*** over the same time period.  Q: So, big crypto fail, right?
* A: Only if I stopped after the first year.  The **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 406%, much, much better than traditional markets over the same time period (**fancy new chart at the very bottom of the post).

***Some exciting new changes for*** [2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!***

1. I'll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis (down to two reports per month)
2. Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time. 
3. Factoring in stablecoin gains:  In past years, I have not included the ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports.  This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).
4. Giveaways: Who doesn’t love a good old fashioned giveaway? I’ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I’m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.
5. Friendly competition: I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP r/TotalCryptoMarketCap) to see which one outperforms.

And here we go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Four Year Report – UP 34%

https://preview.redd.it/c3c6wlctpgb81.jpg?width=1056&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=380248b14486edaa5749fba7a390198bf81260a0

Welcome to the four year report!

The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, IOTA, NEM, Dash,** and **Stellar**.  

December highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **100% red month**. **IOTA** falls the least, only down -4% (on news that staking on the Firefly wallet will yield two cryptos, Assembly and Shimmer).
* **ETH** maintains a solid overall lead, **BTC** in second place, **ADA** in third.  Three coins in the green since January 2018.
* After four years, the 2018 Portfolio is +34%, behind the S&P 500’s ROI over the same time period.

## December Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in ranks since January 2018:

https://preview.redd.it/ulc9dwgvpgb81.jpg?width=412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2eadc9a98ec75b726cef37af7cb716fddf3126db

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:** After four years of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have remained.  **NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA**, and **Litecoin** have been replaced by **Binance Coin, Tether**, **DOT, SOL**, **LUNA**, and **USDC.  NEM** looks like it wants to be the first to drop out of the Top 100.

## December Winners and Losers

***December Winners*** –  **IOTA** outperformed the pack, dropping only -4% this month. 100% of the cryptos in the red.

***December Losers*** –   Losing nearly a third of its value, **Litecoin** fell the most, down -30%. **NEM** followed **LTC**, dropping -27% in December.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After four years, here’s a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment. 

https://preview.redd.it/lisz7rgxpgb81.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbf41f94e9716f0140f3a7dfff3f655fa9d21a59

With 11, **Bitcoin** has two more monthly wins than second place **Cardano**.  **NEM** has finished last place most often (12 months out of 48).

**Bitcoin** is still the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).

## Overall Update –  2021 ends with a whimper. After four years, ETH in first place, and Dash and NEM tied for worst overall performance.

After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in [October](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46), the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio continued to lose value.  After four years of holding these cryptos, only 3 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green: **BTC,** **ETH,** and **ADA.**

Overall, first place **ETH** (+413%) is well ahead of **BTC** (+257%) and third place **ADA** (+99%).

The initial $100 invested in first place **ETH** four years ago?  It’s worth $515 today.

**DASH** and **NEM** are virtually tied at the bottom, both down over -86% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.**  The initial $100 invested in each four ago is worth about $13 today.  

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/mldnsr7zpgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=d82435bc0e39657707f2143fb5dd1951f6ddcfd1

End of December 2021 market cap: **$2,211,626,655,207**

The total crypto market dropped significantly in December.  Crypto as a sector is still up +285% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+34%), the return of the S&P (+78%) over the same period of time, and nine of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for **Ethereum)**.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.65T in** [**October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/)**.**

## Bitcoin dominance:

**BitDom** declined a bit in December, ending the month at 40.2%.  When looking at the entire four year 2018 Experiment time frame, **BTC** dominance is near the low end.  For context:   

Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**33% in January 2018**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one).

High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: 

https://preview.redd.it/cxtd9lb1qgb81.jpg?width=339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25b3da0034194812e2b66f977450fff1555b48fb

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost $325 in December.

If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, **the $1000 initial investment would be worth $1,341**, up 34% from [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

Green is unfamiliar territory for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio and a recent development.  Over the first four years of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only ten months of green.  And all ten of the green months have come in 2021. 

Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment four years ago:

https://preview.redd.it/cbumx113qgb81.jpg?width=654&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bba9861143359ff6b70ff0ca8e6ba75de5d00d6

The all time high for this portfolio is [October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46) (+72%).  The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down [\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).   

Remember: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.  The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.

But I didn’t stop the Experiment in 2018:  I invested another $1000 in the ***2019***, ***2020,*** and ***2021*** Top Ten Cryptos as well (***(and, just announced,*** [***again in 2022***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!)***.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?    

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48): up +34% (total value $1,341)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36) up +504% (total value $6,044)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24): up +795% (total value $8,951)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +292% (total value $3,921)

So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,257** ($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).

**That’s up +406%** on the combined portfolios, **down from** [**last month’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47) for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/xcl80o35qgb81.jpg?width=511&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2cd4923360a5492259faf606b3649c893fd4b16

***That’s a +406% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four years in a row.***

## Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  

https://preview.redd.it/3uss07c8qgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e68ae4c88a82ff35b70538ec11dd137e83447e2

After four years: the S&P 500 is up +78% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) would be worth $1,780 had it been redirected to the S&P.  That’s more than double the +34% return of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio over the same period of time.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,430** ($1,780 + $1,900 + $1,480 + $1,270)

That is up **+61%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+406%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

Here’s a fancy new chart showing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

## Conclusion:

Many thanks to the long-time Experiment followers, appreciate you taking the time to follow along over the years.  For those just getting into crypto, welcome! I hope these reports can somehow give you a taste of what you may be in for as you begin your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and try to enjoy the ride! Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for monthly progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects where I repeat the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of new sets of Top Ten cryptos as of [January 1st, 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36), [January 1st, 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24), [January 1st, 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12), and most recently, [January 1st, 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/).",6962,2022-01-13 14:11:48,1510
SOL,cryptocurrency,"For the newcomers: the top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence.","I tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
15. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
17. **Bitcoin SV (BSV)\*:** Bitcoin Scam Variant
18. **EOS (EOS):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
19. **Elrond (EGLD):** Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR)\*:** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
37. **SushiSwap (SUSHI):** a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
38. **Binance USD (BUSD):** Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.
39. **FTX Token (FTT):** It’s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.
40. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the token of Crypto.com public blockchain, that tries to enable transaction worldwide between people and businesses.
41. **Filecoin (FIL):** a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services.
42. **UMA (UMA):** it builds open-source infrastructure in order to create synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain
43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",14821,2021-02-09 12:03:25,1588

SOL,cryptocurrency,Thoughts on SOL?,"Hey folks. I originally had planned to DCA into BTC and ETH with a 50/50 split, but now I'm uncertain. Is ETH worth my time and money? I can't seem to draw a popular opinion on it just by Google searches, and digging through all the AI generated ""Ethereum in 2023"" posts that all seem to use the same linear data.

Then I thought maybe a 70/30 split with BTC and SOL could be worth doing seeing the ATH of SOL and it's current price. I bought a few, a few weeks back just to play with. It seems to be on the rise again, minus a dip here and there. What are your guys thoughts?

SOL,cryptocurrency,Reddit makes it nearly impossible for you to find coins early,"I've seen a lot of posts complaining about how r/cryptocurrency only shills stagnant coins that have already pumped. And coins like SHIB, LRC, KDA, and SOL are never mentioned until after they explode. 

This is entirely by design. Your exposure to posts on reddit is a function of how many upvotes those posts have received. And the more bagholders a particular coin has, the more upvotes. Which is why the front page is a billboard for ADA, ETH, ALGO, VET, and a handful of others. By definition, the coins you repeatedly see here already have large numbers of holders. You don't get rich buying something that everyone else already owns. Hence why projects start to stagnate when they become popular. Popularity on r/cryptocurrency is actually a great indicator for when growth can be expected to taper. Cardano is perhaps a prime example. 

By contrast, posts about undiscovered projects will almost universally be buried. There may well have been a post shilling SOL at $1 or SHIB in 2020, but they never would have made it past the last page.",5242,2021-11-09 13:47:35,2437

SOL,cryptocurrency,Save yourself trouble and just stay quiet about investing in crypto,"  

My only friend in the whole wide world just got into crypto because I told him that I made a small profit since I started. My pal went ahead and started watching bitboy-like youtubers and lost a whole lotta money. Now he is trying to blame it on me for telling him to get into crypto. 

I wholeheartedly believe that telling your friends or family about investing in crypto is just asking for trouble. Money can be evil and can destroy many things, also long-time friendships and even family. I’ve seen it before with some of my relatives and you don’t want that.

And family dinners will be far less enjoyable when crypto will dip and they will start lecturing you with “I knew that computer money is a hoax”. They don’t understand crypto. They don’t even remotely understand what it’s trying to achieve.

Keep your investments to yourself. There is no need to announce it to everyone. You don’t go around telling people how thick your wallet is right? You should stay safe. Be a Satoshi, an unknown figure from the darkness of the web. Banks and government know about you too much already, no need to give them any additional information.

SOL,cryptocurrency,Here it is. The subs most despised coins combined into a single awful folio. This is the folio of hate. How much do you want it to fail? Does it make you angry?," Well after a long and exhaustive battle of coins being shilled in just a couple of hours, I have found the list of the subs most hated coins. There was definitely a lot of hate out there. I put $100 into each and stored it on a seperate group of wallets to my real bags. To make it easier to track, I create the folio of hate using coinmarketcap to track them more easily. I'll post the updates every month and hope to see some big gains going against us all (even my most hated coin is in this group).

There was a lot of hate from users, towards some coins more so than others. The two most hated were the most hated by a very long way. Merry Christmas everyone!

The final list in order of most votes and comments is listed in the comment below because the filter won't let me create a post with that many coin names in it.

SOL,cryptocurrency,"SOL had plenty of fud, and it is flying- lessons to be learned?","Some of the first fud I knew of in crypto was how SOL would stop and restart, how it is centralized, it's just an eth knockoff.  And then the whole SBF drama came and really brought it down.  It crossed my mind that it was overblown, but I never dug deeper and looked elsewhere.

Well, it turns out that ""fud"" was opportunity staring us in the face.  And I sensed it, but didn't do the homework.

I know there's some other factors like the bonk craziness, but here's the thing.  

Every coin comes with its own set of fud. Some fud is simply made up by people to sabotage a perceived competitive threat to their bag.  Eventually reason prevails, so figuring out the fud is not justified is one opportunity.

Some fud may be very accurate, but even that often doesn't matter.

I keep adding QANX because I saw a vision that might solve a lot of the fud that's out there.  

But I've had to sort through more fud with that project than I could have ever imagined!  

I remember days selling my bag, only to keep researching, and coming back.  Usually with more conviction.  Heck, they suffered an attack and restored everyone, and since then are looking stronger than ever.  They are battle tested.  I won't go into detail, but I'm glad I stuck with it.  


Point is- don't get mad about fud. It can be opportunity staring right at you.  Good luck and I hope the whole space goes up.  Cheers

SOL,cryptocurrency,Regarding VCs in Sol and Eth,"I see a lot of people here giving Solana flack for being a VC coin, but in the early days Ethereum also got flack for being a VC coin. Now people call Ethereum the ""oil"" of cryptocurrency while BTC is gold. (I think the better analogy Eth is ""gas"" but whatever). Not to mention Eth is also getting an ETF so it shows how far this VC backed token has gone. 

ChatGPT says ""Some notable investors for Eth included Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and ConsenSys. And it raised around 18 million."" Can anyone with more braincells than me verify this? And how does this compare to Solana? 

Besides that most of the Sol tokens locked for investors have been unlocked already, VirtualBacon made a video about this. I also mentioned this earlier in the sub but I thought I'd mention it again here.

**If you bought during the bull market and are still in the red, here's what gains you need to recover for your losses:**

If  you have 50% or less in losses, at most, you'd need prices to double  from here to the next bullrun. We've seen how this volatile market does  during bull runs.

Even for people  who bought the very peak of Bitcoin, you're not even far from the  halfway point. Bitcoin just needs to break above $34K.

If  you have an alt-coin still down more than 70%, it's a big hill to  climb. The silver lining is alt-coins can have much bigger price jumps  during a bull market. If you need a 4-5x to break even, it's something  that can be realistically expected from an alt-coin in a bull market.  Even if it's a shitcoin that should have died already.

We've  seen how of the shit projects that had issues, even the ones that had  51% attacks, managed to see big rallies during bullruns.

&#x200B;

**Some of you may actually be in the green now.**

Especially if you're not new, and bought before the last bull market.

Or you may be part of a growing number of people who bought during the bear market, and are increasingly seeing more green.

Even  if you're still in the red, if you dodged most of the coins that  collapsed, the failed exchanges, the hacks, and the guy from Hyderabad  who tried to phish your private key for the 100th time, then you have  navigated your bags to the other side of this hurricane of a bear  season.",45,2023-07-10 12:58:06,116
SOL,cryptocurrency,"[Serious] SOL or ADA, I’m torn between a choice of alt coins","I’ve been reading up on more and more alt coins and more and more links have been popping up from this subreddit.
But after reading a ton of posts about alts it seems so many users are holding bags or believe in ADA.

I’m trying to go 50/50 in BTC and an alt coin and I’ve been leaning more to SOL than any other alt coin but wanted to hear others because I’m worried I’ll be convincing myself without having seen the pro’s and cons of different sides.

For SOLANA i’ve mainly seen the con being the unreliability and downtime that has occurred in the past. The pro’s are fast and low transaction fees. Also setting itself up for web 3.0 and having easy setup/connection for games and web 3.0.

It seems the Solana team have some updates in the works that should (in theory) completely eliminate the risk of downtime. Would this mean the only real con of Solana is gone? Or are there a bunch of other negatives that I’m just not seeing?

Between ADA and SOL, is one better than the other? Team behind them, applications, …?

I honestly don’t know and with the amount of people seemingly more invested in ADA I thought an earnest discussion about SOL and ADA would give some insights.
I’m mainly trying to look into alt coins which are in the top 20 market cap so perhaps other alt coins that fit that criteria are some I should look into as well? These 2 are just the ones that have drawn most of my attention.

After being on Reddit and in crypto for so long I feel a bit silly not having subbed to this subreddit sooner, apologies if this is not the correct way to post. I read the expanded rules so I hope this is ok to ask.",7,2023-08-22 02:21:47,122

SOL,cryptocurrency,"The $320m Wormhole hack was ""replenished"" by Jump Capital, an institutional trading desk/market maker (similar to Citadel) without any questions. This shows the entire Solana ecosystem is just a sham propped up by institutional entities","Yesterday, the Wormhole bridge one of Solana's biggest bridges lost $320m in a hack. Within hours, a trading desk Jump Capital agreed to replenish the entire amount so that the liquidations calamity is avoided. The loss of the peg due to the hack could have sent the network into cascading liquidations arising out of leveraged positions. In stepped a VC to save the day.

[Lost $320m? Thats fine.. we got you covered. ](https://preview.redd.it/adhsxhuefqf81.jpg?width=1172&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ed759f03c763a7cfd07d8bb35a03cff7aa3921d)

The fact that VCs are ready to cover these kind of losses shows that the entire Solana ""ecosystem"" is just one big sham propped up by these same VCs. They dont want their baby to die just yet. Apparently Jump Capital owns a significant stake in Wormhole and is ready to sink such a huge amount to cover losses. 

In Solana, the top 1.34% of addresses owns 99% of the circulating supply. Most of the supply was sold to early VCs and insiders at a massive discount to retail. Insiders and bad actors like Chamath have publicly joked about using Solana as a vehicle to play their pumps and dumps out, leaving retail to hold the bags when the sham unfolds. 

VCs dont just sink in $300m to save the day, unless they have already taken out 50x that amount - that is what Solana has enabled them to do already.

So a buncha SOL Shills be like hurr durr even ehtirium had hacks and was saved by fork. Well the DAO hack was solved by cryptography solutions (forking), not by VCs stepping into save the day. If you think both are the same, you clearly understand NOTHING about crypto whatsoever. The DAO hack and the hard fork took over a month to assess, propose solutions and resolve. It wasnt an overnight fix, like what solana is known for. 


When Solana goes down - over night fix.

When bridge hacked? - overnight fix. 

How long will Solana depend on overnight fixes to bail the network out?

Edit: The mental gymnastics of SOlshills is just incredible. They have clearly consumed all the kool aid in the world to be supportive of this kind of institution manipulation. Yes, other projects also have VCs, and Eth projects have also been hacked. Yet none of the ETH projects have been bailed out in this manner by VCs and institutions. I have been extremely critical of ETH too. There is virtually a hack a day on Eth due to poor code or implementation or bugs, but none of the ETH project hacks have been ""replenished"" by institutions. If an ETH projects gets hacked and people lose money, well you are shit out of luck. As evidenced by hundreds of hacks and scams before. 

The first major Solana hack, and less than 24 hours later the institutions propping up solana claim they are bailing everyone out. If this is not the least bit suspicious to you, then you are just being slow boiled alive. 

Solana itself is a long term pump and dump that is devoid of any decentralisation and fundamentals except a bunch of whales propping it up. The tokenomics of every single Solana ""ecosystem"" project is puke worthy - from Serum to Raydium, Bonfida, Saber etc all have massive supply in the hands of a few, an incredibly high FDV and a low float and funny unlock mechanisms - perfect conditions for institutions to keep dumping on hapless retail investors like the ones supporting Solana in the comments here who dont understand anything about crypto or finance.",4510,2022-02-04 03:17:30,1352
SOL,cryptocurrency,"Solana went down again on 4th Jan morning (UTC +8) , and was fixed early morning. Now it is back up, but shows how vulnerable this system is. A system that goes down is a death knell for serious traders","Another year.. and another episode of Solana going down.

Today it went down for a few hours in the early morning Asia time, and it took almost 4 hours to bring it back up.

As the meme goes, the D in Solana stands for decentralisation.

A network that goes down this often will never be able to attract serious traders.

Imagine you are trading on margin and get liquidated because the network was down.. this happens in centralised exchanges. Solana now natively brings this kind of user experience to the blockchain where you can experience network failure on the chain. What a wonderful innovation.

Blaming it on attackers is just dishonesty. A well designed blockchain is not supposed to have attackers, its supposed to keep producing blocks based on the parameters of the network, not take a break because someone spammed transactions.

Edit: So Sol shills have attacked this post, here is some more ""proof""

Coinbase blocked withdrawals as a result of Solana network going down

Turns out status dot solana page is lying to its own users. If you go into the Solana official groups, you can see dozens of people complaining about failing transactions, missing balances, transactions not being processed etc.

Users are repeatedly questioning the validity of the status dot solana page that shows 100% uptime even when the network was down, and even Coinbase flagged it as down.

This is why you dont use a service's own status page to come to conclusions especially if it masquerades as a decentralised blockchain, but in reality is just a glorified database.

Edit 3: This post is brigaded from the Solana sub. Hundreds of Sol shills are trying to pretend the network wasnt down. Ironically, on Sol sub itself, someone agrees that not only did the network go down, but had to be rebooted too. This is hilarious lol, the network was rebooted but status dot solana shows 100% uptime. Well played, centralised tricksters.

TL,dr? Not only did the network go down, as shown by Coinbase status and many complaints on Solana groups, the Solana devs and community managers also tried to suppress whats going on and the Solana status page flat out lies to users.

# Solana's TVL problem

Solana contracts return DROPPED errors on *50% to 80%* of all current transactions. You experience them as order delays and frustration. See for yourself at [solanabeach.io](https://solanabeach.io)

The Cause: **Low TVL + fragmented liquidity = Big slippage problems**

On Monday 3/18, SOL Dex Volume totaled $2.8B vs Ethereum's $2.0 Billion. This should be good news. But Solana's low liquidity cannot support the volume.

Poor liquidity creates added volatility and slippage fails. Solana strives to outperform Ethereum, but with only access to the equivalent of 8% of Ethereum's liquidity by contrast.

This liability remains anchored to Solana for at least another year. The unlocks are over and above scheduled inflation. It bears mentioning this 10% is now reduced to 8.2%. Money continues to *leak* from a number of mystery wallets. Still, shaking Alameda next year is a necessary step.

Even still, let's look at Solana Foundation's posted inflation schedule. You'll find that everything they claim must be verified and not taken at face-value.

>***Solana's annual inflation rate is currently 5.515% and will decrease by 15% every year.***

But how do you define a year?

Its necessary to understand Sol Foundation's answer to that stupid question. The annual numbers are based on the length of an epoch-year. An epoch-year isn't 365 days. An epoch-year is 180 epochs.

Rough formula to calculate an epoch-year.

* 1 epoch = 2.5+ days
* 180 epochs = 1 Epoch Year
* 1 Epoch Year spans 450 to 630 Earth days (dependent on the length of each epoch).

Epoch years offer flexible margins to adjust your numbers. So the 5.515% inflation rate is technically accurate. The tech-docs end with the 5 yellow-highlighted words: ***Actual inflation rate will vary.***

Its equally important to consider that inflation is the effective circulating supply. Everything that's out there! But the Solana Foundation only factors new SOL issuance used to pay validators. That's misleading, if not deceptive.

I have contacted both exchanges myself but I wont reveal more information about it.

After I collected all this information and still with panic attacks and in shock I decided to go to the police to fill a complaint about what happened so they can investigate it deeper.

In parallel to this process, I tried to recover my Google account with all the 2FA existing methods but it was impossible due to a really bad Google Customer Support (non existent) and because the hacker achieved to make Google believe that he was me. I contacted also multiple customers supports, all of them better than Google ones and I have been slowly recovering all my accounts (It took a week... and still waiting for some).

# 13/08/2024: Second police complaint

I filled another complaint in another type of police with the same information.

**Advice:** When filling a complaint, write everything that happened in a file or paper with as much as details and crypto terms as possible because the person that will attend you will know shit about fuck and it will be hard to fill a good report that the specialist will understand easier.

# 13/08/2024 -16/08/2024: Accounts recoveries and security increase

First of all, I have to say that I use Bitwarden as password manager and I believe he didn't got access to it. However I decided to reset everything from scratch and start using those unique generated passwords.

During this week, I have been recovering my accounts everywhere (a pain in the ass to demonstrate that the account belongs to you) and refreshing my password security measures.

Furthermore, I decided to use only crypto in my not personal laptop that will only have access to Internet when I really need it.

# 16/08/2024 - Cockroaches Everywhere

Some of you will think that after losing a lot and being hacked life will give you a break, well, you are wrong.

Some days after I got hacked a good exRedditor zoomer made and shared an analysis about the hack in Twitter. You can read it here (https://x.com/ZoomerXBT/status/1823438152394055994), I really suggest you to do it.

Well, after that post and saying it was me some accounts, suggested me to contact a crypto recovery expert. At that moment I was bored so I decided to play along. Well as you can imagine in less than 30 minutes they recovered all my coins /S

Anyway, something funny I noticed during that joke and make them lose time process is that even thought I was 100% sure that they were trying to scam me, my brain was intrusively sending me thoughts about ""What if you dont know enough about crypto and they can?"". Crazy right? Well, just a hint. If they could, whole crypto would worth 0 xD

# Personal Opinions and Feelings

**Hack**

Regarding the hack, as you may imagine, I have been trying to understand everything but I still dont know how he managed to get each of the passwords because my wallets app were closed. Those passwords had a pattern but they were different so somehow he managed to get one and deducted the rest. I still don't know how because as far as I know I didn't have any of them saved in the browser or in the computer. Big mystery that I will never know and that I am trying to not think about for my own mental health.

**Feelings**

I don't know from where start. I cant barely remember the hack day and the following days. I have been in a roller coaster of emotions that I wouldn't wish even to my worst enemy. I tried to analyze multiple times my own feelings, why and categorize them and this is what I take in clear from it:

* **Insecurity and fear:** After losing my Google account, crypto, etc. I feel insanely insecure and with a lot of fear. Whatever delayed email notification about configuration changes triggers my anxiety to the roof.
* **FOMO:** I feel that I have lost my one in a life time opportunity that I had in my own hands, so close, but now so far. My brain still sends me signals to degen into it, this is where FOMO comes in.
* **Zombie:** The whole week I have been feeling like a zombie, wondering, trying to find out what to do next. Still trying to find out my next roadmap but already being built.
* **\[Insert whatever bad feeling comes to your mind\]**

Regarding my current state, well, I have developed some sort of PTSD that I am working on and will work with my psychologist. Now I am stable most of the times but I suddenly cry with no apparent reason and also sometimes some words or things triggers my feelings regarding the hack too. Can't say much, first time experiencing something that is pushing me out of my known limits.

**Advice**

* Use a password manager like Bitwarden and use one different password per site.
* Dont use the Sign in with Google feature in some sites. Depending how they are developed you will have no way to recover that account because you have no access due to no password.
* Enable every 2FA measures as possible.
* Have emails for everything. Some only for CEXs, others for social, other for shops, etc. I also suggest having a recovery Google account for example that will only get recovery emails and also be linked to other Google Drive for example. I say this because I have lost some important data but if you share all those files with other account you still have access and download it in case someone really steals your Google account.
* Configure a device for only crypto use and never use crypto in your personal devices. Maybe only with another layer of hot wallets.
* Ask for help, before it is too late.

# Acknowledgments

I have to thank all those people who have helped me both to gather information and to try to encourage me. We all know that words can't help and fix much but just the gesture of checking on someone if he is doing fine after a really traumatic event can really help. Every ""penny"" counts right?

For this reason again, I have to thank you all, you helped me to stay above the water and I will always be grateful for it.

Thanks again, Kirt.",623,2024-08-19 06:32:10,600

SOL,cryptocurrency,BTC is down 1.6% over the last 7 days but Alts are experiencing a blood bath.,"Grandpa BTC had a little bit of a slip today and with that ALTS by and large decided it was time to bleed out in the streets.

BTC is down 1.6% over the last 7 days. But if you look at Alts it's a whole different story.

Sol down 14% in seven days, Cardano 16%, BCH 22%, ARB 22%, Algo 20%. In fact the majority of ALTS in the top 100 are down 15% or more compared to BTC down a measly 1.6%.

It's tempting to look at this and think well Alts are up from their bear market lows so they're doing ok...  But compare ALTS to their alt/btc pair and you see a completely different picture.

Algorand just hit a new ATL against BTC.

SOL,cryptocurrency,Bonk could be just exit liquidity for SOL VCs,"Hello together,

I have the tinfoil hatty theory, that BONK might be marketed and ""invented"" by SOL venture capitalists who need exit liquidity.

For them the expenses are easily covered and a social media spam campaign doesn't cost much anyway. Copy paste some token and rename it, done.

The super artificial marketing and that the token came out of nowhere without further information or pre marketing, makes me believe that.

I really don't want to ruin anyones gains or something. I might be completely wrong and BONK is a serious meme token as far as this is possible :) 

But I thibk this theory isn't even too far fetched. 

Any thoughts on this?",67,2023-01-06 13:31:53,108
SOL,cryptocurrency,"Unpopular opinion - Is CoinBureau unbiased or his opinions in last video about ALGO vs. SOL are affected, because he is SOL holder?","Hey Guys,

To be clear - I like CoinBureau. Till now, he was the best source of unbiased info about crypto and blockchains for me, but his last video ""SOLANA vs. ALGORAND"" made me think about it.

Link to video - [Solana vs. Algorand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzucrCRGYkM)

I like both chains, I hold bags of both and I do believe both of them have great future (even with latest SOL issue), but I think that his last video is not unbiased at all. I get it, it´s difficult, when you have to be unbiased, when you are holding one of these coins, but since he has a lot of followers and huge influence, he should be extracareful. I will still follow him, because I like him, BUT I think we should look at these two ALGO misconceptions:

**Misc 1 - Algorand staking:**

*""Staking SOL is much easier to do""* \- At first I´ve thought I´ve heard it wrong, so I´ve had to rewind it. It looks like sending Algo to native wallet, where it´s automatically staked is somehow more difficult than sending it into wallet and immediatelly receiving rewards, choosing a validator, amount to participate and waiting for 5 day (lock up period). I do not understand how Guy came to this conclusion. Algo has the easiest staking mechanism I´ve seen do far, so I do not agree with this statement at all (and I am not the only one according to discussion under video).

**Misc 2 - Accelerated vesting:**

According to info from Algorand Foundation, accelerated vesting already ended on 5th of October (source - [The Accelerated vesting)](https://algorand.foundation/news/accelerated-vesting-complete). I kinda get it, because video was posted on 7th of October, so two days after, but this was mentioned in almost every ALGO analysis I´ve read/seen - ""Bad tokenomics"". I do not think Algo Tokenomics is bad compared to SOL (where they released shitload of coins from day to day, but somehow it did not affected price...God knows why. To me it looks a bit fishy and I see it as bigger problem than Algo and their exact plan, but whatever).

**Conclusion:**

I like CoinBureau. Guy and his team are making great videos and I will still follow him, but this is something I strongly disagree with, because both points are incorrect. I am wandering if it´s because he did´t knew about it, or because he is holding SOL and do not hold ALGO. In my opinion Algo´s biggest issue - accelerated vesting, is actually a bonus. It was planed, everyone knew about it, they were slowly releasing coins to circulation to avoid pumps and sumps, so I do not see a problem here and staking is...just try to stake Algo yourself:). On the other hand I appreciate that Guy mentioned other pros and cons of both coins:). This video won´t change my opinion on these two chains and I will still hold both.

P.S.: Now you can downvote me to oblivion:).",118,2021-10-08 06:46:23,151

SOL,cryptocurrency,Two members of the Trump Family were just hacked on Twitter and just pulled off an elaborate scam. ,"Members of the Trump family are currently in the process of launching a defi platform ""World Liberty Financial"".

They haven't released any information about what the defi platform would entail so when two members of the Trump family got hacked. Scammers were able to pull off an elaborate scam by pretending to release information on the project and directed people to buy the token.

The Scam announcement Tweets:

https://preview.redd.it/4fc0sxe38pmd1.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=56a48f05c3500ce20045e3404b88a14bec90bc4f

This second Tweet was meant to add additional believability by coming from a second member of the Trump family

The website that was linked had a token address listed and looked like:

Apparently the only thing you needed to do to be part of the defi revolution was load up a wallet with SOL and then purchase the token. That's it.... **The 1,2,3 steps on the website might be the dumbest part of the entire scam.**

After the announcement post the two hacked accounts shilled the tokens hard on X claiming to be related to the Trump org and warned others to watch out for scams pretending to be World Liberty Financial.

In this tweet the scammer cleverly links the telegram channel with the website thereby claiming legitimacy by association.

Roughly 40 minutes after the scammers took over the two accounts Eric Trump finally managed to tell people that the relentless shilling from the two hacked accounts were in fact a scam.

All the above Tweets have since been removed by Twitter support.

I will update with how much the scammers made once I know more.

It could be some AI crypto, metaverse or whatever, but I thing I am certain that people will throw their money at:

Do you remember last bullrun, when people were hyping coins like Cardano ADA, Harmony ONE, NEAR protocol, Algorand ALGO and many others; some of them called themselves or are called ""ETH-killer"" by their followers.

The crypto industry is still evolving, faster, more secure, cheaper(and hopefully more decentralized) cryptocurrency are being developed.
It's natural that something better is being invented.

Currently Solana is the first 'super fast' crypto and competitors want to take over.

Not advising others to hunt for the next 'SOL-killer', but for me this feels like a good bet to start investing a little bit of money (you can afford to lose).

SOL,cryptocurrency,"A Balanced Portfolio Should Consist of at least 70% BTC, 60% ETH, 30% top 15 alts, 20% stables, and 10% low cap","I’ve been seeing a lot of people post about adding BTC and ETH to their portfolio and asking questions how they should split up their portfolio. In this thread, I will share my experience on the perfect breakdown. 

To start, you want at least 70% in BTC. This is the granddaddy of all coins and your most stable. The higher the percentage of BTC, the better.

Next is ETH, I’ve found 60% is a good level. Even if you just have BTC and ETH, you will have 130% of your portfolio in 2 coins, up for 100% you started with. To instantly have 30% more, you are genius. 

Next up is the large-cap alts. I like 30% here. You can LRDYOR (let Redditors do your own research) to decide which coin is best for you, but possible examples are SOL, ADA, DOT, LINK, AVAX, etc. Following advice up to this point, you have at least 160% portfolio. 

Keeping 20% stables is key to any portfolio. You can earn interest (up to 20%) on stables, plus any price action. I saw one tik-tok’er predict Tether would go to $5 this year. I think that’s bullish, but I can easily see USDT going to $3. Let’s say you earn 20% interest on your 20% investment, you now have 40% (compounding interest works wonders). Now your portfolio allocation is at 200% and you have doubled your money. 

Now that you have doubled your money, going for 100% portfolio allocation to 200%, you have freedom to gamble on low cap coins. I’d keep this to 10%. 

This strategy will work for everyone. It will instantly turn you into a billionaire overnight. Follow me for more financial advice.",2589,2022-03-02 12:21:05,959
SOL,cryptocurrency,I have analyzed EVERY SHILLED COIN in this sub from 2017 to 2021 and here is the summary,"Some **important notes** about analysis   
1. Analysis was done from **1st of January** of each corresponding year till **31st of December** of the same year

2. **KSM**, **AMP**, **SHIBA** *ICO* price was not found, therefore the *ICO* price was used from the earliest historical data from ***CoinMarketCap/CoinGecko***

3. ***n/a*** means that a coin was **not released** that year

4. If a coin was released, for example, in **July 1st 2018**, then the analysis of that year was done from *the date of ICO till 31st of December of the same year*

5. Coins were sorted from the most ***ROI*** from the *ICO* date till **30th of October 2021**
6. Bitcoin didn't have ICO, ICO in the table for BTC means the first day you could have bought it, which was $1 for 1309 BTC, same with XRP, Uniswap, Monero, they had no ICO

https://imgur.com/a/AKG8M1e

Key takeaways

1. **Bitcoin** has the most ***ROI*** from *ICO* date, but compared to other coins, gives less **ROI** each year, still a solid investment
2. **Ethereum** gives better returns than **Bitcoin**, but is worse in ***Bear Market***
3. **Shiba Inu** has pumped only this year. In **2020** it **lost value significantly**, which means maybe after this bull run, it won't give any ROI anymore. Still hard to analyze with only 1 year of history
4. **Axie Infinity, Solana, Kusama,  Polkadot, Helium, Aave, Avalanche, Pancakeswap, Uniswap, Sushiswap, Injective Protocol, Arweave** all were *ICOed* in 2020, and in a span of ***1,5 years*** they gave insane returns, if they continue with the same pace, you can ***10x*** your money in the future
5. ~~**AMP** *ICOed* in 2020 and is ***the only coin*** in this table that gave ***consistent negative returns***~~
6. Our beloved **Algorand** have a negative ***ROI*** from the *ICO*, but if you were buying the dip, you should be good
7. **Litecoin** is like a little brother of Bitcoin that doesn't get any toys. It gives consistent positive ROI but compared to others, it is really little return
8. **Technically almost every coin has pumped at least 500% this year**

EDIT1: NANO price was 0 at ICO in 2015,  this means the return is infinite. But there was a cap for how much you could have gotten, in the evening I’ll fix it, we would count it as it was ICOED at 0.001

EDIT2: Nano ROI was fixed

However, we now know that there is a letter of intent for Binance to buy FTX. Given an apparent cease fire, I would think that the cascade would slow down and there would be some calm restored to Solana price action. 

But markets continue to go down. 

SOL is now down about 25% in 24 hours. 

Do you think there is a delayed reaction to news on the letter of intent?  Or people don’t think the deal will go through and continue to dump?  Or do people just think SOL is hot garbage and are selling it to sell?

Position disclosure:  I know it has its problems, but I do carry a small bag of SOL in case the sun rises bright on the next bull market. I bought some at 25% off on the continued dump after the LOI news.",14,2022-11-08 18:21:17,110
SOL,cryptocurrency,"Scammed for $20k, seeking advice on what went wrong","A scammer gained access to two of my wallets and within 5 minutes, managed to drain about $20K worth of coins (at the time).

I know I'm at fault here, but I'm trying to learn from this. I'm aware I can kiss these coins goodbye.

What baffles me is how they accessed not one, but two of my different seed phrases.

Some of my suspicions:

1. The seed phrases were stored in 1Password (I know, stupid, it's now fixed). However, there were other seeds in there for wallets containing about $5K, which the scammer didn't touch. Why would they leave those?
2. 10 days earlier, I used portalbridge.com to bridge ETH to SOL. But I confirmed it was legit, and only connected one of the compromised wallets.
3. Hours before the hack, I used \[this guide\]([https://shoprestatement.com/blog/how-to-block-fast-fashion-brands-from-google-shopping-search-results/#paste-this-code](https://shoprestatement.com/blog/how-to-block-fast-fashion-brands-from-google-shopping-search-results/#paste-this-code)) to filter some Google Shopping search results using uBlock Origin, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary.
4. I had some apps cracked by m0nkrus, but they are considered legit as far as community trust goes. Also, these were installed quite some time ago.

Here's a breakdown of the transactions that occurred during the scam:

 \#  Wallet 1a (ETH): 0xdcD7F0CC4B01d02Ab3963270F0Dd242ee2108d6C

* 2.92 ETH stolen and transferred to 0xAfFD49F769F2Afc92b98C0BcAE86FBFb567f8F6D, then moved to FixedFloat (0x4E5B2e1dc63F6b91cb6Cd759936495434C7e972F).
* 1,456.38 AGRS and 0.019 ETH stolen and transferred to 0x9a49DD07481B3B6e6452F7970CfE9Bfb12F234D6, where they currently remain.

 \#  Wallet 1b (BNB): 0xdcD7F0CC4B01d02Ab3963270F0Dd242ee2108d6C

124,583.39 SAITO and 55.44 XCAD swapped for 4.02 BNB via 0x1a1ec25DC08e98e5E93F1104B5e5cdD298707d31, then 4.49 BNB transferred to  0x9a49DD07481B3B6e6452F7970CfE9Bfb12F234D6.

 \#  Wallet 2 (BNB): 0x805b2c2012f5Ea9607f4F2B8F8BeAdD126D10c7b

52,665.91 SAITO swapped for 1.59 BNB, which was then transferred to  0x9a49DD07481B3B6e6452F7970CfE9Bfb12F234D6.

The BNB from Wallet 1b and Wallet 2 was consolidated in 0x9a49DD07481B3B6e6452F7970CfE9Bfb12F234D6, and 6 BNB were moved to 0x6297EC9F725919A5FD2ca95240f59e09585871dA, before being transferred to a FixedFloat hot wallet (0x4727250679294802377dD6cA6541B8E459077c9).

\---

The address 0x1a1ec25DC08e98e5E93F1104B5e5cdD298707d31 appears to be a contract linked to ongoing scams, judging from the comments posted on it, but I wasn't able to infer anything from these.

I've also filed a police report and reached out to FixedFloat. They've responded that they can investigate the scammer's server and order logs, potentially retrieving the IP address and other identifying details.

Any help would be appreciated!",982,2023-12-11 18:02:45,596
SOL,cryptocurrency,"Why is Grayscale GDLC dumping 20%? ""Digital Large Cap"" - 67% BTC, 25% ETH, 3% SOL","I get people want to rotate out of GBTC into the ETF, but GDLC ""Digital Large Cap Fund"" (67% BTC, 25% ETH, 3% SOL, 2.5% XRP, 1.5% ADA, 1% ADA) is trading at a 50% discount and still dumping? It's the only way to get ETH and SOL into a standard portfolio, seems like a bargain?   Wondering if I should buy more or is wise to get out if it's reacting negatively to the ETF approval?  ETH ETF is a lot more complex with staking and ICO so it's not a sure thing for April at all, but should get approval eventually.  This was an interesting interview about ETF impact, ETH starts at 29:00. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxvWd8qpV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxvWd8qpV8)

SOL,cryptocurrency,I don't understand how people continue to use Solana when it's team is literally known liars.,"I don't know about you but trust is a massive thing for me. Especially when it comes to the products I use and invest in. They have lied about their circulating supply TWICE and have blatantly committed fraud. Their responses to this was literally just a ""whoops, well looks like you caught us"". This is an absolute joke in my eyes. 

I have literally sold all my SOL, I've bought a bag of MATIC and I'm never going back. It's more decentralized (SOL has proven to be extremely centralized), The team can actually be trusted and it's just an overall better chain IN MY OPINION. 

Yes I know Solana has a higher market cap but I feel like in the long term, Polygon will be flipping it. Are you really so obsessed with making a quick buck that you'd invest in a project who's developers have blatantly lied to your face and have disrespected you on multiple occasions? I don't know about you but I'm not about that life. Respect yourselves, They only get away with this crap if we let them.",2249,2021-12-13 10:05:15,1325
SOL,cryptocurrency,FTX Token ( FTT ) just dumped -25% -400 Million in market cap," 

Something is going on right now. FTT is dumping heavily. We've all heard about the drama lately around FTX and while lots of rumors have been going around the charts are pretty clear.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ay1gbiehbny91.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=50e500aa1cb1da7678e80c1c35cb3fd80e7a9951

As I'm writing this post right now it is falling off a cliff we've seen before with a .... similar crypto.  
Now I generally don't want to spread panic and remind everybody that it's outside of NA & EU trading hours so the volume is pretty low. But this is still a MASSIVE dump.

**Solana is also dumping heavily**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o2jr2apibny91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1bed2161a3b6a07e3d1bd31a16b23ed1007bd30

I've seen theories that FTX / Alameda research dump their Solana to cover losses in FTX. It would explain why SOL has been falling off a cliff lately as well.

FTT lost the 22$ support. Some might remember this chart I've posted before that this is where major support held the price this year. It just fell through like it's nothing.

SOL,cryptocurrency,"Long - If you had to pick 3 to prioritize over the rest, and invest your hard earned time and money, which would you choose, and why? ADA, AMP, ALGO, DOT, LRC, MANA, MATIC, SOL or XLM? No apex, no meme.","See below for my thoughts on each. Please share your reasoning along w your choices. 

Limited to assets commonly available in the US. This is a discussion about long term plays. Not interested in quick pumps or reckless gambling. 

I’ve determined that this list (along with ETH) have strong cases for support. I’d love to hear from the community about their research, beliefs, and projections. Please include your thoughts and encourage discussion!

I’m genuinely interested in disruptive, innovative technology. I invested in TSLA, MRNA, and big tech like BABA and Amazon. I just never went in hard enough to make life changing gains. Now, with more financial security, I want to put some weight behind the projects with the best long term potential. 

My brief thoughts:

ADA: Hoskinson, PoS, interesting prospects for smart contracts and DApps. I like that it was designed to solve business challenges and not necessarily “for the cause”. Downside, trading down past month, hasn’t really broken open in functional uses.

AMP: Cheap entry point, novel solution concept, could grow 4-5x. Downside, the team clearly doesn’t know how to sell the real world usage opportunities, probably never going to be a $1 token. 

ALGO: Silvio Micali is a Touring award winning professor who is an expert in most things I don’t understand. Can easily gain interest, PoS, cheap to buy, will almost certainly double in value, could be a real foundational part of the future of finance. Downside, trading sideways at a slight decrease for a bit, website hurts my eyes, probably not a 10x gain from here on. 

DOT: Gavin Wood, PoS, has some buzz after posting all time highs, some projections have it 2, 3, 4, even 5x from here. Focus on solving actual problems, scalability, no forks. Better web and marketing than some. Is this really Web 3.0 tech? Downside, pricey compared to some other options, could be buying at the top, hard to change the world. 

LRC: Layer 2 solution to some of Ethereum’s big problems. Price predictions on this are not great, but some say 3x in 5 yrs and maybe even as high as $10 down the road. Now, if the GME thing happens and retail investors from WSB pile on, it could spike quite dramatically. Faster, cheaper transactions than pushing to ETH directly. Downside: could be a disaster, could be buying near the ATH right now, homepage of website sucks, price spiked but is retracting, now with majority Sell sentiment. 

MANA: Crazy ride over the past week and month. I’m too old to understand what Decentraland is… as are many heavy investors and institutions, which could turn them completely off from investing in MANA. Or, we could be looking at the beginning of all those near-future movies where people prefer the virtual world to the real one. Could be a 3x return in 12-18 months, or could zero out. Idfk 

MATIC: as stated on their site “solves pain points associated with Blockchains, like high gas fees and slow speeds, without sacrificing security.” Sounds great to me. A bit mediocre this week w a balanced buy:sell ratio. Since its spike in price, could be buying near the top. Could be worth $10 in 5 years, could be worth $100 in 20 yrs… or could drop 50% next month, or worse - zero out because if Ethereum isn’t the future, neither is MATIC. 

SOL: Pricey compared to some others. Competitor of Ethereum, faster and cheaper. Cool website, like their video, nice marketing. Built to solve real problems. Rapidly growing. 2x growth likely. 3x in 5 years? Probably more. Lots of bulls here. Other than the fact that ETH is just so much more powerful in the market right now, I don’t see a lot of downside to SOL (I actually bought 4 more while I wrote this). 

XLM: the Stellar concept is fascinating. Could it be the future of global commerce and finance? I love the idea that it can focus on developing economies and how it performs forex exchanges. But what is the benefit of XLM itself on the Stellar network if you can use essentially anything on it? Almost dead after a horrific 90% plummet a couple of years ago. It could double in a month or it could once again lose almost everything. Could it be a $2 asset in 5 years? If it’s a 5x return in 5 years, great. From what I understand, As long as Ripple is engaged w the SEC, XRP remains suppressed so XLM has room to breathe. 

EDIT: Please include some of your reasoning along with your 3, and if you respect the research into each of these, please throw the homie some love. 

My current positions: Total crypto portfolio a little over (edit: removed value as suggested)

I hold a little of all of these, a decent amount of DOGE, and a handful of ETH. 

No BTC at all because of a psychological block on buying so high. I didn’t have the available cash to buy when it was recently 30-40k. 

Yes, Doge. Say what you will, but Elon has done very well by me so far and I’m going to trust in him until he lets me down.",75,2021-11-06 19:45:40,126
SOL,cryptocurrency,You remember when Solana was the next big thing and it turned out the team were just massive liars and were committing fraud? A lesson in doing your own research and not buying into hype.,"For those of you who may be new to the whole crypto thing, Solana was all the rage last year. People and VCs were incredibly high on this chain like it was the next best thing since sliced bread. Well surprise surprise. Not only did Solana turn out to be INCREDIBLY centralized, the team lied about their circulating supply twice and were caught committing fraud. That's a big yikes from me.

 I have literally sold all my SOL,  I've bought a bag of MATIC and I'm never going back. It's more  decentralized (SOL has proven to be extremely centralized), The team can  actually be trusted and it's just an overall better chain IN MY  OPINION. I know a lot of you apes are pretty much gambling and will invest into anything even if it's a shitcoin. That's not me though and that shouldn't be you either.

This chain CANNOT compete with the likes of Ethereum and L2s like Polygon. Especially when Solana is a project that has literally lied to you and disrespected you straight to your face. A real shame that people will still invest in this because y'all have no self respect lmao.

Anyway I went off on a bit of a rant but the point of my post is this. Do your own research, do consistent research and tune out all the noise you're going to be hearing. Forget about marketing and hype. You will avoid most of this game's pitfalls by doing your own research. The most important skill you're ever going to use is tuning out noise and research.",2118,2022-03-09 13:01:54,1122

SOL,cryptocurrency,"The top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence: the updated version","It's been 6 months since my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lg1yhv/for_the_newcomers_the_top_50_cryptocurrencies/) trying to sum up the biggest cryptos in a few words. I feel like an updated version is long due and so here we are.

As usual, if something is wrong or you would like to make a correction, feel free to comment. It's obviously hard to sum up each project in a few words, but I tried my best.

Terms used:

* If I refer to layer-2 solutions, that means a protocol or framework built on top of an existing blockchain and trying to increase transaction speed or scaling.
* [PoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work): Proof of Work
* [PoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake): Proof of Stake

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009 and since then it has become much more of a Store of Value than a currency, given its scarcity and high security, although layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network allows for fast and cheap transactions.
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** the coin of the Ethereum blockchain, the first smart contract platform and the one having the biggest ecosystem of decentralized applications around: since ETH price is used to pay fees to interact with the network, a bigger ecosystem means higher demand. It is (and will be) used for staking in Ethereum 2.0 (which is PoS).
3. **Tether (USDT):** the most discussed stablecoin around, pegged to the dollar price although many believe it is not fully backed: for this reason its market cap has been decreasing for the first time ever and other stablecoins are gaining traction.
4. **Binance Coin (BNB):** the official Binance coin and the one used to pay fees on the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain like Ethereum but less decentralized and with cheaper fees (not counting any layer 2 solutions).
5. **Cardano (ADA):** the coin of the PoS blockchain Cardano, created by the Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and developed strictly following peer-reviewed research, which slowed down development. Lots of partnerships and a big community make it one of the biggest ETH contenders.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** a centralized coin trying to redefine online payments, has had a rough time after the SEC went after it but seemingly it's coming out on top.
7. **USD Coin (USDC):** another stablecoin tied to the dollar and managed by the company Circle. Considered more trustworthy than Tether, it's been growing non-stop adoption-wise.
8. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** such wow, even higher ranking than last time. *sigh*
9. **Polkadot (DOT):** it's the coin of Polkadot, a multichain protocol aiming to connect different chains, both public and private, allowing to transfer data between one another or to create new custom blockchains. ChainLink's oracle pallet and Kusama are examples of projects built on top of it.
10. **Binance USD (BUSD):** another stablecoin pegged to the dollar, managed by Binance in partnership with Paxos.
11. **Uniswap (UNI):** the first token on the list, it's used to govern the decentralized trading protocol Uniswap, probably the biggest and most known DeFi application built on Ethereum.
12. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** a fork of Bitcoin trying to increase scalability and lower transaction fees increasing the blockchain block size, which achieves these features but reduces [decentralization](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f32dac47-a7a6-4e5d-af5b-28e4f1d87287).
13. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin younger brother, been around since 2011. It's based on the Bitcoin code but with some tweaks, lowering transaction speed and cost, many sees it as the ""silver"" of crypto since it's been around for so long.
14. **Chainlink (LINK):** between one Ganon and the other Link is also the official token of ChainLink, a network that basically bridges off-chain data with smart contracts: an example is Synthetix, a derivatives protocol that uses Chainlink to get the price feed of a certain asset on their smart contract.
15. **Solana (SOL):** one of the latest Ethereum contenders, launched in 2020 and offering possibly the highest layer-1 thoughput of all (50k transaction per second!), but is still somewhat centralized (although this is being addressed) and has yet to build a competitive ecosystem.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** it's a tokenized version of Bitcoin so it can be used on the Ethereum network and in DeFi applications.
17. **Polygon (MATIC):** the most popular layer-2 solution for Ethereum, Matic is the official coin of Polygon and used to pay fees on it: many Ethereum applications are moving there but it's still not easy to use with few exchanges supporting it directly.
18. **Ethereum Classic (ETC):** native token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain, a hard fork of Ethereum that claims to be more tied to Ethereum original plan. It has suffered various 51% attacks in the past years.
19. **Stellar (XLM):** created by an ex-Ripple founder, its aim is to become a currency and to allow to trade assets in a cheap and fast way. Last time I joked it was a 40c stablecoin, now I wished that held true.
20. **THETA (THETA):**  The token of THETA, a decentralized video delivery network (in a p2p fashion), used mainly for governance.
21. **DAI (DAI):** the biggest stablecoin not pegged 1-to-1 (or at least not claiming to) to the dollar, but soft-pegged and using cryptocurrencies deposited in smart contracts to collaterize the newly minted tokens.
22. **Internet Computer (ICP):** after its disastrous launch earlier this year, it almost overthrew Dogecoin as the biggest meme in the space. Jokes aside, it's a blockchain aiming to revolutionize the current internet, claiming to run at the same speed as the current web.
23. **VeChain (VET):**  Once everyone's favorite coin in this sub, was hit hard in the May crash and only lately recovering. Vechain is a blockchain focusing on business use-cases and supply chain management, VET (and VTHO) are the blockchain's official coins.
24. **Filecoin (FIL):**  the most popular IPFS (Interplentary File System), a peer-to-peer storage network without having to rely on cloud storage companies.
25. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron's founder Justin Sun is like Jian-Yang, great at repackaging other projects (thanks to u/fbslo on the last post). Jokes aside, it's a blockchain platform for decentralized applications more focused on content sharing and entertainment.
26. **Monero (XMR):**  Monero's goal is  to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, Monero obscures even senders and recipients whereas BTC doesn't. 
27. **Aave (AAVE):** a lending-borrowing decentralized protocol on Ethereum (and Polygon), the AAVE token grants discounted fees on the platform and act as a governance token.
28. **TERRA (LUNA):** Terra is a blockchain protocol offering a variety of applications, from stablecoins to synthetic assets and stocks. LUNA is the native token used to stabilize the price of UST (the TERRA stablecoin) and peg it to the dollar, and can be used to pay fees on the network.
29. **EOS (EOS):** another PoS blockchain launched in 2018, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It is designed to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology. 
30. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the native token of the Crypto.com chain and the Crypto.com exchange. Similar to the BNB token, it is closely tied to the success of the exchange.
31. **AMP (AMP):** it's an Ethereum token and it's used as collateral on the Flexa network, covering any financial transactions that fail if the need arises.
32. **Axie Infinity (AXS):** without a doubt the most popular blockchain game, a mix of Pokémon and Tamagotchi that follows the Play-To-Earn model. AXS is the token used for governance and soon staking.
33. **PancakeSwap (CAKE):** the most popular decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain, it started off as a copy of the Uniswap AMM model to then provide a variety of services.
34. **FTX Token (FTT):** the native token of the FTX platform, specialized in trading derivatives. It can be used as collateral or for discounts on trading fees.
35. **Bitcoin BEP2 (BTCB):** another tokenized version of Bitcoin, this time on the Binance Smart Chain.
36. **The Graph (GRT):**  It is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS like Filecoin. Basically simplyfing the retrieval of data on blockchains for developers and applications.
37. **Algorand (ALGO):** founded by the MIT professor Silvio Micali, it's a PoS blockchain supporting smart contracts, with low fees and high throughput of operations.
38. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):**  A utility token related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex. 
39. **Maker (MKR):** Maker is a token on the ethereum blockchain use for governance of the MakerDAO and Maker protocol, the organization behind the DAI stablecoin.
40. **Cosmos (ATOM):** dubbed the ""internet of blockchains"" by its founders, it solves the problem of interoperability between blockchains and provides tools to developers to build their own blockchains. Atom is the coin powering the platform and some notable projects built on top of it are Terra and Crypto.com chain.
41. **SHIBA INU (SHIB):** a meme coin that exploded in May, recently ShibaSwap was launched to give some sort of use-case to the coin which got a 3% score by DeFi Safety (later updated to 35%).
42. **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** a hard fork of a hard fork (BCH), it claims to be the true Satoshi Nakamoto vision of Bitcoin with an even bigger block size. Can't come up with a better joke than last time, I'm sorry.
43. **Tezos (XTZ):** another PoS Ethereum competitor. XTZ is the official coin used for governance and staking. One characteristic is that it is unforkable: it's impossible to create duplicates as instead happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum.
44. **Klaytn (KLAY):** a blockchain using a hybrid design between public and private chains, allowing anyone to create their own chain easily and without any technical knowledge, trying to appeal to companies and institutions mainly.
45. **NEO (NEO):**  *Noone can be told what it is, you'll have to see if for yourself.* Just kidding: launched in early 2014, it's a blockchain not too different from Ethereum where NEO is the coin used for governance. It has a Smart Economy System using digital assets (linked to a physical one) and verificable digital identities on smart contracts.

And then, there’s my granma. Oh my she’s so cool guys, ofc I love her! When I talked to her about cryptocurrencies and BTC, 2 years ago, she said: «I don’t understand how this works, but you seem so excited about this, and young generations are always right in this stuff».

She went to her bedroom and said:«wait, I want you to do one thing»

She returned with 100€: «I want you to go to the bank and buy some crypto». She clearly had no idea that you could do things with money outside a bank influence. Of course I took those money as cash for myself but I invested 100$ in a new wallet.

It was 2019, I bought ADA at 0.0352. I left it there and this year I sold them at 2$. 6000$ from 100€.

Why? My grandma is not feeling well, and could not be able to walk soon. But mentally she’s fine. I wanted to show that she was right in trusting me.

I was so proud of myself, and after various whitdrawals from exchanges I had almost 5200€ in my account. I wanted to give 5000€ cash to grandma, as she did to me, and take 200€ for myself as “consulence”. Lol. So in the last two and a half months I took cash 500€ weekly and last sunday I went to her. She remembered those 100€ when I talked to her, and after she saw 5000€ she couldn’t believe her eyes. I lended the money to her and she only took 500€ for her and then she gave back to me 4500€: «go to the bank and buy more “crittusoddi” (=cryptocurrency in our dialect, I think she invented a new word lol), but this time don’t come back with money». This week I invested 500€ in 9 different projects: DOT, LUNA, SOL, CRO, GALA, CKB, XRD, ALGO and ONE. I left them in my “grandma wallet”, and I hope in two years from now they will increase in value and I could still show them to her, to feel like this again.

* **Star Atlas Game**  
Star Atlas is a  competitor for Axie Infinity, promising to provide a triple-A gaming  experience and offering supper high-quality cinematic game visuals.  Earlier this year they released the triple IDO (Initial Decentralized  Offer) which sent this network and Atlas, the in-game currency and  POLIS, the governing token around 150 times higher. But star atlas has  much more potential. Star Atlas can be described as a combination of NFT with the gaming industry using the concept of the  metaverse.  
The idea is to monetize the time spent playing the game. Gamers can collect NFT’s and sell them for real cash in the Star  Atlas marketplace. This ecosystem comes with a deflationary mechanism,  by losing your NFT spaceships if you engage and lose in a battle. 80% of  the Atlas tokens will be rewarded to successful players, while after  selling 20% of the Polis coins, the rest will be distributed to the DAO.  You can also lend both tokens on different pools on Radium, which is  the next top Solana-based project.
* Raydium  
Raydium  is a market maker just like Uniswap built on Solana. It has the highest  TVL (Total Value Locked) on Solana with $12.6 billion. What makes  Radium stand aside is the fact that the other DEX and DeFi  (Decentralized Finance) suffer from two main issues: one, most exchanges  are based on the Ethereum network which means network congestion and  high gas fees, and two, and they can access liquidity only within their  pools.  
Raydium can overcome these challenges by incorporating  Serum on the Solana blockchain, which is the first AMM (Automated Market  Maker) that optimizes the speed of the Solana network and the DEX limit  order book, meaning endless liquidity supply, friction less yield  farming and speed token swaps. With the Serum connection from Raydium,  the whole Solana Ecosystem gets access to more liquidity. The average  all-time high ROI for the IDO is at 5,000%, while RAY which is the  native token has had a great performance in recent months.
* ORCA  
ORCA  is a DEX where the TVL has exploded recently, reaching $1.11 billion.  It is a pure AMM DEX on Solana, which encourages users to:  

* **Swap**  – Orca users can use its own pool and unlike Raydium and does not use  Serum as a source of liquidity and they can tap on liquidity pools as  well. Similar to AMM, LPs (Liquidity Providers) can provide liquidity to  Orca’s pools, which can receive parts of trading fees as  payments/interest.
* **Yield Farming Programmes** –  Aquafarms is one of these programmes, which offer users a number of  liquidity pools, which can become Acqua farms-Yield farms. ORCA enables  users to earn trading fees from participating in these farms and ORCA  tokens. Orca has an auto swap as well.",36,2021-11-02 18:54:19,129

SOL,cryptocurrency,"I've been using defi for a year now. Here's my take on the Good, Bad, and Ugly of Defi","# The Good

No more <1% interest rates, no more management fees, no more discrimination, no more paperwork, and no more long lines. And you can actually beat inflation with passive income and living off of interest. Bonus points because you can do so while being invested in crypto.

With Defi you can *Be Your Own Bank* and do most things that a financial institution would do without getting discriminated and without paying someone to give you access. In addition, because defi is open-sourced and collaborative, it works like Legos—dapps building on top of one another. This makes defi hyper-efficient unlike traditional finance, which is inherently closed in nature. 

# The Bad 

Banks exist for a reason. It's not easy to 'Be Your Own Bank'. It's not easy to set up all these accounts and manage multiple assets across a number of platforms. And—when I first used it—Defi wasn't very user-friendly at all. Here's what I had to do:

1.	Buy a stablecoin from a centralized exchange
2.	Trade the stablecoin for the gas token (ETH for Ethereum, MATIC for Polygon, etc.)
3.	Install a Web3 wallet (then for Metamask, you had to manually add the network details)
4.	Secure the private key
5.	Send token to Web3 wallet (did a test transaction first, as always!)
6.	Connect Web3 wallet to the dapps I was using
7.	Approve the tokens in the dapp
8.	Swap, deposit, and finally do defi things

It took me 2 hours to set up a Web3 wallet for the first time (takes me 5 mins now). On the early days, you didn't have on-ramps yet for networks like Polygon so the initial onboarding was expensive. I avoided most of the fees by going to BSC first and then bridging to Polygon, which involves extra steps like *buying BNB > sending it to wallet > setting up a bridge dapp > sending BNB from BSC to Polygon > approving the unwrapped BNB > unwrapping the BNB > swapping coins/tokens*

Another difficulty of being your own bank is that you're solely responsible for managing your assets now. So when crypto crashed in May, I had to manage my positions. I remember being quite frantic, moving all of my assets—spread around multiple dapps—and also rushing to funnel money in to manage my positions. 

Of course, I was never in any REAL danger, *per se.* I think I was ~20% away from paying liquidation fees at that time; but that was pretty much the floor amount of risk that I wanted to be in. Still, if I wasn't actively managing my positions, I would've been punished when the market continued to crash. If I wasn't online--for example, if I was out on vacation--then, quite frankly, I'd be royally f*cked.

# The Ugly

A study recently came out that ~50% Liquidity pool (LP) providers using Uniswap were at a net loss while participating in a LP compared to if they just held their assets. This is because of impermanent loss. I reckon, this would also translate to most of Defi at its current state.

Impermanent loss is a major issue in Defi and also one that newcomers will typically be encounter. And it’s hard to spot also because you aren’t always losing money. Sometimes, you would’ve just been better off putting your money elsewhere.

I realized this when I was using the SOL-RAY pool while on the Solana ecosystem. This was around July to October when Solana had its run up. LPs are actually great if the market isn’t pumping. I wish I knew this earlier because when Solana did pump, despite earning 70% APY on the LP fees, I was actually down $200 had I just held SOL, which did a 8x while RAY only did a 4x.

And the current state of Defi is undeniably unsustainable. The way most of it works is that protocols incentivize users with high rates but high rates are only possible with high inflation. High rates will cause high demand, because everyone wants a piece of the pie, and high demands inflates the price. At first, this makes it seem like a good opportunity (because price is rising while rates are high) but eventually, rates will decrease because there’s more users to distribute awards to. And when that happens, users leave. 

The people who benefit from these trends are the people who made it in early, while people left holding the bag get rekt. While I don’t see anything inherently wrong with this—I mean, technically early birds should get the most rewards since they’re the ones who took most of the risks—protocols and users who are late to the party are at the mercy of these nomadic farmers who come and go. Most protocols end up being in no-man’s land after a few months and users always have to be on the move.

Sticking to the theme of Defi user being farmers, Defi is currently at an era of nomadic pastoralism and needs to adopt sustainable agriculture practices. 


# Silver Lining

Defi is young and rapidly changing. Developers and users are aware of the problems and innovation is always seeking to find solutions. 

There’s a movement in the space referred to as Defi 2.0, which revamps the current model in a way that still makes Defi fair and decentralized, while also making protocols less reliant on users who come and go. 

It’s also getting easier to use and a bunch of protocols are being created to broaden the spectrum for those who prefer to have more security (of course, at the expense of trade offs in rewards). 

When in doubt, zoom out. And looking at the world of Defi as we know it today, It’s really only just been 2-3 years. Since then, the Defi ecosystem has grown to an estimated $250B + in total value locked. Imagine what it can accomplish in the next few years.",2249,2021-11-20 07:51:30,838

The reason I am comparing it to SOL is because SOL was predicted to die on a daily basis here in r/cc. Yet, it defied all the expectations and not only stayed afloat but is very close to top 10.


I'm not saying that it won't crash, in fact I guess it will as that tends to be the trend for any coin that rallies, but will it continue to rise longer term?

It's an interesting project, with very good performance metrics that should do well, but as usual with the new projects, there is controversy. I personally wouldn't buy it but I will be watching it closely just out of curiosity if it's going to stick it up to r/cc just to spite us.

Quite interesting to see some lesser known coins back then have now well on the nice moves, but at the same time many coins have fallen into oblivion.

**1. Changes in relative rankings**

A whooping 120 coins have now out of top 200. The trend is quite clear: almost all of the coins ranked on the second half (101st - 200th) are now out of top 200. Nevertheless, 41 out of 50 coins on top 50 back then are still on top 200 now.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n2t27137jgz71.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=3586f78b65df1f3a1a004da9c624c64437607f01

&#x200B;

Please do note that drop in ranking doesn't mean the market cap is going down. In some cases the market cap still go up. However, market cap goes up doesn't guarantee increase in coin price because of changes in circulating supply.

Mildly interesting: the coin that ranked 200th back then is BUSD, is now ranked 19th. No change in value because it is a stablecoin but the market cap has increased by almost 800 times from $17M to $13.53B.

&#x200B;

**2. Top 20 now - the traditional and the new comers**

A number of coins on top 20 now were not even launched in Jan-2020. They are: SOL, DOT, SHIB, AVAX, UNI. WBTC was newly launched back then with a very low market cap.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/drecswhajgz71.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=0548587a7db6e5b7d15426d11fcfaecd964f1f00

* USDC, DOGE, LUNA, ALGO and BUSD were coming from outside of top 20 back then.
* In terms of ROI, it is actually LUNA that increased over 20,000%, followed by DOGE with 10,674%.
* Later during the year, SOL came into the market with only $0.78 per coin in April 2020. It has since then increased by 29,803%.

&#x200B;

**3. Top 20 back then - where are they now?**

Only 1 coin of top 20 back then is now gone (999). Most are doing well from investment perspective.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t6v2a9eejgz71.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=15d4ca01613b03bc52f42d8ff6468b1aeb8e4f57

Quite interesting to see diversification doesn't always work with crypto. The top 2 average returns is almost double that of the top 100 or top 200 portfolio.

&#x200B;

**4. Big gainers - the ones that gained over 10,000%**

Fancy some rags to riches stories? Here are the ones that rose over 10,000%. FANTOM and LUNA top the charts here.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4w49cqxijgz71.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=79efadfa5e0928ce4bcb14c5f75210c7ec581e84

Please note these are only from Jan-2020. There are coins that gained big but weren't launched in Jan-2020 such as Solana or Shib.

**5. The ones that go to zero or near zero**

And now we talk about the other side of gambling. Various coins have lost over 90%. And if it lost 90%, which is $100 to $1, it will need to increase 9,900% just to get back to break even.

&#x200B;

[Some of these coins sound very obscure as well. They are now forgotten.](https://preview.redd.it/s4sgr8xmjgz71.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7542663202a610cc9b35e720d6bfa42fa8a79f2)

&#x200B;

**6. Summary of gains or losses**

As noted above, the returns for top 200 coins if you spread investment equally would be around 1,200%. There were big gainers but also a lot of big losers.

**Caveats:**

* I source data from Coinmarketcap and price movement from yesterday may change a bit, but I don't think it will shift any rankings significantly.
* Care had been taken but I can't guarantee 100% accuracy.
* Let me know if you want something to be added or changed.
* No staking rewards or other passive income or transaction fees are taken into account. These vary a lot and hard to quantify accurately.",2958,2021-11-13 22:40:12,444

SOL,cryptocurrency,"Those of us who have fallen victim to Celsius, FTX, LUNA, & SOL how are you doing??","Hey folks, just wanted to come on here and see how we're all doing? I personally fell victim to Celsius Network and the lies that Alex Machinsky spouted weekly assuring everyone that they would get their crypto back even if the ship sank. How stupid was I to believe him. A good chunk of my crypto is locked up there. While I did lose a lot, I also made a little bit back with Reddit Collectibles (WEN Gen 3).   


I just wanted to come on here and ask the community how we're all doing? How are you coping?? Does it ever get better?? I know it's just ""money"" but when you're surrounded by people who want crypto to fail I could never ever imagine sharing with them that I am not part of a bankruptcy proceeding in the State of NY because the company I held my crypto with was being a total degen. It's funny to think that I bought a Ledger only a few days before Celsius stopped withdrawals. I guess from all of this paint I learn't ""not your keys not your coins"".  


tldr: How are you coping if you've been affected by the failure of crypto platforms (Celsius, FTX) or crypto projects (LUNA, SOL for shits and giggles).",12,2023-03-21 05:29:16,62

**FTX is one of SOL’s largest holders, holding up to 10.0% of SOL’s total supply.**

A large portion of FTX’s SOL holdings are subject to a structured vesting schedule.

The majority of these holdings consist of vested tokens, which basically means they cannot be immediately traded on the market, but will be tradable over time. Let's dig into some figures for awareness.

Every month there's a unlock of **618,400 SOL** this represents approximately **\~$80 million** with SOL valued at $131. (1.1% of the total holdings)

\~**1st March 2025**. This is a very important date, things change here, there is a substantial unlock of **7.5 million SOL this represents approximately \~$1 billion.** (\~**13.5% of FTX’s total SOL holdings**)

Interesting fact, **7.5 million SOL** unlocked in March 2025 is actually **a massive 1.61% of the total current circulating supply** of Solana.

Another interesting fact, **7.5 million SOL unlocked in March 2025 is approximately 4x times the 24-hour trading volume of SOL/USDT on Binance & this includes Buys & Sells!** [(1.85M SOL)](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT?ref=37754157&type=spot)

When it started pumping, I thought it is a regular pump and dump. But then it crossed its ATH and is now at 100 bucks without taking a breather in between to give any chance for newcomers. I know I should not buy it when it is at its ATH. But man those gains are making me lose my shit. The only thing that is stopping me is the speculation that it might crash just like the whole market did in May after reaching the ATH.

But there's one big problem with each of these altcoins: you can't fully trust them anymore. Stuff like the recent crypto dot com ordeal, SOL, and the constant rugpulls. It's becoming more clear that you can't trust a project. There is always the thought in the back of my mind now that the developers could one day pull a CDC and just fuck over their investors. Neglect the attention ot to cover all their bases. Or just say fuck it and dip out.

The only project I seem to fully trust is Bitcoin now. I'm not worried about the developers deciding, ""oh, we're actually going to make the max supply 100m now instead of 21m."" Everything is set. It's all Gucci. 

Will I only invest in BTC now? Heck nah. I'll still keep my eyes peeled and sink some beer money into alts. But now I will be extra, extra careful. Chasing gains is over. I'm only interested in things I can trust for now on. CDC taught me a lesson. So thanks for that, I guess.

SOL,cryptocurrency,Solana Sucks: Factually-Based Reasons,"By the numbers, Solana is one of crypto's worst projects.

SOL supply inflated 68% in three years.

# SOL SUPPLY

Jan 2021:  261.9 Million

Feb 2024:  441.8 Million

180 Million New Sol spanning a 37-month timeframe.

https://preview.redd.it/i9gq0y7xprjc1.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3a13c1e6e433d1ce5cb33609ee46147a77bd99b

Solana's posted inflation schedule is adrift from reality. The asterisk symbol is its only truthful piece of information. So let's follow it and see where it leads.

[These figures are misleading](https://preview.redd.it/b0c8kozaqrjc1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ef25f0224d7e0ac35e1fc3169cbb11fabc992d9)

# EPOCH YEAR

From Solana Official Docs:  Solana's annual inflation is currently 5.515%. Note that this is an 'epoch-year', or \~ 180 epochs.

Okay now WTF is an epoch-year? An easier explanation than this.

https://preview.redd.it/5asgukmlqrjc1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=781febdca51ad3caeb5972dd872e62af902f7129

**MEANWHILE ON PLANET SOL**

On Planet Sol, a year spans 180 epochs.  1 epoch = 2.5+ days.  Epoch years range 450 to 630 Earth days.  See for yourself.

[Actual inflation rate will vary](https://preview.redd.it/2t6vibotqrjc1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b0e74de593a8154ad09a9f8500484a683d4a702)

But hold on.  ""Non-stakers pay stakers?"" What's that about? Merits a closer look.

# NON-STAKERS PAY STAKERS

New SOL issue pays Validators. Solana rewards remaining new issue to Stakers.

Problem: New SOL inflates currency and fee burn's insufficient.

Solution: Reward shields Stakers from inflation. Non-Stakers get no reward.  Non-Stakers pay for inflation. They become the yield for Solana stakers.

Non-Stakers Pay Stakers.

# DYNAMIC TOTAL SUPPLY

For those who asked, No, Solana DOES NOT have a fixed supply. Its MAX supply is like a moving island that flows upstream.

By 2032, Solana expects to circulate around 775 Million SOL

Solana's definitely a performer. Smart investors can earn so long as they're mindful of its tokenomics issues.

Over the last 12-months, 1000% ROI.🔥

# SOL to $1000;CAP to $441 Billion

* $45 Billion market cap must climb to $441 Billion to reach $1000 p/c
* To achieve that, it must capture greater share of DeFi & NFT market
* To have a chance at those markets, Solana can't tip over. Like never again.
* Solana must raise its fees

Solana's current fee structure guarantees it can never compete with Ethereum.

[Solana isn't collecting enough in fees ](https://preview.redd.it/tv9gev31ezjc1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d4a08ef6a04712beb7a28d5b9ba7aefa4e38799)

# CLOSED-SOURCE CENTRALIZATION

Etherscan is an open book for crypto projects. Right down to the source-code.

Go on Solscan and good look finding any open-source code.

High node count and active devs are canceled out by Solana's closed-source smart contracts for:

* DeFi
* NFTs

One person can change the code at any time without notice. This is the same as CeFi or proprietary apps; not crypto or open-source.

Basically I want to prank a friend by creating a coin and airdrop it them so they think they have $1 million in their hot wallet.

My plan is to make a pair on an AMM where I'm the only one that is buying it. I make small (very small) incremental buys until the coin is worth $1million.

I send them all the coins and and have him check solscan. He will think he won the lottery.

Some issues I foresee is that they may just check their wallet app and without an oracle, it won't show their balance. Naturally they may try to sell on any AMM, so I can't creat the pair on uniswap, JUP, or raydium",0,2024-06-15 03:18:47,11
SOL,cryptocurrency,Solana Labs CEO: It ‘doesn’t really matter’ if the network goes down again / let that sink in what kind of garbage Solana is,"Quick Take

* In September, the Solana blockchain was swamped by transactions and ended up going offline for 17 hours.
* Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko says that this is only a problem for those measuring in milliseconds.

When asked what are the chances the network goes down again, Yakovenko  replied, “I don’t know. It doesn’t really matter, though.”

His argument went as follows: as long as there’s at least one copy of  the ledger, the funds are still safe and the transactions will  eventually get processed. If you don’t care how long a transaction takes  to go through, “then how much do you care that there's a 72 hour  block?” 

Yakovenko likened the downtime to a particularly long wait between  blocks. He claimed that Solana didn’t really go offline, there just  wasn’t a confirmed block for that time period. “So that technically does  look like a 17-hour block if you look at the history.”

Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano have entered the chat for a laugh... C'mon bois, this is the biggest centralized shitshow of the century and it seems that going offline might happen again or frequently!

This is a really excellent write-up, produced to be used as a handy comeback whenever the classic attacks are made on solana. I already know this post is going to be attacked like crazy, but even if a couple of people read it and give sol a chance then my work is done. 

The main things you always hear on this site when you mention sol go something like this

""yeah it's great when it works"" (it is up 99.6% of the time historically, and being ""down"" is far easier for sol when it's producing blocks in under 1s, compared to 10s for eth and 10 minutes for btc)

""It's so centralised ha ha"" (it's more censor resistant than POS eth)

""SBF!"" (well check out BSC and how dependent on CZ that chain is, sol is way way better by any measure of decentralisation, and FTX involvement was much scaled back at the time of the implosion as they started to pour money into other chains like Polygon)

Personally, I've used sol for nearly two years now having spent time in eth and I would never go back. It's pain doing things like reddit NFTs on polygon by comparison. Whenever I try to defend it on here it's like admitting to having committed murder. But I'll always keep on trying!

I dont even know these like uniswap router addresses and ABI file's I tried to feed it stuff I found on internet and I think just got it wrong, I feed it stuff and it doesnt work, I ask chatgpt he says this is the problem I fix it and theres another problem.. everything I do in that aspect is wrong everything fails... I dont have time for this and Im starting to panic as its starting to take too long, this is not my field, I dont need limit orders just basic buy at market price easy stuff, I'm shocked I didn't get a functional link result on my first google search for this, I just suck at finding this really bad, I need help

I followed steps from chatgpt and gemini to solve my issues but its just a mess, keep getting various error messages I dont understand, the part of the bot that does the logic behind I cannot share for obvious reasons, the part to actually make the buy order with the contract address, is where Im struggling, I think I dont even need to bother putting it here as its probably totally wrong and its probably somewhere out there already but I just... cant find it, its probably right under my nose, I just have no idea on how to make buy order, the dumbest thing, I use python for my script so if it could be in python I could integrate it that would be great, otherwise I need a way to feed it the contract address somehow, for a second I thought uniswap-python library would save me as its super intuitive and easy but it doesnt seem to work for the base chain unfortunately, and I will also have to figure out solana after that",0,2024-04-18 19:37:10,15

SOL,cryptocurrency,I honestly don't understand why SOLANA is still in the top 5 cryptos.,"This is my first post here, but I actually meant to make this post earlier when SOL went down for 17 hours in September.

 I was very enthusiastic about solana and I was on the verge of buying a bag of SOL several times. 

The first time the system went down, I still thought to myself that this was going to be a one-time error. I did lose a lot of faith in the blockchain, but I found the concept of ""proof of history"" very interesting, so I was still interested in the coin. 
This was followed by the large price increase and the necessary hype, which caused the price to rise even more. SOL was quickly in the top 5 cryptos and took over ADA's spot easily. 

Suddenly, in September the system goes down again for several hours. I thought this would be the end of SOL. This was when I was extremely surprised that SOL's price remained stable and even continued to climb quietly. I didn't understand. 

But when the ddos ​​happened and the system was down again recently, I really really thought that SOL was going to plummet (especially in these difficult times full of uncertainty). This STILL didn't happen.

I honestly wonder how it is that SOL is still in the top 5 cryptos.",1271,2021-12-10 15:52:20,1327

 ***Find the full blog post with all the tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-49)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the 53rd monthly report for the 2018 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, NEM, DASH, IOTA,** and **Stellar.**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for four and a half years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month (snapshot below taken 1 June)
* **May Highlights:** Terra/Lunapocalypse tanks crypto
* **Overall since Jan. 2018:** **ETH** still in the lead, followed by **BTC** the only two in the green.
* **2018+2019+2020+2021+2022 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 124%  vs. S&P500's +28% if invested in the same way.**

## Month Fifty-Three – Down -32%

https://preview.redd.it/qru4ifufj1991.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=4733a4b881140fe493e0729e8570376b5feb3821

The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, IOTA, NEM, Dash,** and **Stellar**.  

May highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **Second all red month in a row**. **Bitcoin** and **Stellar** (both -23%%) fell the least.
* **ETH** maintains the overall lead, with **BTC** in second place.  Only these two cryptos are in the green since January 2018.
* The 2018 Portfolio drops to -32%, a level not seen since [January 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-37/). 

## May Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks since January 2018:

https://preview.redd.it/lqe9bqboj1991.png?width=373&format=png&auto=webp&s=7aba020a7d78e3f6bdde64fb800ebf5e8d750b4c

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:** Fifty-three months into the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have remained.  **NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA**, and **Litecoin** have been replaced by **Tether, BNB, SOL, USDC, BUSD,** and **DOGE.**  

Although some of these older cryptos have held their positions fairly well despite the recent downturn, **NEM** still looks like it might be the first of the 2018 Top Ten to drop out of the Top 100. 

Until this month, **NEM** was the lowest ranked crypto of any of the five Experiments, but, thanks to the May Terra meltdown, that honor now belongs to **LUNA** (see the latest [2022 Top Ten Update](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5) for all the gruesome details).

## May Winners and Losers

***May Winners*** –  100% red month, but **Bitcoin** and **XLM** dropped the least, ending May down -23%.

***May Losers*** –  **NEM**, dropping -43% this month.

## Overall Update –   ETH in first place, but second place BTC gains ground. NEM in last place, Portfolio back to Jan. 2021 levels

After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in [October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46), the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio has continued to lose value.  Currently, it is down -32%, levels not seen since [January 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-37/). 

After nearly four and a half years of holding these cryptos, only 2 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green: **BTC** and **ETH.**

Overall, first place **ETH** (+153%) is ahead of second place **BTC** (+127%), but the gap has been closing in recent months.

The initial $100 invested in first place **ETH** four and a half years ago?  It’s worth $253 today.

**NEM** is at the bottom, down nearly -95% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.**  The initial $100 invested in **NEM** fifty-three months ago is worth about $5 today.  

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/rfgwehsrj1991.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4e56af5ee499087bd0a2b6be1823312a250e144

End of May 2022 market cap: **$1,237,646,071,341**

Crypto as a sector is up +115% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (-32%).  You also would have more than doubled the return of the S&P (+53%) over the same period of time, and eight of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for **Ethereum and Bitcoin)**.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.65T in** [**October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/)**.**

## Bitcoin dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/n4ad5e5tj1991.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=23a87fb921c82b45b83fcc101eb72f9aac759022

**BitDom** ticked up in May ending the month at 46.1%.  When considering the entire four and a half year 2018 Experiment time frame, **BTC** dominance is near the low end.  For context:   

Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**33% in January 2018**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one).

High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: 

https://preview.redd.it/rlv3cl3yj1991.png?width=304&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2ed444531e9854432fcf322cd08545f3dfffd5

If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, **the $1000 initial investment would be worth $683**, -32% from [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

After a streak of more than a year in (or very near) positive territory, the 2018 portfolio is back on familiar red ground.  For context, in fifty-three months since the start of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, forty months have been in the red, with only thirteen months of green, all which occurred in 2021/22. 

Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment nearly 4.5 years ago:

https://preview.redd.it/5m1hxz6zj1991.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3c1d4c4962e8dba2aca088a9f5b5cea919a3215

The all time high for this portfolio is [October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46) (+72%).  The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down [\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).   

A reminder: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.  The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.

But I didn’t stop the Experiment in 2018:  I invested another $1000 into each of the ***2019***, ***2020, 2021,*** ***and 2022*** Top Tens as well.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?    

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-53) down -32% (total value $683)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +238% (total value $3,376)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +381% (total value $4,808) (*best performing portfolio)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +99% (total value $$1,991)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5) down -66% (total value $342)

So overall? Taking the five portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $5,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$11,200.** 

**That’s up +124%** on the combined portfolios, **down from** [**November’s all time high of +553%**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47) for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/dxxdx1b1k1991.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bb8db2871c082939d4fed44705b5fad64be6bd1

***That’s a +124% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for five years in a row.***

## Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  

https://preview.redd.it/yiwc1oo2k1991.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=43f446c7e881f2d3cb645ddd8ee8145827101593

The S&P 500 is up +53% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) would be worth $1,530 had it been redirected to the S&P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,530 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,640 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,270 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,090 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $860 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After five $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 my portfolio would be worth $6,390.**

That is up **+28%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+124%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

Here’s a fancy new chart showing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments: 

https://preview.redd.it/xyioqv44k1991.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=c99fca36351ed74b96556c554f12f489b367cdd4

## Conclusion:

Many thanks to the long-time Experiment followers, appreciate you taking the time to follow along over the years.  For those just getting into crypto, welcome! I hope these reports can somehow give you a taste of what you may be in for as you begin your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and try to enjoy the ride!

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect only two reports per month.  May’s extended report is on the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio (the OG Experiment), which you’re reading now. You can check out the latest  [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-38), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-27), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16), and [2022 T](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5)[o](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5)[p Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5) reports as well.

A bit late this month (went on vacation!) but wanted to share the OG 2018 Top Ten Report for May (snapshot taken 1 June).

The biggest tl;dr from my point of view:  after 15 straight months of being at or over break even, the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio is back in the red, back to where it spent the first 37 months of the Experiment (Control + F for ""Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month"" to see the table).

SOL,cryptocurrency,$729.86M of crypto assets were liquidated in the previous 24 hours! In which $608.04M were shorts and $121.82M were longs.,"Hi everyone,

In the past few days we saw a lot of price movements in the crypto market. Bitcoin went from $16k to $21k. This means that a lot of assets were liquidated, most of them were shorts. In this post I summed up some interesting liquidation statistics.

The stats in the past 24h **at the time of writing**:

\- In the past 24 hours, **$729.86M** of assets were liquidated.  
\- Liquidated longs and shorts: **$121.82M** were **longs (16.69%)** and **$608.04M** were **shorts (83.31%)**.  
\- **134.641** traders were liquidated.  
\- Top 3 Liquidations: **$261.41M** of ETH, **$240.48M** of BTC and **$26.38M** of SOL.  
\- The largest single liquidation order happened on **Huobi - BTC-USDT value $6.84M.**

It's good to see some green after a long time, but remember that a lot of people (bears) lost a lot of money during these days. Be safe over there and only invest in what you can afford to lose!

Thanks for reading!

Interesting 🤔 that Solana is running like the wind after it's massive decline the last year. 

It took a steep dive after the Fall of FTX, in part because of sellers dumping the “Sam coin” alleged fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried once loudly boosted.
to under $9 as of late just touching $8.

At the time of this post it's trading at 11.79, 18% higher than just Yesterday. 

Did Solana over correct during the FTX news 🗞️? 

Do you see potential still?

Or is this just a dead cat 🐈  bounce?  and does Sol have 9 lives?! 

Additionally Buterin made comments about Sol which has been discussed on Reddit this week. 

The news follows a show of support from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who tweeted last week that “smart people” have told him there is an “earnest smart developer community in Solana,” and that the chain has “a bright future” now that “the awful opportunistic money people have been washed out.” Buterin added that he hopes the Solana community “gets its fair chance to thrive.”.

SOL,cryptocurrency,The Algorand shillers have been relentless about the future of the project lately. I do not believe it has a future. This is the opposite of an Algorand shill post.,"The Algorand shillers have been relentless about the future of the project lately. I do not believe it has a future. This is the opposite of an Algorand shill post.

I do not hold ALGO. This is why. TLDR - just read the bold headlines.

&#x200B;

**Inflation - 27% increase**

The Inflation of a coin is simply the rate at which it is currently increasing its supply every year. I.e. If a token has a 2% inflation rate, then one year from now, 2% more tokens are available to buy.

One year ago, Algorand had [5,460,295,593](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20210919/) coins in circulation. Today it has 6,927,212,643. This represents an **increase of 27%**. Factoring in the estimated staking rate of \~5%, it means the token loses more than 20% of its value every year.

*(The coin has an inflation rate of 95% if I take the value from* [*54 weeks ago*](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20210905/)*, going from 3.5bn tokens to 6.9bn in the past year.)*

&#x200B;

**Daily Active Users - 97% drop**

This is simply the number of addresses on the blockchain that perform at least one transaction on a particular day.

During the bear market, all projects lose users. Algorand has lost a lot of its daily active users, dropping from over 1,773,000 to just 60600. This represents a **staggering 97% drop in active users**. In the same time frame, Ethereum has dropped 14% (and that doesn't even include layer 2 protocols like Arbitrum).

This statistic is so bad, it is not even available on the [explorer](https://algoexplorer.io/top-statistics) \- they only list the total accounts. I had to get the real data from Messari.

[Messari - Algorand Daily Active Addresses](https://preview.redd.it/v8y85qsid0p91.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcb5222d6567f6a5679bd69a4e3bc0f63d54c61b)

&#x200B;

**MarketCap Rank - dropped 11 spots**

This metric is market value size of the cryptocurrency relative to all other cryptocurrencies. One year ago, Algorand was ranked as the [18th largest crypto](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20210919/). Today it is 29th - a drop of 11 spots.

&#x200B;

**The CEO quit - he got bored**

Obvious. But the [CEO left the project](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/27/algorand-ceo-steven-kokinos-departs-interim-replacement-named/) to pursue other interests. Historically, any time a CEO leaves a project, it has rarely, if ever, held its value. See Loopring or Fantom...

&#x200B;

**Decentralisation - not too bad**

The level of decentralisation for Algorand is unneccesarily convoluted. The easiest way to consider its level of decentralisation is two factors:

* The [Nakamoto Coefficient](https://nakaflow.io/) is estimated to be between 13 and 15, which puts it well behind its competitors.  Avalanche 30, Solana at 31, Polkadot 82
* The number of active validators is [370](https://metrics.algorand.org/#/decentralization/). Cardano at 3500, Ethereum 411,000

&#x200B;

**Scalability - copied another project's idea**

Algorand 'solved' the scaling problem by copying what Bitcoin cash did - and somehow made it worse. They simply make bigger blocks, but [they sacrificed efficiency](https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/silvio-micali-lex-fridman-algorand-and-the-blockchain-trilemma). Bitcoin Cash creates 32MB blocks every 10 minutes - Algorand requires \~ 800 MB to accomplish the same task. Basically, it requires 25x more data to process transactions than a five year old crypto.

&#x200B;

**Finally, the shill posts...**

Some users may be aware, but it is long believe that some projects employ paid shillers. Literally people that post information in a positive light consistently. It is my belief that Algorand is guilty of this. Please understand, that this is purely speculation and I have no evidence. I would be happy to point out specific users and link posts that I am adamant are paid advertising by Algorand. But out of respect to the subs rules, I will abstain - but if a Mod approves it, I have it ready to go.

EDIT: 

Lots of people accusing me of not having the balls to respond to the comments. 

I actually responded to several of them, but most of my comments got downvoted into oblivion, so I just gave up. If you want to debate, that’s cool, but apparently you only get toddler tantrums from ALGO shillers.

I tried responding to [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xj7yhh/the_algorand_shillers_have_been_relentless_about/ip6xrdv/) comment, but my response got destroyed by the paid shillers, so I’ll put it here..

* If you want to take the snapshot of the market cap position on the date in your comment, go ahead, but then you also have to take the token supply on that date too, so enjoy the 95% inflation rate that goes with it. *

SOL,cryptocurrency,I have a tax liability question regarding the short term buying/selling of SOL and how I am going to be affected in the short term with regards to my tax liability.,"As the title states, I don't have a thorough understanding of the tax implications specifically the shortterm buying and selling of SOL and how it is going to affect me when I file my taxes. What I need is someone to explain to me in detail, what is to stop me from buying SOL at a market price of let's say $120, waiting for it to appreciate to let's say $140, selling at $140, and then rinse and repeating that process (assuming the SOL behaves that way) all within a year time frame. Can some explain to me what is going to happen to happen at the end of the taxable year in tax terms if I keep doing that? 

Bonus points!!!! If someone would also like to explain to me what happens if I hold SOL for longer for a year and then sell AND what are you guys using (software) in terms of tracking your buy and sell price and what you can accurately predict your tax liability is going to be for that given year. 

Appreciate any all help!

SOL,cryptocurrency,CARDANO's strategy TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD BY 2025 has been right in front of your very eyes: an overview of what's to come in 2022 + why Africa is the key!,"I'll start with what's to come for 2022 and then move to Africa. A series of fortunate events leading to vision 2025. All info is widely available and verifiable. Sources and links given below.

Ecosystem growth in 2022:

1. [10+ DEXes](https://twitter.com/cardano_whale/status/1465907181086130179)**, built from ground up**, that will specifically use the advantage of the extended UTxO model. Note the emphasizes on ""built from ground up"" meaning that [they will be different from what you're used from the Dapps on the account-based model blockchains.](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/16/architecting-dapps-on-the-eutxo-ledger/)  Benchmarking shows that with the eUTXO model, [around 25 to 30 orders can be easily handled within one single transaction.](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1475523126343741448)
2. **Borrow and lending protocols + robust DeFI ecosystem dropping in Q1/Q2 '22** after auditing and testing on testnet. Remember that it took Ethereum 2.5 years to have cryptokitties and Solana over more than a year to have some decent DApps. Cardano entered the smart contract era on 9 September 2021 so Q1/Q2 is pretty damn fast and it's gonna give a shockwave to the entire ecosystem not to mention **biggest ADA supply crunch once DExes are running at full speed**. As the DeFi ecosystem starts to take off, an alliance was announced to help speed it on its way through  standardisation and best practice -> [Cardano DeFi Alliance](https://cardanodefialliance.org/).
3. [DJED](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/18/djed-implementing-algorithmic-stablecoins-for-proven-price-stability/):  **a crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin contract that acts as an autonomous bank**. I can't stress the importance of this enough. **Djed is the** ***first*** **coin to use formal verification to eliminate price volatility.**  The first implementation of a Djed stablecoin contract was [SigmaUSD](https://sigmausd.io/#/) on Ergo.
4. [**Hydra**](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/17/hydra-cardano-s-solution-for-ultimate-scalability/) **is Cardano's solution to ultimate layer 2 scalability** that aims to maximize throughput, minimize latency,  incurring low to no costs, and greatly reducing storage requirements.  Hydra introduces the concept of [isomorphic state channels](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/299.pdf):  that is, to reuse **the same ledger representation to yield uniform,  off-chain ledger siblings, which we call Heads** (hence the Hydra name,  which references the [mythological, multi-headed creature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra)).  Specifically for Cardano, this means that native assets, non-fungible  tokens (NFTs), and Plutus scripting are available inside *each* Hydra Head.  **Many  of the transactions currently handled by the main-chain or application  running on the main chain can benefit directly from Hydra, because it  understands just the same transaction formats and signatures.**  In a layer 2 system like Hydra, it is possible to achieve **confirmation times of** ***less than one second***. Throughput measured in TPS per Hydra head is mostly limited by the available hardware. In principle, **by adding increasing  numbers of Hydra heads to the system, arbitrarily high throughput can be  achieved by the system as a whole**. ( e.g. each stake pool on Cardano could achieve about 1000 TPS there are over 3000+ stake pools on Cardano right now so when implemented you could in theory achieve 3M+ TPS = 1000 TPS/stake pool \* 3000+ stake pools)
5. [Babel fees](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/25/babel-fees/) =  **being able to pay transaction fees in custom currencies! Potential to bring all ERC-20 tokens to Cardano** for obvious reasons ([see converter in action here](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/12/07/the-agix-erc20-converter-testnet-is-now-live/))... First, let us recall how **native assets** work in Cardano: Tokens can be created according to a minting policy and they **are treated natively in the ledger along with ada**. **Cardano's ledger adopts the  Extended UTXO (EUTXO) model**, and issuing a valid transaction requires consuming one or more UTXOs. A **UTXO  in Cardano may carry not just ada but in fact a token bundle that can  contain multiple different tokens,  both fungible and non-fungible**. In this way **it is possible to write  transactions that transfer multiple different tokens with a single  UTXO.** **Transaction fees in the ledger are denominated in ada according to a function fixed as a ledger parameter**. A powerful feature of Cardano's EUTXO model is that the **fees** required for a valid  transaction **can  be predicted precisely prior to posting it. This is a  unique feature  that is not enjoyed by other ledger arrangements (such as  the  account-based model used in Ethereum)**. Indeed, in this latter  case  the fees needed for a transaction may change during the time it  takes  for the transaction to settle, since other transactions may  affect the  ledger's state in between and influence the required cost  for processing  the transaction.""
6. [**NFTs are booming**](https://opencnft.io/marketplace) and yet you only hear about ETH/SOL NFT stuff. **106M ADA traded over 9 NFT marketplaces in just 6 months!!** I expect 2022 to be a game changer when it comes to **GamiFi, DeFi and RealFi which will lead (did I mention this already :)?) to the the biggest supply crunch of ADA** since Cardano's inception.  **This means that anyone can mint their own tokens, including  non-fungible tokens (NFTs) without needing a smart contract.**
7. The first stage of the **Voltaire** era aka **Project Catalyst:** which is the **biggest decentralized fund (any chain)** right now! It has over **700 million ADA and it's used to fund all kind of projects** including some of the DEXes, NFT marketplaces, and other lending protocols mentioned above. **That's approx. 1 billion $** in our war chest to fund the devs on Cardano and create their DApps and other products. It's been successfully active for almost a year now.
8. [**Mithril**](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/29/mithril-a-stronger-and-lighter-blockchain-for-better-efficiency/) boosts the efficiency of *full node clients* or applications.  It ensures **fast and secure synchronization of the full node data,  significantly improving time and required resources including  computation, network exchange, and local storage while keeping  high-level security guarantees.** Mithril is also applicable to *light clients and mobile applications*, ensuring a trustless approach. **Another significant advantage is using Mithril signatures for running** ***sidechains***\*\*.  The main blockchain can connect to **different sidechains that can even  have different consensus protocols**. Mithril has benefits in lightweight  blockchain state verification, and thus, certificates can validate the  current state of the specific blockchain as well as the correctness of  forward and backward transfers in a secure way. Finally,  stake-based voting applications and governance solutions can use Mithril  regardless of the voting protocol’s complexity. Mithril signatures can  be utilized for secure and lightweight tally verification. This is also  useful in governance when stakeholders go through a decentralized  decision-making process and provide the final result in an easy and  verifiable way.
9. So, **sidechains and different consensus protocols you say**? Yessir, that's called **Basho** phase on Cardano. There's another cool thing from dcSpark called [Milkomeda](https://dcspark.gitbook.io/milkomeda/):  **Milkomeda will launch in both of these ecosystems (Solana & Cardano) and deploy EVM-based sidechains for each. This will aid them in acquiring existing Solidity developers out there who are interested in building dApps for whole new user bases.** With a first mover advantage for sidechains on both chains, expect to ride the initial wave of excitement and build a protocol that makes a difference and lasts.

**Now AFRICA!**

[Try to watch this short video](https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/rekl92/africa_and_the_world_has_crypto_the_answer/) to understand why they are the key and why Cardano team has been over there for almost 5 years now.

Putting it all together: the ""mastermind's"" tweets (John 'o Connor) announcing African deals.

1. [Yearly remittance in sub-saharan Africa is a $48bn market, and 50% of that goes to a single country.... Nigeria. With stable coins (see 3) ) and hydra (see 4))  is looking to disrupt this.

5. The global buzz around Cardano: announcement of an education program with [3,500 schools and five million pupils](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/).
6. [Source](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/26/africa-is-where-the-tough-get-going/): Why Africa?

If the whole world is globalizing and changing, you want to be  where all the systems are going to change first, because if you get it  right, **more wealth will be created here over the next three decades than  in Europe, the United States and China combined.** That’s just how it is.  It’s why the US got on top in the 20th century. It just simply had a  better system than the competitors. And everything resets when you have  technological change. **We now live in a global economy. People from  Africa are going to be on equal footing with people in Europe and  America if we do things the right way. And then it’s a meritocratic  race, and I’m going to bet on the people who are tougher, more resilient  and more entrepreneurial 10 out of 10 times. They’re going to win –  it’s just that simple.** 

So IOG has a pan-African view as a company. We started in a pretty  difficult country to do business in, Ethiopia, and you know what?  **Everywhere we looked, we saw well-educated, well-intentioned people who  really did want change. And they worked with us. Sometimes the system  worked against us; sometimes it worked with us. But everybody remembered  why they were there. And it was the privilege of my career to announce a  deal of five million people that could grow to 20 million, that could  grow to a national ID system of 110 million in just a few years, and  that could grow into a voting system, a payment settlement system.** It  can grow to anything. It’s kind of like the stem cell: once you’re in,  you’re in, and you can keep navigating and growing. And then how do we  take that to Kenya, to Nigeria? That’s 400 million people – more than  the population of the entire United States – within grasp in five to 10  years.

**What’s most extraordinary is that this will transform the lives of  people. Now, boring work has to be done, dry presentations given about  credential this and verification that. And they’re very necessary. But  at the core of all of that are people.**

6) [Crypto + identity solutions for Africa = RealFi:](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/25/welcome-to-the-age-of-realfi/)  By **integrating digital identity with Cardano, we can create real value and opportunity for people across the globe.**

Among nations with developed economic systems, **DeFi has  highlighted the potential for blockchain to disrupt financial ‘legacy’  systems and open up access to new users hunting for better yields and  moving liquidity** around. It has established an entirely new financial  paradigm and the **$100bn DeFi market is expected to grow significantly  over the next few years as models continue to evolve.**

However, as  much as the age of DeFi is creating fresh markets and driving  compelling new use cases, **it has also further highlighted the economic divide between people who can easily access financial products, and  those who cannot.**

**The reason why banks refuse credit or loans in emerging markets is  often that they don’t have enough data about the person or organization  intending to borrow.**

All the **necessary financial information can be stored and relayed  in a verifiable manner through an** [**Atala PRISM ID**](https://atalaprism.io/app)**.** The monetary building  bricks of DeFi can be used to structure these loans and hedge the  currency risk, while scalable payment rails provided by Cardano and  various layer 2 solutions will make it possible to transfer capital  across the world without friction.

[Atala Prism](https://www.atalaprism.io/)  is a **decentralized identity system that enables people to own their personal data and interact with organizations seamlessly, privately, and  securely. The Atala Prism team is integrating metadata to certify and  store DIDs and DID documents on Cardano.** Also, it will be possible not  only to create but also to revoke credentials such as university  certificates.

**Atala Trace and Atala Scan are being developed to  enable brand owners to improve the visibility over supply chain  processes and establish product provenance and auditability.** In these  cases, metadata integration will be used to record tamper-proof  supply-chain records.

**Cardano adds the final piece of the financial puzzle by unlocking real economic value at the end of the transaction chain:** ***personal identity...***

**Identity  is central to everything. Once someone has an economic identity, a  world of opportunity and inclusivity opens up. Real opportunity comes  with access to essential services that were hitherto out of reach. And  real finance, such as loans to open a business or maintain an existing  one. RealFi.**

**Identity can become an asset in so far as it can be a  substitute for collateral.** A lender's overriding concern is to ensure  that loans (plus any interest accrued) are paid back. One way of  enforcing this is by collateralizing the loan, but if the lender has  enough and clear information about a borrower (if they know the borrower  is a high-earner, or a long-standing customer), the lender might be  more inclined to forgo the collateral.

SOL,cryptocurrency,ETH vs ADA vs SOL - which one has more growth from here?,"Interested to hear what people’s thoughts are. Just looking at stats:

- ETH: clearly a leader, so much runs on it. $454Billion Market Cap. Over the last 1yr has had a 911% upside.

- ADA: Love it, hate it, believer or not, it’s number 3 on CoinGecko with a market cap of $91Billion. 1yr upside: 2,903%

- SOL: Has massive backing from Sam, a blossoming ecosystem, NFTs etc. and at number 7 on CoinGecko has a market cap of $40Billion. 1yr upside: 3,868%

P.S. I’m sure there will be other coins that may or may not out perform these 3,
but that’s not the question here

Ethereum is the undisputed king of dApps and smart contracts currently. However, it is really interesting to see other coins like SOL, LUNA, DOT, AVAX, ADA, and others, strive for this as well.

In my novice eyes, SOL seems to be the frontrunner as the most prominent ETH Killer. LUNA and DOT are basically tied, with AVAX quickly catching up. ADA is trying but their lack of any real products (despite their high market cap) makes them on the lower end of this list.

Since its [launch back in March 2020](https://messari.io/asset/solana/profile), Solana has had a series of issues - from hacking to downtime to people being drained of their investments and funds completely frozen.

In 2022 alone, Solana has had not one.... not two... but ""[12 serious outages](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/solanas-sixth-network-outage-will-surely-push-sol-price-down-the-hill/)"". And yet people still buy. People still buy regardless of hacks, this last one netting [5 million usd](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/03/hackers-attack-solana-crypto-stealing-millions.html) in losses so far. That puts the total hacked from everyday investors IN THIS YEAR ALONE at over [500-million usd](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/blockchain-hackers-stole-almost-700-million-in-2022-solana-bsc-2022-3). Why the hell stand behind this crypto? There's literally thousands of cryptos to choose from. Is their NFT art seriously worth it? Seriously. Is speed that important? The chain is obviously compromised to hell and has made cryptocurrency a laughing-stock to skeptics. Their nodes are shit and obviously centralized by ""The Solana Foundation"" contributing to new nodes. Gtfo, so now the nodes have to vote along with ""the Solana Foundation"" or lose their funding. Sounds super decentralized.

It's a trash project and I just want to genuinely understand why it's still relevant when there's literally thousands of projects around and some solid ones too far outside the top 10. Maybe I'm preaching to the choir but it blows my mind.",978,2022-08-06 14:29:45,988

My question is why?

Is there a centralized issue? Some weird distribution? Are they just talking about the fact that a lot of shitcoins there can't last more than 10minutes?

SOL,cryptocurrency,Nearly 450 days after becoming a top 10 crypto Solana has been flipped by Matic and fallen out of the top 10.,"On Aug. 16th 2021, Solana flipped Uniswap (now rank 17) to become a top 10 crypto. Below is an image of the top 10 at the time the flip occurred.  

https://preview.redd.it/gznz567mxky91.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1d47e94f343a15e97c5c8eb311f1783d2642de4

Since then, Solana shot up in value, skyrocketing from $63.86 to over $250 (and becoming the number 4 crypto) just under 3 months later on Nov. 05, 2021. However the 2022 bear market has been particularly hard on SOL as it's currently down \~88% since the ATH. Outage after Outage over the last year has caused this novel Proof of History blockchain to bleed out its market cap.  

Now just 448 days after becoming a top 10 crypto SOL has officially been flipped by MATIC and fallen out of the top 10. How long the flip lasts is another question, but for now SOL is out of the top 10.

Cardano and Solana both are great projects IMHO and both have their own issues.


Cardano is known for not being, erm.., on time for certain things (read as, Smart Contracts).


Solana is known for it's decentralisation (NOT).


So this begs the question why on earth does this sub Loves cardano and fight everyone and their dog for it, but exercise caution when it comes to dealing with Solana.

SOL,cryptocurrency,What’s happening with ETH? opinions wanted ,"As we all know ETH has struggled somewhat so far this cycle, with the exception of the ETF hype earlier this year.

BTC got within 10% of its ATH this past week, while ETH is 45% or so away. SOL is doing crazy things.
Fundamentally ETH has better decentralisation, more TVL etc, but SOL has the narrative at the moment at least.

I’ve seen good arguments how ETH/BTC tends to drop until Q4 or so, and then rallies. But I’ve also seen arguments about how L2s have taken away the value prop for ETH. 

Would love some opinion on where this sub thinks ETH is going. Does it do alright if BTC soars to $100k? Has ETH lost too much narrative?

Today SOL is up another 20%...","It's of course always best to buy the bottom or DCA before the pump. But if the coin wasn't on your radar, it's difficult to do so. When SOL started pumping around 15 August, I was careful. Solana already surpassed its previous ATH. I didn't buy in because I was fearful of getting rekt due to incompetence FOMO. If I did buy then, I would already be up around 2x. And when SOL pumped a couple of days ago, I decided once again to not buy in, for the same reason. 

Today SOL is once again up 20%, I've decided not to buy Solana because the price is already so high. Is that a good decision? Probably not.

If you dig into these incidences, it seems all of them were halted after discussions on discord groups by the validators of the chain and all of them arrived at the conclusion that given the situation its better to halt the chain till the issues are ironed out. 

How can these kind of validators be expected to keep a chain up if governments of the day decide it is required to shut the chain down? They wont, they will fold immediately. The effort required by a government agency to shut these chains down will be minimal.",1403,2022-06-10 05:52:06,458
SOL,cryptocurrency,Careful buying GSOL Grayscale Solana Trust (SOL),"GSOL trust which tracks SOL is way overpriced and has low volume and has only been trading a few days.

Yesterday it's closing price was $22.10 with only 185 shares traded. [See Yahoo Chart](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GSOL?p=GSOL)



But since the Graysacle trusts GBTC and ETHE are trading at significant net asset value (NAV) I would not get in for awhile.



See the biggest warning now  is there is only 0.38587282 SOL per Share and there is a 2.5% annual fee. Per the [Grayscale Solana Trust landing page.](https://grayscale.com/products/grayscale-solana-trust/) So if GSOL was trading at full NAV it's price would be ~$8.5 , compared to the current price of $22.10



If the NAV gets in line with GBTC and ETHE I may consider getting some GSOL in a retirement account where it is difficult to custody SOL directly. So if GSOL was like $5 today I would consider purchasing it.",4,2023-04-28 11:57:13,41

It seemed to be more stable than SOL. It seemed like such a good investment. I honestly just feels like a scam, and it seems like the people behind it aren’t even trying.

SOL,cryptocurrency,How do you REALLY think the market will react to the ETF approval?,"So I've seen three different - popular - takes as to how the market will react to the ETF approval, these are;

1) Bitcoin will have the biggest move, with alt coins just tagging along for the ride.
2) It will trigger a general bull run where you get the usual random 100x shitcoin shenanigans, everyone trying to convince eachother which alt is going to moonshoot whether it be ALGO, DOT, SOL or ADA and so on.
3) The price goes down as people sell the news.

Personally I think it'll be option one. What do you guys think, also how do you think ETH will react since that's the other big player?

My follow up question is how are you preparing for this? Personally I'm change a good chunk of my portfolio for BTC in preparation, then once everything settles down, I'll redistribute into other projects.

SOL,cryptocurrency,BAT being bullish! Is it really just the partnership with SOL?,"Earlier this week the partnership between Brave and Solana was announced and BAT, the token of Brave made some very positive moves.

New ATH in ad numbers was achieved as well: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qs5p0r/very\_bullish\_numbers\_for\_bat\_ad\_campaigns\_on\_a\_ath/](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qs5p0r/very_bullish_numbers_for_bat_ad_campaigns_on_a_ath/)

At the same time, new details for the wallets were revealed and a sneak peak on the Gemini integration for Android was shared.

Me for one, can not wait for Gemini to be added to the Android version of Brave!

Articles discuss the reason for the positive price trend, following a quote of one of them:

""So, with BAT nearing ATH levels, there’s a high chance it will reach May’s levels, looking at its recent recovery in the short term. Especially since the token is backed by whales and investor volume.""

The community behind Brave and BAT are very active and are tirelessly working social media channels like Twitter and telegram.

Half of the supply or more of many newer layer 1 protocols is owned by VCs and insiders with a tiny slice for retail (that limited supply is why they pump), meaning the rich get even richer off of you. If you want a truly decentralized crypto 3.0, get others with more of that blue pie (ERGO, ADA, DOT, etc.)... When SOL starts dumping, it's gonna be spectacular.

SOL,cryptocurrency,SOL is making me question everything I thought I knew about DCAing.,"Like many others, I entered the crypto investing space very green. I was so excited to get started that I dumped cash into Doge around 55 cents and ADA around $2.10. As you can imagine, I had a very good, then an extremely bad time with those investments right out of the gate.

Thankfully I held and used it as a learning experience, after which I converted to the ""DCA in, DCA out"" strategy. I started breaking up my purchases into smaller sums during the May-July dip, and now, as things go green again, I've been shaving 25% off a few of my best performing coins every so often.

Enter SOL. I bought in around $32. When it hit $45, I took some profits. When it hit $60, I took more. Then again at 75. Again at 82. And 88. Now, I'm left with about an 8th of my original investment, and of course some nice profits, but I can't help but feel I made a mistake. When a coin like SOL goes straight up without taking any breaks, it's hard to assume that will continue.

SOL,CryptoMarkets,SOL Analysis: Why Solana might be the next big move for small-cap investors in 2024,"Been seeing a lot of discussions about entry-level crypto investments lately, and I wanted to dive deeper into why SOL (Solana) is catching attention as a promising mid-term play.

Key points worth considering:

1. Price Accessibility

* Currently trading at a fraction of ETH's price
* Allows newer investors to own whole units rather than fractions
* Lower entry barrier compared to other L1s

1. Technical Advantages

* Significantly faster transaction speeds (65,000 TPS)
* Lower gas fees compared to ETH
* Growing developer ecosystem

1. Recent Developments

* Major DeFi projects migrating to Solana
* Increased institutional interest
* Strong recovery from FTX fallout showing resilience

However, important risks to consider:

* Network stability issues (though improving)
* Competition from other L1 solutions
* Market volatility

For those looking to get exposure to SOL, consider DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) instead of going all in. You might also want to look into copy trading established portfolios that include SOL alongside other assets for better risk management.

Remember the buzz around Hamsters v1? It introduced live-streamed hamster races where we could bet on our favorite furballs using the HAMS token. It was a fun concept that brought a unique twist to crypto gaming.

SOL,CryptoMarkets,"Side-by-Side Comparison of BGSOL, BNSOL, and bbSOL Liquid Staking Tokens for Solana","Alright, if you’re into staking on Solana but still want to keep things liquid, you’ve probably come across BGSOL, BNSOL, and bbSOL. These tokens basically let you earn staking rewards while staying flexible with your assets. I did a little digging, so here’s a quick comparison to help you figure out which one might suit you best.

# Estimated APR & Earnings

* **BGSOL**: This one’s got a solid base APR of **8.15%**, but with extra incentives from Bitget, it can hit **30.15%**. Plus, if you stake the first **$1,000** via Bitget Wallet on the Solayer Restaking Network, you can earn **up to 25% APY**. Not too shabby, right?
* **BNSOL**: The APR here is **dynamic**, but Binance hasn’t shared exact numbers (thanks, Binance 🙄).
* **bbSOL**: No fees at all – **0% management fee, 0% validator commission,** and **0% withdrawal fees**. The only cost is a **0.1% SOL deposit fee**. So if you're allergic to fees, bbSOL might be the move.

# Redemption & Liquidity

* **BGSOL**: No lock-in period – you can **redeem whenever** you feel like it.
* **BNSOL**: There’s a **4-day wait** if you want to convert BNSOL back to SOL.
* **bbSOL**: It’s **tradeable** on Bybit and other exchanges. The info I found didn’t say if there’s a waiting period, so it seems pretty chill on that front.

# Where You Can Use These Tokens

* **BGSOL**: Works across a bunch of DeFi platforms like **Orca Dex, Solayer, Kamino**, and **Save Lending**. Also gets you access to Bitget’s **LaunchPool and PoolX**, plus potential **airdrops**.
* **BNSOL**: Mostly useful on **Binance** for **trading, lending**, or adding to **liquidity pools**.
* **bbSOL**: You can use it with **Orca, Kamino**, and **Solayer** – nice little DeFi ecosystem going on here.

# What Makes Each One Special

* **BGSOL**: Comes with **Active Validator Set (AVS) delegation**, making it faster and more secure.
* **BNSOL**: Super simple with a **one-click staking process** and the usual Binance-level security and support.
* **bbSOL**: It’s the **first exchange-backed LST** and runs on the **SPL stake pool program**, which has gone through a bunch of audits.

# So, Which One’s Right for You?

Honestly, it all comes down to what you’re after:

* If you want **higher APR** and more **DeFi options**, go with **BGSOL**.
* If you’re already using **Binance** a lot, **BNSOL** makes sense.
* If you hate fees and like **trading your tokens freely**, **bbSOL** is the way to go.

  
So yeah, for me BGSOL really seems to steal the spotlight, especially if you’re looking for high rewards, flexibility, and utility. What do you guys think? Let me know would love to hear your thoughts!

SOL,CryptoMarkets,Many devs are leaving Solana and bridging their projects over to Ethereum and Polygon. What could this mean for the future of Solana.,"Devs have been slowly leaving Solana for a while now. This got amplified after the FTX fiasco sent SOL down to record lows, but this alone isn’t the only reason why devs are moving out.

One of the main issues forcing devs to switch to other chains is downtime. Solana has become infamous for its frequent network shutdowns. They even had to restart the chain at one point.

This along with the coin losing value fast, is making the chain less popular with the masses and in extension, the developers.

Major Solana dApps, NFT projects, and GameFi projects are moving to Ethereum and Polygon.

The top 2 NFT projects, DeGods and Y00ts are moving to Ethereum and Polygon respectively.

Magic Eden, one of the biggest GameFi projects on Solana is also moving to Polygon, and even Solana-focused crypto wallets like Phantom are now adding Ethereum and Polygon support.

Its hard to speculate exactly how this will impact the future of Solana as a chain, but so far it doesnt look too good. Many devs are planning to move away to rivaling chains and the Solana community can only support the chain too much.

Although the ball is now rolling, Solana might still have a chance if they solve certain fundamental problems related to centralization and downtime.",50,2023-01-20 04:14:27,60

SOL,CryptoMarkets,Analyst Predicts Solana Price Could Drop Below $100,"
Recently, [Solana](https://www.nanovest.io/kripto/sol/) surged to levels above $155 within the past 24 hours, generating significant excitement. However, this situation was short-lived. According to Alan Santana, a prominent market expert, there's a possibility of a decline in Solana's price potentially dropping below the critical $100 level.

Solana Coins Analysis

Based on a post published by Santana on July 3rd, the formation of an 'ABC' pattern suggests a correction in Solana's price, a concept known for showing price movements within a certain range and typically forming a zigzag pattern.

In the initial phase A, there was an increase followed by a decline. Subsequently, phase B, the second stage, indicated a weaker recovery far from the previous peak. Finally, phase C, showing the lowest point of several periods, indicates a deep decline. Based on this chart, Santana suggests there's a possibility that Solana's price could drop below $100.

The price prediction made by the analyst aligns with current market trends indicating that Solana could see sales between $80 and $100. Santana also mentioned specific price movements for SOL could range between 40% and 50%, adding the following explanation:

""The peak of wave B for sub-ABC wave is below and Solana heads towards $80. This is the same price Solana traded at in January 2024. To be fair, let's make Solana's current range towards the price range of $80 to $100.""

Current Solana Price?

Bitcoin started the first day of this week with positive prospects, but this did not last long. There was a significant price drop from above $63,000 and is now at $62,000.

The price drop in BTC triggered a decline in Solana's price. After a 4.25% drop, SOL's price stands at $141.70. It's worth noting that Solana rose from $10 in 2023 to above $200 in March 2024, placing it at the top of the list of high-volume and best cryptocurrencies in the market. Additionally, SOL's market capitalization fell to $65 billion after experiencing a decline.

Despite the decline, 24-hour trading volume increased to $2.7 billion, up 55%, suggesting investors are selling quickly to minimize losses.

SOL,CryptoMarkets,"Solana Might Reach $1200 by 2025, Is It Possible? Here's the Explanation!","
[Solana](https://www.nanovest.io/kripto/sol/) (SOL) has shown resilience despite market corrections, with bullish forecasts indicating significant price increases. The actions to maintain horizontal support levels have led to higher lows and potential bullish formations.

Solana Shows Bullish Trend

Leading analyst Ali Martinez shares an optimistic outlook for Solana through X, noting that current altcoin movements resemble behavior seen in 2021. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) during both periods shows similar low levels before significant changes, contributing to Solana's price increase in mid-2021. Currently, the RSI is at a low level indicating a potential bullish trend.

Martinez's analysis, extrapolating from historical patterns, projects a price target of $950 for Solana. He emphasizes that technical indicators, particularly in oversold conditions, support the possibility of a bullish trend.

Raoul Pal's Forecast for 2025

Raoul Pal, a prominent figure in the crypto space, has expressed confidence in Solana's future price forecasts. He predicts significant price increases in 2025, especially during the anticipated crypto summer. Pal considers a 100% price increase conservative, expecting a rise of around 300% that would set the price around $600.

Furthermore, Pal speculates that Solana could reach $1,200 during the market cycle, with potential to exceed $2,000. For the short-term cycle, he predicts a price around $750.

Current Market Performance and Activity

Currently, SOL is priced at $142.69, reflecting a 2.53% increase over the last 24 hours, and a 3.45% decrease over the past week. The 24-hour trading volume of Solana is $3,767,161,926.

As reported by AMBCrypto, Solana's network activity significantly increased in the second quarter of 2024. Transaction fees and revenues exceeded $26 million, marking a 42-fold increase from the previous year. Total SOL sales volume reached $292 billion, nearly seven times higher than the same period in 2023.

This growth is attributed to Solana's expanding ecosystem with the introduction of the SOL ETF.

SOL,CryptoMarkets,Solana vs Near Protocol - or another blockchain? Web3.0 Development,"Hello friends. Recently, many new generation blockchains have emerged that are helping to integrate web3.0 much more intensively and faster than Ethereum can.

I am not asking you to scold in defense of a particular blockchain, I want to hear constructive comments that will help me determine whether there is any sense in such projects and how they will exist in the coming years.

As you already understood, now we will talk about the Solana blockchain and Near Protocol.

Technologically, these projects are very similar and solve the same problem - the scalability of decentralized technologies on the Internet.

The projects perform almost the same function, but the Solana ecosystem is much more developed than the Near Protocol.

but in some ways, Near is ahead of Solana's technological advancement. Offering by the user gas free DeFi by means of Aurora and low commissions with a maximum commission throughput rate of 100k tps

So this is my question. By and large, the functions of these blockchains are already performed by the BSC, what is the point of developing the same technological solutions?

Perhaps this is the same as Pepsi and Cola, in fact the same drinks, but someone loves Pepsi, and someone loves Coca-Cola.

Will the cryptocurrency market come to one solution? Or the market will continue to be replenished with new ""drinks""",24,2021-12-15 13:32:08,75

NFA but personally in a solana short right now. looks to me as if there was liquidity grab via liquidations + running stops out of market. you can see range liquidations get taken out just by running isolated leverage levels and finding where they collect.  
attached is a tv image depicting this: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/7Wjb4Z91/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/7Wjb4Z91/)

aside from TA, orderflow is looking like shorts got completely pushed out. you can tell because volume + liquidations spiked while open interest dropped. TPO shows this still a good time weighted entry- we arent at this level for long (141.30 as of writing). [https://www.tradinglite.com/x/24042yrn40](https://www.tradinglite.com/x/24042yrn40)

SOL,CryptoMarkets,The Great Memecoin Migration: Why Investors Are Flocking to Solana  ,"First of all I believe every Solana meme coin investor  was once a BSC meme coin investor. Though I agree now Solana is raking a lot of volume mostly through meme coins but we got to agree that the first target of this frenzy of BSC. 

I remember before the December of 2020, everyone’s eyes keen on BTC pump with it breaking ATH after ATH at 30k USD or more ( now it’s at 60k + USD) and also the GameStop stock and the whale manipulation; these were the hot topics of the town.

Then our lovely Tesla CEO decided why not spice things and unknowingly triggered a chain of events that lead to current popularity of the meme market. Well you know what I am talking about , Elon decided to play god , becoming the first meme crypto twitter influencer shilling DOGE and kickstarted the trend of Dog coins , then Cat coins and so on !

Ethereum had the high cap meme coins but people wanted less fee charged for transactions and moving their coins , so they found BSC and the amount of coins that flooded the chain and the amount of money that poured in , it changed the lives of many people unfortunately not me as I was a bit late to trend or made poor choices 😂

After BTC hit its top , all the money flowed out from BSC and meanwhile airdrop trend on Solana where people made five figs through their Solana airdrops kickstarted the shift from BSC to Solana. But again as BTC dumped , the meme market went dead silent for a while until it recently started pumping like hell , bringing back the Solana meme market and now it’s like the go to place for meme coins.

Why Solana ? Coz its transaction fee is low compared to other smart chains and it’s fast transactions and scalability using bots like Trojan bots to run transactions at even faster rate , set limits for buy and sell , DCA and so on for coins that aren’t even listed on an exchange which shows how far meme coins have come.

The money I lost during my time in BSC , I made back through Solana meme space but overall looking long term wise , I will transition from meme coins , it’s just a means to make quick money. But as we know all means of quick money involves risk , you should be investing only money you are willing to lose and play safe in a risky market with using 10% of your total investment. Always remember realised profits are realistic and better than unrealised profits coz one thing going up, can go down anytime with the volatility in the meme space. Be greedy , take profits all the time ! 

As funny as it sounds this meme coin trading as affected my mentally and physically , spending hours scouting coins , figuring out the best ones and anxiety of making quick profits on regular basis and the sadness at minor losses. Once I have made enough , I plan to move out from trading meme coins , with allocating only minor funds which I don’t have to monitor on regular basis.

I also wonder what makes the memecoin worthy of investing/higher marketcap. Is it the ticker or is it the team and community or is it insider play pushing the coin ? Like as the name suggests shouldn’t they be based of a meme , but most of the coins out there aren’t , so shouldn’t we classify them as something else 🤔

Some coin tickers and their name do sound funny like bonk, $wif , $dogwif , $yewif and so on and makes me wanna invest but at higher market cap it’s difficult to make money , so lower market cap coins are the go to ones like michi , maneki , ye wif hat and so on.

Will this trend die at the moment? as there is a lot of money to make for and move on to safer plays beyond meme coins.

For Solana fans, this might be a buying opportunity. The price is way down from its April high of $200, currently sitting around $130. So, what's the future looking like for Solana? Can it hit $1000? Who knows 🤷‍♂️

While Solana's been a bit quiet lately, there's another blockchain called Base Chain that's been making some serious noise. Their market cap is still way smaller than Solana's (only 1.79% dominance compared to Solana's 4.2%), but it's been growing like crazy over the past month.

Here's the interesting part: I've been hearing a lot about Base Chain's memecoins, and they seem to have tons of potential.  There's a lot of room for growth in that market, especially compared to Solana's established memecoins like WIF and the recently surging YEWIF.

Speaking of memecoins, Solana's definitely got a strong game going on.  We've got all sorts of fun ones like YEWIF, BONK, BOME, POPCAT, MEW, and of course, the OG WIF. These might be silly, but they definitely bring a lot of energy and users to the Solana platform which makes me wonder that do memecoins drive volume to a smart chain? 

Solana's a proven player, but with Base Chain on the rise, it'll be interesting to see how things shake out. Will Solana bounce back? Will Base Chain's memecoins continue to explode? Is Base the next solana and after we are done dumping memecoins on base will it also die ? This seems like a repeating cycle with people jumping from one smart chain to another !

Buckle up for a political twist in the world of crypto! On Solana, a new kind of meme coin meta has emerged, with tokens based on the names (intentionally misspelled, for added humor) of real-life politicians like the current president.  
  
This unexpected intersection of politics and blockchain has even spawned a book – a hilarious (one would hope) commentary on the current state of affairs, all fueled by the wild world of cryptocurrency.  
  
The storyline behind Buk of Politks is quite funny they say the following in their new Telegram bio, ""Originated from pump.fun, The dev was sleeping while we hit Raydium, so we took charge of him!""  
  
And their website is fire, to be honest. That is what most of their members are saying you can take a look for yourself, https://bukofpolitiks.xyz/  
  
It is also worthy and funny to mention that while the dev was asleep one member of the community paid for dexscreener social update. It went all the way to 300K market cap and now it is on a dip perfect for those meme hunter to jump in.

SOL,CryptoMarkets,The Unstoppable Rise of Solana Memecoins in 2024: A New Era for Crypto Enthusiasts?,"2024 has been a year of relentless hype in the crypto market. A Bitcoin ETF was the catalyst but optimism has spread to the deepest layers of the altcoin world. Memecoins are standing out as the asset to watch in this bull market. Solana-based memecoins have been performing exceptionally strong and are outperforming the broader market.


◇Why Solana?


Solana has been intensely competing with Ethereum to be the predominant blockchain for decentralized applications and new projects. While Ethereum still stands ahead in market cap, Solana is quickly closing that gap. It’s high throughput and low transaction fees appeal to both project developers and users. Several memecoins like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk Inu (BONK) have seen remarkable gains and exchange listings after choosing Solana as their underlying chain.


◇Why Memecoins? Why Now?


The appeal of meme coins goes beyond humour. Memecoins are the product of a distorted monetary and banking system which has been abused by those in power. Those in power belittle our money by making the money machine go brrrrrr. So the people have begun to choose coins that are based on cultural memes. The market has spoken. In 2024, as the crypto market continues to evolve, memecoins on Solana have tapped into a zeitgeist that values quick, viral popularity backed by strong community support. This has not only led to significant price spikes but also to a more engaged and vibrant crypto community


◇The Role of Airdrops and Community Engagement


A key factor in the success of Solana memecoins has been the strategic use of airdrops and community engagement. The BONK airdrop, for example, generated immense hype and drove token adoption, demonstrating the powerful influence of well-executed marketing strategies in the memecoin market. These memecoins gain success and adoption through winning the support of their community. These coins are truly the money of the people and should not be overlooked as merely a joke.


◇Low Market Cap Players Making Waves


One of the appeals of meme coins is the allure of finding low market cap coins that have the potential to 100x in value as their market cap increases. Typically these projects share a few key characteristics: strong communities, big marketing budgets, and a strong meme concept. This week we’ve seen new coins like Powsche (POWSCHE) grow from a $7K market cap to $500K in a matter of days, built off the back of the “need money for Porsche” meme. Although many of these projects go on to hit $100 million market caps, they inevitably crash back down when the hype dies down.


◇Looking Beyond the Hype


While the hype around memecoins is undeniable, it's essential to approach this trend with a critical eye. The volatile nature of memecoins means that while there are opportunities for significant gains, there are also risks of equally significant losses. As always, doing your due diligence and not investing more than you can afford to lose is crucial.


◇The Future of Solana Memecoins


As we look to the future, the rise of Solana memecoins in 2024 could mark just the beginning of a broader trend. With technological advancements, favorable market sentiment, and a positive regulatory environment, the stage is set for memecoins to continue their ascent.


What are your thoughts on the rise of Solana memecoins? Have you invested in any, or are you watching from the sidelines?

SOL,CryptoMarkets,Everything is a SCAM. ,"It's disheartening to see so many people talking about crypto being a scam. Most of the crypto Reddit forums are bearish which makes me more bullish. It is impossible for crypto to be a scam. The code, the blockchain, they aren't inheritly scammy. Crypto is the only industry where everybody is blamed for the actions of a few bad actors. 

In the 1920s people were over leveraging their positions in stocks. Then the market crashed. 
Were stocks a scam? 

After the markets crashed a guy named Charles Ponzi created a scheme where you couldn't lose money. He promised a fixed return of 50% in 90 days. Thousands of people still reeling from the crash of the 1920s put what they could in Charles investment scheme. You should know what happened next. Charles gave people pieces of paper and they gave him money. 
Was money a scam? 

Bernie Madoff ran the same Ponzi scheme 60 years later. He was smart enough to only promise 15% per year. But he told people it was from trading, when it was really just a scam. Bernie was found guilty. But stocks and investments kept on. 

Crypto has gone through numerous of these disaster situations. The latest ones are the ones I believe are affecting your mental the most. One of them was Sam Bankman Fried. There was nothing elusive or slick about what he did. You deposited money into his exchange and he put that into his personal account. People who had the power to stop him were too close to the situation because they were invested themselves. He also took rival cryptos he didn't like and sold them to drive the narrative that Solana was superior to everything else. 

Luna was a design flaw. It was going to crash eventually. People signed up on a proprietary website without any 3rd party validation and once again thought they were getting 20% interest. The interest was in a mintable token so to maintain the rate all they had to do was turn on the money printer. 

Newsflash this is how the current money system plays out. You put money in a bank and the bank promises you an interest rate. The rate just happens to be a bit lower than the federal rate. Translation the bank is paying your ""interest"" backed by the government which can't fail. All the government has to do is print more money. This is how the entire monetary system plays out. Is the entire monetary system a scam? (hehe you won't like my answer) 

There are bad actors in every part of the financial system. But you don't blame stocks when a single company crashes. You don't blame the money when you get scammed. But when crypto scams happen you blame the entire industry. 

Crypto is here to stay, and there's lots of opportunity in it. But not if you focus on the negative. ",198,2024-08-20 12:49:38,200

SOL,CryptoMarkets,Solana's Transactions Unmasked: Going Beyond the Numbers,"Hello, blockchain enthusiasts!

Solana has certainly made waves as one of the fastest blockchains, boasting an impressive 65,000 transactions per second on their website. It's undeniably impressive, right? But let's not just marvel at the numbers; let's take a deeper dive into real-time TPS and understand what those transactions are all about.

**Our journey begins at** [**explorer.solana.com**](https://explorer.solana.com/), where we'll verify Solana's self-proclaimed TPS. As of this post, it's an impressive 4,651 transactions per second. But what's beneath this number's surface?

Next, we'll step up our game. We're taking Solana's endpoint and connecting directly to the blockchain. No block explorers or user interfaces to confuse us. We'll use the getBlock RPC method to extract transactions from specific blocks, providing a JSON file with a transaction set.

Here's the fascinating part: as we analyze these transactions, we'll notice a recurring theme – many of them bear a ""Vote111111111111111111111111111111111111111"" marker. Curious, right? Well, it turns out Solana includes voting transactions in their block space. These transactions, submitted by validators, play a crucial role in network consensus.

Taking an example block, [Dqfab19Ggaru7zAr1G8hC4gTvbC9YZ63wHc1HgFVsGHK](https://explorer.solana.com/block/215265250?filter=all), we find **2,198** transactions. However, here's the catch – a whopping **2,074** of these belong to voting transactions, with only **124** categorized as regular blockchain transactions (think SOL transfers or smart contracts).

**But why does this matter?** Well, here's the deal: comparing the speed and quality of different blockchains solely based on raw metrics like TPS is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. It's crucial to dig deeper and understand a blockchain's architecture before making comparisons.

If you're interested, you can conveniently check real-time TPS for various blockchains at [chainspect.app](https://chainspect.app/). No need to hassle with connecting to blockchain endpoints or deep dives into network architecture. It's all about making informed comparisons.

Let's keep the discussion going! What are your thoughts on Solana's TPS and its impact on the blockchain landscape?",3,2023-09-03 09:16:34,6

SOL,CryptoMarkets,SOL Analysis: Why Solana might be the next big move for small-cap investors in 2024,"Been seeing a lot of discussions about entry-level crypto investments lately, and I wanted to dive deeper into why SOL (Solana) is catching attention as a promising mid-term play.

Key points worth considering:

1. Price Accessibility

* Currently trading at a fraction of ETH's price
* Allows newer investors to own whole units rather than fractions
* Lower entry barrier compared to other L1s

1. Technical Advantages

* Significantly faster transaction speeds (65,000 TPS)
* Lower gas fees compared to ETH
* Growing developer ecosystem

1. Recent Developments

* Major DeFi projects migrating to Solana
* Increased institutional interest
* Strong recovery from FTX fallout showing resilience

However, important risks to consider:

* Network stability issues (though improving)
* Competition from other L1 solutions
* Market volatility

For those looking to get exposure to SOL, consider DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) instead of going all in. You might also want to look into copy trading established portfolios that include SOL alongside other assets for better risk management.

SOL,CryptoMarkets,"I plan to dca $2000 every month in BTC, ETH and SOL for 5-10 years - what are realistic expectations for this?","As the title says; I plan on putting in around $2000 into crypto every month. 50% BTC, 25% ETH and 25% SOL for upwards of 10 years. I'm fully aware that it is impossible to tell how the market will be in such a long time, but by following how it has gone the last 10 years - what can I expect from my investments?

What kind of exit plan should I have? I hope to be able to have around $1mil in 5 years through investing heavily in crypto to be able to secure my future, but I feel this might be wishful thinking and is not a realistic goal to have.

You might ask why SOL? Honestly, I believe in it - and what I am investing into it every month over a span of 5 years is an amount I can afford to lose if it doesn't work out for me. So if it pays off, then thats just a huge bonus for me.

Keep in mind I already have a indexfund account and am saving there monthly as well.",0,2024-08-09 20:30:09,30

SOL,CryptoMarkets,"Side-by-Side Comparison of BGSOL, BNSOL, and bbSOL Liquid Staking Tokens for Solana","Alright, if you’re into staking on Solana but still want to keep things liquid, you’ve probably come across BGSOL, BNSOL, and bbSOL. These tokens basically let you earn staking rewards while staying flexible with your assets. I did a little digging, so here’s a quick comparison to help you figure out which one might suit you best.

# Estimated APR & Earnings

* **BGSOL**: This one’s got a solid base APR of **8.15%**, but with extra incentives from Bitget, it can hit **30.15%**. Plus, if you stake the first **$1,000** via Bitget Wallet on the Solayer Restaking Network, you can earn **up to 25% APY**. Not too shabby, right?
* **BNSOL**: The APR here is **dynamic**, but Binance hasn’t shared exact numbers (thanks, Binance 🙄).
* **bbSOL**: No fees at all – **0% management fee, 0% validator commission,** and **0% withdrawal fees**. The only cost is a **0.1% SOL deposit fee**. So if you're allergic to fees, bbSOL might be the move.

# Redemption & Liquidity

* **BGSOL**: No lock-in period – you can **redeem whenever** you feel like it.
* **BNSOL**: There’s a **4-day wait** if you want to convert BNSOL back to SOL.
* **bbSOL**: It’s **tradeable** on Bybit and other exchanges. The info I found didn’t say if there’s a waiting period, so it seems pretty chill on that front.

# Where You Can Use These Tokens

* **BGSOL**: Works across a bunch of DeFi platforms like **Orca Dex, Solayer, Kamino**, and **Save Lending**. Also gets you access to Bitget’s **LaunchPool and PoolX**, plus potential **airdrops**.
* **BNSOL**: Mostly useful on **Binance** for **trading, lending**, or adding to **liquidity pools**.
* **bbSOL**: You can use it with **Orca, Kamino**, and **Solayer** – nice little DeFi ecosystem going on here.

# What Makes Each One Special

* **BGSOL**: Comes with **Active Validator Set (AVS) delegation**, making it faster and more secure.
* **BNSOL**: Super simple with a **one-click staking process** and the usual Binance-level security and support.
* **bbSOL**: It’s the **first exchange-backed LST** and runs on the **SPL stake pool program**, which has gone through a bunch of audits.

# So, Which One’s Right for You?

Honestly, it all comes down to what you’re after:

* If you want **higher APR** and more **DeFi options**, go with **BGSOL**.
* If you’re already using **Binance** a lot, **BNSOL** makes sense.
* If you hate fees and like **trading your tokens freely**, **bbSOL** is the way to go.

  
So yeah, for me BGSOL really seems to steal the spotlight, especially if you’re looking for high rewards, flexibility, and utility. What do you guys think? Let me know would love to hear your thoughts!

SOL,CryptoMarkets,Keep an eye on SOL and LUNA,"For the traders that keep funds in the sidelines, keep an eye on Solana and Terra. Both have reached price discovery and had some good retests over the last week. 

Both of these are going to be very good holds for the next few weeks. I'm sure most of you think ""yea, obviously those are good coins"" to that, but I wanted to make this post as a reminder to anyone looking to pack more bags or expand their portfolios. 

[SOL](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8ZNsyfr9/) shows the retest of all time high that just happened. And if you look at the [zoomed in chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/NnF8qyAl/) you can see a falling channel has broken out today. From this point, solana should steady climb with the possibility of making a parabolic move. 

[LUNA](https://www.tradingview.com/x/UNLK2HZo/) the dotted line on this chart is simply a perspective support level. I'd love for it to hold perfectly because it'll set luna up for a parabolic move. Regardless, it's still sitting on the previous ATH and is just loading for ore upside.

This is very basic TA and I'm not saying anything new here, but if you don't own solana or luna, I'd say you'd be very safe to expand your portfolio over to them for a nice mid-term hold.

Ofc they can grow and its Not over for those but If you think dame it i Wish i would knew it earlyer about shiba.
SolDoge is your Chance marketcap of only 2,2milion He can easy do X10 - x100 and He only has a Marketcap of 20million- 200 Million cause supply is 10 Billion.
They also have own NFT and new Roadmap is on the way.
Dont be to late and think dame i missed IT again.

In 2023, Solana Labs is going to release its own mobile phone, Saga. It is set to introduce new crypto experiences for pros and newbies. 

Solana Mobile Stack (SMS) is an ecosystem of Solana-centric mobile applications for Android devices. Among other things, it includes Mobile Wallet Adapter that allows integrating [Solana](https://getblock.io/nodes/sol/) (SOL) wallets into mobile applications, and its native Web3 payment system Solana Pay.

More applications will be released in Solana’s dApps store. SMS developer kit (SDK) is the first element of the upcoming [Solana](https://getblock.io/nodes/sol/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) (SOL) mobile ecosystem; it is now available for Web3 devs.

In terms of hardware, the upcoming Solana’s mobile phone Saga will be a competitor to core high-end models with its Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor, 6.67” OLED display, 12GB RAM, and 512GB of storage.

The token overtook [Ripple (XRP)](https://getblock.io/nodes/xrp/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) and [Cardano (ADA)](https://getblock.io/nodes/ada/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) jumping two spots in the list on Thursday.

Basically it jumped nearly 17% over the past seven days and was last trading around $120, its highest level since late-November. The token also rose 0.4% in the past 24 hours, while the broader crypto market fell around 5%.

The token surged through the second half of March. It had earlier this week overtaken Terra (LUNA) to take the no. 8 spot in the top 10 cryptocurrencies.

So we're really bullish about SOL, and actually [recently our SOL node's been updated to v1.9.12 version](https://getblock.io/nodes/sol/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) is that a coincidence? (don't think so)

SOL,CryptoMarkets,SOL wallet?,"as the title reads i need a wallet for my crypto and i got a couple questions regarding staking, having a wallet and 
investing in general. atm i use binance btw

so first off how does a wallet work? 
i didn’t wanna download one before getting advice from reddit ( i know, terrible idea but i hate sitting through videos)

what exactly is staking? 
I’ve got 3.5 SOL. if i stake them. what do i do with them. how? what’s in it for me? what are the risks? 
also what about extremely cheap coins like XEC? since they fluctuate more, does this mean that you can either win or lose money fast? 

are there coins that you can earn by playing games? i thought a mate told me about one..?

appreciate any and every comment with a reply xx tia",1,2021-10-04 18:16:12,3

SOL,CryptoMarkets,Is it worth holding bitcoin for this bull run?,"For context, I don’t have huge amounts invested and it’s an amount that won’t hurt me if I lose it all. 
I currently have 40% of my portfolio in bitcoin, 20% in eth, 20% in sol and the rest in other smaller cap alts. But I’m thinking that at best my portfolio will maybe 3x (which would still be great but as I said it won’t hurt me losing it all so I kinda wanna gamble a bit more) If I want to try get bigger gains is it worth selling bitcoin for something else? I’m thinking maybe SOL or SUI or some other promising alt coins.

SOL,CryptoMarkets,Am I a degen to have 50% of my portfolio in ADA? ,"Please elaborate, why I might be if you think so. 

I used to hodl LTC hard and switched over to ADA last summer at an okey price. Now doubt is crawling in whether its the right investment for this bullrun. There is no narrative, on-chain activity, devs (researched and compared to other chains on intotheblock) etc. are not that convincing. I ""need"" it to go to 6 $ to reach my financial goals. 

Tbh I can see a **\~**300 k BTC end of next year and could have just tried to ride that wave (though something around 200 k is more probable, obviously). 

SOL is a real shitcoin in it's fundamentals so thats why I despise to invest big in it, also it might 4X from here on most likely, tops (all speculation is out of my arse, of course). Didn't ever go that hard into ETH for same reason (don't believe in that eco system).

So ADA imho is the way to go when talking technology, but Hoskinson is a questionable guy and the token has zero narrative this season till now. 

Whats your thoughts?

SOL,CryptoMarkets,Easiest way to totally exit crypto ( turn everything back into cash ) ?,"Hello everyone.

I'm a 40 y/o from Bucharest, Romania. 3 years ago today ( yes, it was actually 15.11.2021 believe it or not ) I decided to go into crypto, NFT's & play to earn games, after about 1 month of reading as much as I could about everything.

Initially started by having someone rent me a team in Axie Infinity, hated it ( I suck at those kind of games, evem though I really don't suck at broader known game genres ), looked for others stuff and got into multiple projects, metaverse stuff ( Decentraland and I guess Sandbox is also into that category ), a handful of move to earn apps and a few other games. To be noted that everything except ETH, POL and SOL is based on those chains and games related ( I'm a core PC gamer basically and got drawn by the whole ""own the items"" pitch ).

At this point in time over 50% of the smaller project I invested in have rugged / slow rugged ( or whatever, they're gone ). Others are not doing so well as the hype died. Others I guess are trying their best and still going hard at it but I really lost faith that any of my crypto assets will ever get back at even the initial value I invested.

Honestly... I'm kinda done with the whole thing. I probably also lack the time, knowledge and skills to make some really good moves that would end in some palpable profits. So I decided to sell everything. The problem is I've been out of the loop for so long ( 1 year of nothing and 1 year of on & off ) that I have no clue what the easiest way to do this would be.

85-90% of what I own is in my Metamask and Phantom wallets. Only Cex I used was Binance but I have nothing on it, just used it to get crypto and then get it on my Metamask / Phantom wallets. I also have several NFTs on ETH and a few on SOL. I just want it all sold, NFTs to cryto and crypto to cash, on my Revolut or Debit Card ( bank is BRD Groupe Societe Generale ).

I have 100k at my disposal. It’s everything that I ‘can’t afford to lose’ as Saylor says.  I won’t need it for at least 3 years, but I’m 21 and this is not a trivial amount to me. 

Seriously, would you buy right now, or should I wait for bitcoin to crash/correct again? I understand the new ‘floor’ might be around 50k-60k. But this cycle really does seem to be consistent with others and I know it’ll come back down with 6-18 months. 

At the same time I think trump might have a pretty big positive impact on this bull run and don’t want to miss out.

I’m not asking anyone to predict the future, just keen to hear sentiment and advice. 


Edit:

Thanks everyone for the responses.
You'll be relieved to hear that am I also getting advice from adults who are not on reddit, but I really do appreciate everyone's thoughts, it was a lot more objective and considerate than I expected!
I'm going to put 50k in. I've put 10k in so far. Bank has stopped me from moving the rest so l'll have to figure that out on the weekend.
Then convert 25k to USDC and I aim to DCA from there. Might just watch the price for a bit though.
I'm not going to sell if it goes down, even if it hits $2.
I might take a little bit of profit if we hit 200k or something though. Like 10%.
I'm going to look at leaving the rest in a high yield savings account or an ETF.
It anyone has some threads or links that will help me better understand self ownership and security, I'd appreciate it. I understand it but am not really tech savvy so l'm keen for a simplified step by step breakdown.
Thanks again, for all of your sakes I hope it takes off and I regret not going all in!",291,2024-07-22 10:36:05,638
SOL,Bitcoin,In case you die with BTC...,"Looking for advice: I have a decent sized portfolio, mostly BTC and it's all on Ledger.  My father is in his 80s and not very good with computers.  I've tried to teach him how to use it but it's not happening.  What should I do to prepare for the hopefully unlikely event that I die before him?  I also have a sister but she's terrible with computers also and I don't trust her.  I want them to have everything if the worst happens.

Thoughts?

BTW, I had a very expensive accountant help me out with my crypto taxes and thought that I could instruct my father to have him help but I didn't use that accountant this year because I stopped trading and didn't need someone at his level doing my taxes anymore.

EDIT:  Thanks for the advice, everybody.  Lots to look into, for sure.  I was in the hospital during the epidemic for two months and almost died so this has been on my mind for a while.  While in the hospital I moved off almost all the exchanges and consolidated everything onto Coinbase and Ledger but when I was writing out instructions for the latter, I knew it was going to be an uphill battle.",455,2024-05-05 23:13:29,472

SOL,Bitcoin,"RIP HAL FINNEY ""His last post on a BTC Forum"""," 

I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.

Edit: more than a year down the line no one will see this so this is more for myself. The OP was a copy pasta but this year has changed my life. All thanks to crypto

SOL,Bitcoin,"Don't Get Rekt in This Bull Run: Remember the 2017 ""Earn"" Scams?","
Just say this ad being promoted while scrolling on Reddit. Seriously?!? Again? 

With Bitcoin pumping like a 12-cylinder lambo on NOS, it's natural to get greedy. We've all been there, staring at that green dildo and thinking, ""There's gotta be a way to squeeze some extra sats out of this rocketing orange peel.""

But before you ape into the latest ""earn"" or ""lend"" platform promising double-digit APYs, remember the fate of your 2017 brethren who were seduced by similar sirens.

Celsius Network, anyone? They were promising 25% returns on BTC deposits, all the way up until they filed for bankruptcy last June, leaving thousands of hodlers with nothing but a big, fat, frozen middle finger. And let's not forget FTX, who were offering up to 8% on BTC lending. They, too, went tits up a few months later, taking a sizable chunk of their users' coins with them.

These weren't just some shady fly-by-night operations. These were seemingly reputable platforms that got hyped by big influencers and backed by even bigger VC money. Yet, when the market inevitably turned south, they crumbled like overleveraged sandcastles.

So, what's the lesson here?

Not your keys, not your coins.

If you're not the one holding the private keys, you don't really own your Bitcoin. You're just trusting some stranger with your financial future, and history shows that's a recipe for disaster.

Sure, the potential returns from these ""earn"" platforms might be tempting. But is it worth risking your entire stack on a promise that could vanish overnight? Remember, there's no such thing as free sats. If someone is offering you sky-high returns on your Bitcoin, they're probably doing something shady to make it happen.

So, please please please please x 21M, let's keep our wits about us in this bull run. Don't get blinded by greed and fall for the same scams that snagged so many in 2017. Remember, the safest place for your Bitcoin is always your own cold wallet.

Stay frosty, stack sats, and hodl on tight.",229,2024-01-29 13:18:14,93

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency just like all those shitcoins, that’s just how such digital coins are being called… it’s the same like an eagle is a bird, same as a chicken is, but i guess we can all agree that they are definitely not the same animal

the reason why bitcoiners don’t like it to be compared to the altcoins is that bitcoin is the only digital coin which is capable of storing value since its amount is limited, hence it can’t be inflated and will always keep its value (not like all those fiat currencies and altcoins which can be printed/generated out of nothing)

it’s like digital gold, with the difference that its real value isn’t known yet so it can (and will) jump much higher than gold in the long run",3,2024-06-25 10:58:44,35

I know this is a question often asked and I've read a few past threads, but as things change quickly, I'm asking for your advice.

I live 60/40 Europe/USA and after reading quite a bit, I would like to finally start working with cryptos a bit. Small purchases for now, nothing much (under 1k per month).

Among the various Wallets and Exchanges these seem interesting to me:

* Okx
* Mt Pelerin
* Kraken
* Strike
* Coinbase
* Lykke (not anymore I guess...)

but I know there are a ton of them and I would like some advice even if they are not the ones listed.

These above should all be KYC, I don't know if the non-KYC ones can be trusted, but if there are any interesting ones please tell me so I can look.

Obviously, as I am starting out, I am very interested that the fees are as low as possible even with small amounts.

Also, I would like to quickly take what I purchased to a cold wallet without leaving too much money in the hot wallet and again I am asking for your advice sun a good device that is easy to work with and connect quickly.

Thank you all and a happy day!

While some think that Bitcoin is just a highly speculative asset, a group of strong believers termed “maximalists” project that Bitcoin will become a dominant global currency that overthrows the dollar one day. Though initially sceptical, researching this article took me down a rabbit-hole…

What is Bitcoin? Where does its value come from? Does it have the properties needed to make it a viable form of currency? Can it fuel a thriving economy? What are Bitcoin’s weak points? Which are its competitors? How will governments respond to its rise to power? Can Bitcoin become the new Gold Standard?

Strap in for a rollercoaster ride through the past, present and future of Bitcoin!

A brief history of money

Historians agree that humans invented money before they invented written language. Think about that. We were able to agree on how to exchange value before we were able to write down our thoughts. The origins of money are more fundamental to human nature than our desire to communicate, in a way.

Money served three purposes:

* A store of wealth across time. People could store today's effort for using it tomorrow.
* A medium of exchange, to procure things from others.
* A unit of account, to record credit-debit relationships.

Starting with the barter system, humans moved on to using common goods with intrinsic value (such as cows and bags of wheat) and then to units like cowrie shells, glass beads which were more convenient for accounting because of their **divisibility.** There was a problem with this system, though. You guessed it.

https://preview.redd.it/7akckhof8j181.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=07d44f3848d3904a377476bbb822816264b4a38c

People who had access to the means of production of cowrie shells or glass beads could flood the market, *and the more money there was in the market, the less value it had.* This is what happened in Africa when glass beads merchants from Europe imported loads of glass beads and made them worthless as a form of money. (This could be one of the first recorded instances of **inflation**).

**Gold** was a solution to the cheap creation of money. Mining gold is a difficult task. Flooding the supply of money was difficult unless people took the effort to mine gold, for which they were compensated. But the quality of gold could always be debased and there was no way to check its authenticity.

Governments took on the responsibility of **controlling the supply** and **guaranteeing the validity** of money. This has always worked fine until it hasn't. As long as the government acts in a neutral capacity to do the best thing for the economy, there is no problem. But the people who are closest to the means of production of money - Kings, Central Bankers, Cabinet Members - also have the most incentive to confiscate a large share for themselves. Or they could follow a monetary policy that might make them look good in the short term while throwing the system into chaos in the long run. This can be seen in the case of the Fall of Rome and Constantinople, the hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, the shift of the US and other countries away from the Gold standard \[1\], and the inflation that is looming over the US right now.

Looking at history, what would the perfect currency look like?

* **Convenient to handle.** It should be divisible, portable, safe to store, and easy to transact with. Units should be interchangeable (fungible).
* **Credible.** The validity of the money should be guaranteed in some way, either by its intrinsic value or by some mechanism such as the backing of a counterparty (like the Government).
* **Liquid.** It should be easy to find people who accept payment with it.
* **Secure.** If the money can be compromised, it cannot store wealth.
* **Inflation resistant.** It should be hard to create and resistant to control by small groups of people with vested interests.
* **Stable.** The value should not have significant volatility.

The most important requirement though is that people **adopt it** en masse. Money is a collective story that people believe in, a story that lets them exchange value with each other. If an ecosystem is built around this story, it gives the money more value, further strengthening people's beliefs.

**How does Bitcoin do on these grounds?** Let us start by understanding what Bitcoin is and why it is so different from existing forms of money.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a **decentralized** digital **cryptocurrency** that can be used for **peer-to-peer transactions** through a **distributed ledger.** Let's unpack that.

* **Bitcoin is decentralized.** There is no government, organization, or single authority that controls the policies of Bitcoin.
* **Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency** \- A form of digitized money whose units cannot be duplicated.
* **Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions** \- There is no reliance on a central banking system.
* **Bitcoin operates through a distributed ledger** \- A copy of every transaction ever made on the Bitcoin network is stored in all the nodes of the network! But because each transaction is anonymized, you can effectively check only your own transactions.

Bitcoin was invented in 2008 (in the throes of the housing crisis market crash) by a figure named Satoshi Nakamoto whose real identity is unknown. Satoshi open-sourced the code to Bitcoin after publishing a white paper about it, and as more people started adopting it, Satoshi vanished mysteriously.

https://preview.redd.it/nnpbdr6h8j181.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=41f367db0a2fd213e829b8a37284fd75e8789fc0

To the layman, Bitcoin is currently just like any other stock or asset that you can exchange dollars for. To use Bitcoin, all that is needed is a wallet that gives the user a **public address** that others can transact with, and a **private key** that acts as a password. Bitcoin can be bought at **cryptocurrency exchanges** or mined (will be explained shortly). This is then stored in software or hardware wallets, and exchanged for products or services with other users. There is no central authority over Bitcoin.

Each Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million units called Satoshis for convenience.

Since 2008, Bitcoin has grown in leaps and bounds to become a dominant force in the market and people's imagination. But...

Where does Bitcoin get its value from?

We saw earlier that if it’s easy to make money, anybody can flood the market and destroy its value. This was also the reason for gold's adoption for minting coins because gold is very hard to produce (apart from being nice and shiny).

The government's ability to print massive amounts of money is the chief danger to modern forms of money. Imagine you have a million dollars and it’s worthless tomorrow because a bunch of people in the government thought it's alright to print another quadrillion dollars. That's the fear which drives people to invest in real estate, stocks, gold, and other commodities. **There is no alternative government-backed currency in circulation today that qualifies as ""hard money""**, whose supply is restricted.

That's one of Bitcoin's chief attractions. Bitcoin is *extremely hard to produce* and *has a cap on its supply*. Each block that needs to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain (distributed ledger) needs to be identified by a number that satisfies a mathematical property. \[2\] Bitcoins are produced by ""miners"" who try to find these numbers by running through millions of options in a brute-force manner. When miners hit upon a successful candidate, **they are rewarded in Bitcoins**. This is a highly energy-intensive process and the profit that the miners get is in the thin margin between electricity consumption and the value of the bitcoin.

https://preview.redd.it/1pced6gi8j181.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ed333c93c9aff06f29350bd7654fb053ac15d83

The physical exchange of energy for bitcoin is similar to expending effort in mining gold. The second feature is that **there can be only 21 million Bitcoins in existence**, ever. This is a hard feature of its code that cannot be changed. \[3\] 20 million Bitcoin would be mined by 2025 (by current estimates). By 2140, all of the Bitcoin would be mined, and the incentive for miners will be in the form of transaction fees. As the supply of Bitcoin is finite, **it cannot be devalued by increasing the supply** making it inflation resistant by design.

There is no central authority for Bitcoin. The code is open-sourced, and if anybody wants to change it, it has to be with the consensus of all the nodes in the network. For example, when some security vulnerabilities were identified in Bitcoin in 2018, a fork (change in the code) was done to patch it which was accepted by all users as it was for their benefit \[4\]. But when **hard forks** (major changes) were done to create new currencies like Bitcoin Cash, the bulk of users chose to stay on the existing network, causing Bitcoin Cash's value to drop sharply. Hence, **Bitcoin's value is decided by the consensus of the network.**

The above points show that Bitcoin is ***convenient, inflation resistant, secure, and credible*** (its validity is backed by a mathematical function that is impossible to break or fake).

This tells us about the **perceived value** of Bitcoin, but if the aim of Bitcoin is to capture the existing market, it also needs to be:

1. Liquid and exchangeable with existing currencies
2. Fuel for a thriving economy
3. Stable

How does Bitcoin do on these fronts?

Liquidity

Let's be real here. Most people are interested in Bitcoin not because of its fascinating mathematical properties or promise of inflation resistance. It's because of the **“Number go up”** that every influencer is shouting about on Twitter as if it’s their personal achievement. That's the reason Bitcoin tends to get on the nerves of some people too: **How is it that believers of an imaginary concept with no “value” or “business” behind it are rewarded time and again without any effort?**

The misconception here is that Bitcoin is being compared with businesses on the stock market which grow with time because of their value proposition and execution. Bitcoin is better compared with gold whose value is dictated by **scarcity.** The problem is that, unlike gold which has intrinsic value, Bitcoin's value is entirely dependent on the faith that people have in **the story around it.**

The story around Bitcoin is this:

**“Bitcoin is the hardest form of money and will eventually replace all currencies.”**

People who adhere to this vision are called **Bitcoin Maximalists.** And in terms of the stories out there, Bitcoin is one of the fastest proliferating. It makes sense. When personal incentive is tied with a story, the FOMO kicks in of being penniless when Bitcoin takes over. The possibility of gain makes people buy into it in droves. **And as people buy into it, demand rises, and its price goes up further.**

**Bitcoin's strongest point is also its weakest. Decentralization.**

Though Bitcoin claims to be “decentralized”, that's only if Bitcoin becomes money in itself. To convert from dollar to Bitcoin, you still need **the presence of exchanges.** These exchanges are among the most loosely regulated financial entities in the world and the most vulnerable to government regulation. For example, Tether, which debuted as a *Stablecoin* (a cryptocurrency pegged to a commodity or government-backed currency) has repeatedly come under scrutiny for its shady accounting practices. \[5\] Tether also turned out to be owned by the same people who owned Bitfinex, a large cryptocurrency exchange. **It is one of the biggest intermediaries for Bitcoin to Dollar liquidity out there, and a collapse on that front due to regulations might cause a mad rush to exit.**

Of course, Bitcoin maximalists will argue that if one exchange goes down, another will come up, and we will learn from our mistakes. But is there enough incentive to learn from our mistakes? Shouldn't Bitcoin be actually **useful for buying things?**

The Bitcoin economy - and competitors

One of the biggest jokes in the history of Bitcoin was when Laszlo Hanyecz of Florida traded 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas. That would be worth $574 million today, maybe the costliest meal ever. \[6\] But that was one of the first recorded instances of **a physical good bought with Bitcoin.**

https://preview.redd.it/zjyphu8l8j181.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=b518e681fb09313178c602ee0d06d9a363a803e2

Since then, there has been a rapid increase in the adoption of Bitcoin as a mode of payment. From retail needs to domain names, from cars to travel packages to restaurants to cellular service, the scope of Bitcoin has expanded tremendously.\[7\] There's even a house on sale that you can buy **exclusively with Bitcoin.** But there are things that you **cannot** buy with Bitcoin yet. There's no direct provision to buy stocks on the NASDAQ (or any other market) with cryptocurrencies, for example.

A big market for Bitcoin is their programmability - **Smart Contracts will automate the market of trust.** People don't need to believe that someone else will pay them back on time and spend time in legal battles. A clause like “If rains don't arrive, farmers get paid insurance” can be automated to simplify the market of crop insurance. But this is also a space where Bitcoin has tough competition.

Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and a handful of other cryptocurrency blockchains (with tokens called *AltCoins*) sprouted to tackle problems that Bitcoin couldn’t. Bitcoin Maximalists argue that Bitcoin has the first-mover advantage and anything other currencies can do, Bitcoin can absorb into its code - But the facts speak otherwise. When Ether started out, its trading volume was only a fraction of Bitcoin’s, but after Ether started catering to the NFT and DAO space, **it's now a serious threat to Bitcoin’s dominance**. Other cryptos assert that they do different things in a better manner compared to Bitcoin. Dogecoin was a mere joke till someone catapulted it to prominence. [I'm looking at you, Elon.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1396698902842122244?s=20)

But one thing is for sure - It’s very difficult for a new entrant to the Altcoin space to gain traction and reach ***while standing for the same principles that Bitcoin does.*** There is so much awareness about cryptocurrencies now that the bulk of a new Altcoin offering will be bought out by a single entity. And that makes the cryptocurrency useless because its value is in its reach.

**It's not money unless everyone believes it is.**

A strong warning is in place here: When I say a new cryptocurrency is useless, I’m talking about the long term. Coin Offerings have a very strong possibility of being a Ponzi scheme, so be VERY VERY careful with where you put your money.

There's just one more reason that Bitcoin and other Altcoins are still not widespread in their use.

Volatility

Bitcoin is very volatile compared to the US Dollar. This is something that even maximalists don't argue with. It is not clear whether volatility is increasing or decreasing with time and trading volume, but you can't use something as **money** if you don't know what it will be worth days, hours, even minutes from now. This is the reason Bitcoin is the butt of so many jokes like this:

>A 10 year old boy asks his father for a [#BitCoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitCoin?src=hashtag_click)📷 for his birthday. Dad can I please have just one BitCoin for my birthday as a gift ? Father: What ? Why the hell you need $ 14,433 Do you know $ 15,367 is a lot of money. What would you do with $ 12,456 dollars ?

But the assertion is that on the ***technology adoption curve***, Bitcoin is still in the early majority stage, and the amount of capital that has been injected into Bitcoin is minuscule compared to how much more can be injected (The figures are based on growth in Market Cap, number of users, and number of transactions - Unreliable, because one individual can have any number of Bitcoin Addresses and transactions could be just buying and selling of Bitcoin, not retail transactions).

https://preview.redd.it/mha3u2hm8j181.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfc02d49dc659dd8ffe651f5945974fa046cbf7a

Here we enter the realm of speculation. We must understand that Bitcoin is the first of its kind - A resource that is absolutely scarce, meaning that it is the first deflationary money. Some assert that the inbuilt scarcity will make volatility an inevitable feature of Bitcoin, rather than a bug. \[9\] Supporters of Bitcoin assert that as we cross over from early majority to late majority in the adoption curve, Bitcoin will start seeing massive adoption and this will stabilize the price (How exactly? I’m not sure. I don't have enough know-how to assess this).

All this talk is fine, but everybody gangsta till the big daddy of money steps in.

Will the Government be sleeping?

Bitcoin started out in anonymity and it was then laughed off as a joke. Later, governments started referring to it as a highly speculative asset, and now there are murmurs that Bitcoin is going to overthrow the monopoly that the Government has over money. El Salvador has accepted Bitcoin as legal tender and announced that it would be starting the world's first ""Bitcoin City"". What on earth is going on?

In the standard narrative about Bitcoin, after Bitcoin starts gaining mass adoption there comes a phase where some Central Bank starts getting shifty about the hyperinflation that is rampant in the economy, and starts **buying Bitcoin to hedge against the possibility of economic collapse.** Other banks follow suit, doing the same, and when rumors break out, the citizens start buying up Bitcoin and rapid adoption of Bitcoin follows suit with Bitcoin replacing the dominant currency of the country. This phase is called **hyperbitcoinization.**

That sounds great, except that the government isn't going to take this lying down. Apart from the ominous angle that money is one of the chief ways that the government uses to control its citizens, there is one logical reason that the government will oppose Bitcoin: **The government needs to pay its employees** and it has no means of production to produce or purchase Bitcoin scalably. How will public institutions sustain themselves in the absence of cash flow? There seems to be a dreamlike scenario where the government voluntarily relinquishes power and takes a backseat as all institutions are privatized, but since Satoshi vanished without leaving a manifesto on how legal institutions and the military will be funded, there seems to be a gaping hole in this grand scheme.

There is no doubt that Bitcoin will play an important role in the world economy. Even now, [Bitcoin's market cap ranks it as 14th in the list of world economies](https://coinmarketcap.com/fiat-currencies/) (with Ether at 25th). World countries switched to the gold standard when gold emerged as the hardest form of money and then switched to pegging themselves against the dollar. **It is highly likely that Bitcoin (or other Altcoins) will be a standard/commodity in the future.** But instead of Bitcoin overthrowing governments, or governments banning Bitcoin (which is very resource-intensive and difficult), it is more likely that governments will **assimilate Bitcoin into their legal framework.** Bitcoin might be taxed, its use cases monitored and transactions tracked. \[10\] Though the Indian and Chinese governments banned Bitcoin, India is now taking a softer stance by trying to tax cryptocurrency gains heavily. The lasting change might actually be in terms of **the inability of governments to manipulate the price of Bitcoin.**

And though hyperbitcoinization sounds cool (or ridiculous, depending on how you see it), it is not realistic or even desirable. The real meaning of this scenario sounds like a breakdown of world government (highly unlikely) \[11\]. Hopefully, it doesn't get that far.

A bitcoinized world: Good, bad or ugly?

The advantages of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are touted as follows:

1. Greater freedom of the individual
2. Resistance to inflation
3. Delegation of trust to a mathematical system
4. Reduction in government interference

The notion of decentralization has created this idea that Bitcoin is going to create a symmetric world of equal opportunity. There are some counterpoints to that argument:

1. The initial distribution of Bitcoin is hugely skewed. By some accounts, 85% of the entire Bitcoin supply is in the hands of ""whales"" who constitute just 2% of the user base (But this doesn't give them a higher edge unless the Bitcoin economy develops). \[12\]
2. Though Bitcoin promises economic opportunities for the entire world in theory, only about 60% of the world has access to the Internet.
3. Bitcoiners’ claim that Bitcoin is the only competitive cryptocurrency out there is unproven. There is no clear data on how many people believe in Bitcoin **as an asset, as money, and as a novelty.**
4. It isn't that hard for governments to launch **a coordinated attack on cryptocurrencies** \[13\]. The hope is that the political neutrality of Bitcoin and the personal incentive it holds gives it the edge in the long run.
5. Governments and corporations can give incentives by minting their own cryptocurrencies in certain geographical regions or internet spaces, an advantage that Bitcoin cannot outcompete without violating its neutrality.

So will we see Bitcoin rise to ascendance in this century?

Can Bitcoin replace the dollar?

If we consolidate all the points we have seen so far, we can see that Bitcoin is a convenient, portable form of money that gives a lot of freedom to the individual. It has gone from 0 to $56,000 (as of today), crossing a market cap of $1 Trillion in **a mere 13 years (Apple Computers took 38 years to hit the same milestone - with a solid business and advertising team backing it).** Since Bitcoin is a form of money that is native to the internet, the rate at which its story propagates is also phenomenal.

Bitcoin’s true decentralization and first-mover advantage also give it a great advantage over other cryptocurrencies. Though there is tough competition, some of Bitcoin’s core principles like the lack of a central authority give it a real edge (e.g Meta tried to start its own currency Libra/Diem, and it faced regulatory action instantly. Ethereum isn’t truly decentralized either).

The real challenges for Bitcoin are **price stability,** **exclusive use cases,** and **government regulation.** People will only consider Bitcoin money when they are willing to part with it for *something they cannot get* with conventional money. Till then, it’s an asset at most. Although smart contracts and a few niche use cases like NFTs seem to satisfy this, only time will tell if they have a lasting impact.

Price stability is also more likely when Bitcoin has a strong native economy. There are different assertions about its stability - That high-frequency trading is needed to stabilise it, that creation of value will stabilise price, that in spite of boom and bust the new low is always higher than before, that price will stabilise when the number of users keeps growing, and that its price cannot be stabilised as it is an asset. The truth is that nobody has been right at forecasting either its growth or stability reliably and it’s extremely difficult to do so because **we haven’t seen anything like this before.**

Government regulation is the biggest factor. Without all countries of the world having a uniform stance towards Bitcoin, it might just create arbitrage between different countries, not being the “global currency” that it claims to be. Some milestones to watch out for would be:

* The first Central Bank to store Bitcoin as Reserve currency.
* Clear legislation or regulatory action that is favorable to Bitcoin.
* Stock Exchanges trading Bitcoin as a commodity on par with Gold and Oil.

If any of the above happens, it heralds wider acceptance and greater stability. But with government regulation, there is **a greater probability that Bitcoin will coexist with world currencies rather than overthrow them.**

Conclusion

Though the American dollar is ubiquitous today and the central pillar of the global economy, it wasn't always so. The first American dollars were minted in 1792. But it was only in the aftermath of World War 2 in 1944 that the dollar became the standard for other global currencies - 152 years after its inception!

On the contrary, Bitcoin has already become a force to reckon with in just 13 years. It's questionable whether the “market cap” of Bitcoin represents any “real” economic growth, but as more people believe in it, there is more incentive to build an economy around it.

Bitcoin is unlikely to replace the Dollar anytime soon, but the coexistence of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with world currencies is highly likely and something to watch out for. \[14\]

**Footnotes:**

\[1\] The Gold standard is a controversial topic. Some have hailed it as utopian, others think it’s impractical for the global economy to revert to it. We’ll never know for sure as there’s no country that has hard money today.

\[2\] The problem is based on the SHA-256 cipher which relies on the fact that it’s very hard to factorize large numbers. Some suggest that quantum computers might be able to break this, but it’s highly unlikely and if it happens, Bitcoin is the least of our worries - Many security systems rely on SHA-256, including modern banks.

SOL,Bitcoin,The cryptocurrency market in 2021 is much different than the market of 2017,"There is no need to fear: The cryptocurrency market in 2021 is much different than the market of 2017.

Challenges stimulate progress. Technology, pretty much like life itself, cannot be static. Only dynamics stimulate positive changes. Amid the collapse of the cryptocurrency market in mid-May, many retail and institutional investors began to lose faith in the bright future of cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin (BTC) in particular. Corporations and institutions, whales, and early adopters converged in a single impulse — the internet was overwhelmed by a wave of mistrust towards “cryptocurrency number one” as the best defensive asset, superior to gold and everything else that had been invented prior.

One needs to see the full picture here to realize what’s happening. The last time the market suffered more or less comparable and significant losses was a year ago, in March 2020. This year, the panic sell-offs caused by a series of negative events — Elon Musk’s Twitter crusade against BTC, the rumoured court case against Binance and the latest crackdown on crypto from the Chinese government — bring to mind the tremendous collapse of digital assets at the peak of many asset rates in December 2017 and the succeeding “crypto winter”.
However, many people who have little understanding of how the cryptocurrency market functions do not realize the depth of changes that the space has been through in recent years. Emotions are the worst enemy of an investor or trader in a rapidly growing digital asset ecosystem. It is worthwhile to look dispassionately at the facts and analyze the changes to understand the true value of ecosystems growing on the fertile soil of the blockchain.The investment mindset has changed in recent years. Even though it continues to be dominated by a highly speculative component, there is also a practical application for the settlement. Investors switched from short-term speculations to the long game. The number of Bitcoin ATMs has doubled since 2020. This dramatic rise clearly demonstrates a growing demand for the world’s largest crypto assets. From a niche, the cryptocurrency industry has evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry.

Stablecoins — tokens pegged to their corresponding fiat asset such as the U.S. dollar, euro, etc. — have gained significant weight in 2020-2021. With the emergence of new platforms known as decentralized finance, or DeFi, protocols, opportunities appeared to offer profit without risks of the principal asset, for example. Such platforms are nothing more than distributed programs that provide clearing, custody and settlement services. Every year they take a larger piece of the pie from traditional financial institutions. The surge in activity in the environment of decentralized trading platforms also occurred because they do not have the same common vulnerabilities as centralized trading platforms in their infrastructure.

Decentralized exchanges outperform centralized exchanges in terms of trading volume, demonstrating a thousandfold growth in trading volumes in the last year alone. Interfaces for interacting with DeFi can be created by any programmer anywhere globally, and the essence of this interaction is the development of a financial ecosystem running on the global blockchain. By now, DeFi’s market capitalization has reached over $100 billion, and this trend will undoubtedly continue soon.

Speaking of examples, we can outline that even large companies like Deutsche Telekom have abandoned ​​private blockchains and are studying public infrastructure, supporting nodes in networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Algorand, Celo, etc. This fact suggests that the world of decentralized finance is gaining ground in the global market for clearing, custody and settlement services — just as Bitcoin had previously secured the status of a shielding asset, removing gold from its throne.

We observe that corporate demand accelerated when real rates on dollar deposits turned negative (central bank rate minus inflation). Inflationary expectations have intensified over the past year, fueling demand for long-term capital preservation. Today, Bitcoin is successfully winning the hearts and minds of not only speculators and hedge funds who, realizing the inevitability of the devaluation of dollar balances, vote with their money and transfer some of the treasury liquidity into digital assets.",17,2021-06-13 20:03:05,10

SOL,Bitcoin,Transferring tokens,"Since BTC was first launch on its own blockchain before every other tokens even existed, I am curious about how did they first transfer BTC tokens to other blockchains, like for instance ETH chain? If this could happen easily, then why can't we transfer tokens across chains today like let's say I want to transfer my tokens from ETH chain to Solana chain.",0,2021-08-20 04:36:40,6
SOL,Bitcoin,APY & APR," 

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

>Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

>What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.",13,2021-06-12 16:14:36,0

SOL,Bitcoin,"Don't Get Rekt in This Bull Run: Remember the 2017 ""Earn"" Scams?","
Just say this ad being promoted while scrolling on Reddit. Seriously?!? Again? 

With Bitcoin pumping like a 12-cylinder lambo on NOS, it's natural to get greedy. We've all been there, staring at that green dildo and thinking, ""There's gotta be a way to squeeze some extra sats out of this rocketing orange peel.""

But before you ape into the latest ""earn"" or ""lend"" platform promising double-digit APYs, remember the fate of your 2017 brethren who were seduced by similar sirens.

Celsius Network, anyone? They were promising 25% returns on BTC deposits, all the way up until they filed for bankruptcy last June, leaving thousands of hodlers with nothing but a big, fat, frozen middle finger. And let's not forget FTX, who were offering up to 8% on BTC lending. They, too, went tits up a few months later, taking a sizable chunk of their users' coins with them.

These weren't just some shady fly-by-night operations. These were seemingly reputable platforms that got hyped by big influencers and backed by even bigger VC money. Yet, when the market inevitably turned south, they crumbled like overleveraged sandcastles.

So, what's the lesson here?

Not your keys, not your coins.

If you're not the one holding the private keys, you don't really own your Bitcoin. You're just trusting some stranger with your financial future, and history shows that's a recipe for disaster.

Sure, the potential returns from these ""earn"" platforms might be tempting. But is it worth risking your entire stack on a promise that could vanish overnight? Remember, there's no such thing as free sats. If someone is offering you sky-high returns on your Bitcoin, they're probably doing something shady to make it happen.

So, please please please please x 21M, let's keep our wits about us in this bull run. Don't get blinded by greed and fall for the same scams that snagged so many in 2017. Remember, the safest place for your Bitcoin is always your own cold wallet.

Stay frosty, stack sats, and hodl on tight.",227,2024-01-29 13:18:14,93

SOL,Bitcoin,"Got scammed out of 85,000$ selling bitcoins recieving money via Neteller. Please advise on what I can do to stop this insanity.","So i was selling bitcoins on localbitcoins and a guy bought some bitcoins from me.

He first bought about 15 bitscoins in two trades via localbitcoins and then got a hold of me on skype and we just did more trades there with him sending first.

His Skype name is OncataBTC and he wanted to pay with Neteller saying his company had a merchant account. The company name was Seabrook Ltd. I checked out the homepage and they work with cryptcurrencies so things looked legit.

However the transaction was big so before selling to him the next time I contacted Neteller support and asked about his account to make sure it wasnt hacked or anything like that. I had heard stories about poker pros Skrill accounts being hacked and used to buy bitcoins whereafter the money was given back to the hacked account and the person selling the btc was SOL.


Neteller support told me they couldnt tell me anything about the other account because of privacy policies.

The buyer seemed legit enough. He had a merchant account that could send a lot of money via Neteller without any limit. 

The first transactions were through a company named Seabrook Ltd. 

He told me they wanted to buy more bitcoins and I sold some more a few days later.


However this time he paid with an account called Selborne Limited. I looked up this company too and asked him why this account was different, he replied some BS answer that Im sure I accepted. 

Around this time I made a big withdrawal of about 20k USD, however right after this withdrawal Neteller locked my account. This is a normal procedure and happens a lot to Neteller accounts with a lot of sudden traffic. My Neteller account had been inactive for years and now I was using it to sell bitcoins so I didnt think much of this at all, plus I was also making a big withdrawal so I figured this was just standard procedure and didnt think much of it.


I started using my 2nd Neteller 

Third time he contacted me to buy he wanted even more bitcoins. I sold him some more at around 1100$ each, but he 'accidently' sent me 2000$ more than we agreed on. 

He admited to the mistake but said I could just send him bitcoins for them. 

Also this time he sent me money from a Neteller account named Bet 365. 

This raised my suspicions and I immediately thought something fishy was going on.

I told him I Couldnt go thru with the 4th trade (he wanted like 50 coins) as I was super suspicious.

Either way he stopped contacting me for coins and Neteller wouldnt give me any info about my account being disabled other than they were investigating it.


A couple of weeks went by, and finally Neteller sent me this email:

*Dear Mr. Amarre,
 
Your NETELLER account has been enabled. We apologize for the inconvenience that may have been caused to you while your account was disabled, and thank you for your patience and cooperation during that time. A reversal has been completed on a recent transfer to your account. We apologize for this unfortunate incident, however the transfer was unauthorized and had to be returned to its origin.
 
Once again, your patience in this matter has been greatly appreciated.
 
Kind regards,*

I logged onto my accounts thinking hopefuly just a little bit was taken but logged on and to my horror 85k USD were missing.

I contacted them again and said something along the lines of 'WTF?? + some other stuff' about how they were downplaying that I had lost 85k USD from my account.

Now Im waiting for them to call me and explain to me what the hell they are doing.

I think going to a lawyer would be a good idea as well as the media. 

I can see headlines like 'Hobbyist gets scammed for 85k USD and Neteller does nothing'

Tell me Reddit, 

WHAT can I do? :-/

-----------------------------------------------------------  




Update 1: A friend gave me a different email at Neteller that I could message to talk about this issue. This is the reply that I got;

Dear Alex,

We have escalated this issue on your behalf to the appropriate department.  Once the issue has been looked into, you will be contacted by email.

SOL,Bitcoin,FUD in the news = Frustration,"So I recently typed ""bitcoin"" into a search engine and most of the top stories are FUD from major publications. Conversely, most of the positive messages are coming from Coindesk, Cointelegraph, and bitcoinmagazine. Many of these 'news' outlets I used to trust but now I'm really starting to feel frustrated with them for not fully understanding how Bitcoin adoption can help drive green renewable energy or that its a more stable form of money than fiat, or that despite the stock market tanking it has been relatively stable...

Does anyone else feel frustrated that the major mainstream narrative right now is driving a message that a) doesn't separate bitcoin from ""crypto"", b) labels mining as wasteful and bad for the environment, or c) that they are turning people who don't know squat about the real problems in society away from solutions?

Or are you all just sitting back and thinking its business as usual, 'news' isn't anything more than brainwashing for the masses, we're still early and stack sats before the price gets driven up by more competition?",21,2022-10-02 05:16:10,14

SOL,Bitcoin,[Serious] Need help to recover potentially thousands of bitcoin,"Hi all,

I won't give too many details for obvious reasons. I have in my possession an encrypted hard drive from a relative which has been untouched since 2013. This person invited me to buy some bitcoin in 2011, invested at least 1000€ in bitcoin (possiblity more) and was setting up a business related to bitcoin back in 2013. He then passed away and we now have his hard drives but they're all encrypted. He was very security savvy (his passwords were in his head with a minimum of 25 characters sometimes) so brute forcing is not an option. We asked some very knowledgeable people who said we should give up for the time being because current CPU power would not be able to crack anything in the next coming years (we even talked to companies which only purpose is to have high end CPUs). There is nothing written from his belongings that would point in the direction of a password, but he had a purple usb key which was also a fingerprint reader so I'm guessing he used it for 2FA.

Knowing him very well, he was extremely obsessed with security (he had a dedicated router working as a firewall on top of his router modem at home), so I would expect the worse in this case. The hard drive was an internal hybrid disc from a Sony Vaio.

Did anyone else go through a similar situation? Any creative ideas? Or are we SOL? I was just listening to the reply all podcast and they were talking about a bitcoin hunter so I just thought of asking here for ideas. Thanks",15,2020-09-08 16:29:34,36

Ledger has closed source software ..and trezor has its own problems like very limited coin support ..does not support major coins like ada,dot,sol etc

One risk I can imagine with usb wallet is ...when you use the private key to sing the transaction - I guess its exposed to internet vs in hardware wallet it does not leave the wallet ...correct?

But am concerned ledger has closed source software ...which can be changed my developers of ledger any time which makes them risky? don't know much how it works.",9,2021-11-07 19:34:04,22

SOL,Bitcoin,Stolen BTC,"SOS: I got scammed and they stole my BTC. How can I get my assets back? PLEASE help me if you can. I’m losing my mind. 
Details: I accidentally went to a fake Coinbase Pro website and after a log in attempt a message appeared saying “your account has been disabled due to suspicious activities. call # for assistance.” Since I was already having trouble  the idea of scammers didn’t even cross my mind and called. This guy with heavy Indian accent answered and said they need to “link” Coinbase with Coinbase Pro. I said that doesn’t make sense since I’ve made transfers between them before but he said this is a new process and everyone must do it. He then told me to go to this other website where he got remote access to my computer.. Then from Coinbase Pro he sent my BTC to my Coinbase BTC wallet. I complained about his moves multiple times but he kept threatening me saying there are suspicious activities and if you don’t comply we will permanently suspend your account by the state law and you will lose your assets. I got scared and accepted. By the end of convo he wanted to “link” my Binance account to Coinbase too but he said something stupid that made me sure he is a scammer and I disconnected the remote access but idk how they had already initiated sending the BTC to an external Wallet address that I don’t know who it belongs to BUT HAVE THE DETAILS OF THE TRANSACTION INCLUDING THEIR WALLET ADDRESS, HASH ETC. Now I’m really stressed out and need help. Also, I reported the full incident in writing with full details to the Police and a report was made. I have pressed charges too. Note: I know I was overly stupid. That’s why I have not been eating or sleeping for the last 2 days. I am suffering very much already and constant panic attacks are killing me. That said, if you cannot help or don’t know any solutions please don’t make comments that make me feel even worse.

SOL,Bitcoin,"Why are old Bitcoin clients not forwad compatible, even with the script language? (Please help a non-techie.)","As a non-techie, I am trying to understand the forward compatibility of Bitcoin.

Satoshi said this after releasing the first version.

>The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.  Because of that, I wanted to design it to support every possible transaction type I could think of.  The problem was, each thing required special support code and data fields whether it was used or not, and only covered one special case at a time.  It would have been an explosion of special cases.  The solution was script, which generalizes the problem so transacting parties can describe their transaction as a predicate that the node network evaluates.

My understanding is that Satoshi introduced script so that a wide variety of transaction types can be supported.

Ane he said this in the same post.

>""Currently, receivers only accept two templates: direct payment and bitcoin address.  Future versions can add templates for more transaction types and nodes running that version or higher will be able to receive them.  All versions of nodes in the network can verify and process any new transactions into blocks, even though they may not know how to read them.""

It looks like he wanted forward compatibility. And he seems to have thought the older clients would be able to understand newer types of transactions, because they are all written in script which the older versions can understand.

My questions.

1. Is my understanding correct that Satoshi expected Bitcoin to be forward compatible thanks to script? (My reference of forward compatibility is this. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/43j03j/comment/czis8ru/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/43j03j/comment/czis8ru/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
2. But the reality seems that old Bitcoin clients don't really understand new transaction types and just pass them. Why is this so, even with script? Are new opcodes introduced in the script that cannot be understood by old clients?
3. In the first quote from Satoshi above, what did he mean by ""Future versions can add templates for more transaction types""? Does he mean that future versions will have more opcodes, with which you can introduce more transaction types? Or all the opcodes were there already, but new combinations of them, i.e. templates, will be introduced?

SOL,Bitcoin,About the guy that lost 15 BTC the other day.,"One thing I've always wondered about is what happens when you lose your bitcoin address or something like that.  The way it sounds from that unfortunate fellow is those 15 BTC are gone forever. That is thousands of dollars worth of BTC just floating in the abyss somewhere.  

I don't know a whole lot about bitcoin but I've always been curious and interested about it.  Aren't there supposed to be only a total of 21 million BTC ever?  What happens when those all get lost just like this one guys 15 were lost?  I understand that it would take a really long time for 21 million to get lost like this guys but I would imagine this losing of the bitcoins happens, not often it happens doesn't it?  It would lead to reason that eventually all 21 million could be lost to the void. 


What happens then?  One major hurdle I feel like bitcoin is gonna have to jump is insurance.  When my credit card gets lost or stolen I call the bank, cancel the card, and am not responsible for any fraudulent charges.  But with bitcoin, what happens when i lose my bitcoin address?  Am I just SOL like that guy that lost his 15 BTC?  Was that guy just a special case?  Would other bitcoin websites actually be able to help when you contact them saying you don't have an address the some amount of BTC?

Obviously I am pretty ignorant to how exactly bitcoin and bitcoin exchanges work but I am curious.  It is cases such as the one with that guy that make me not want to go anywhere near bitcoin.  To think I could potentially just lose my money so easily is no good.

Among the companies targeted by U.S. sanctions is BitRiver, which was founded in 2017, and as the name implies, operates its mining farms with hydroelectric power. The mining firm employs over 200 full-time staff in three offices across Russia.

“These US actions should obviously be viewed as interference in the crypto mining industry, unfair competition and an attempt to change the global balance of power in favor of American companies,” said BitRiver founder and CEO Igor Runets, adding that the company “has never provided services to Russian government institutions and has not worked with customers already targeted by Washington’s sanctions.”",4,2022-04-22 01:13:32,7
SOL,Bitcoin,Estimated minimum needed margin for borrowing USD against BTC when reaction time for increasing collateral is 24hrs,"Hello dear Hodlers,

I thought about bridging some of my BTC to a smart chain and borrow against it for quite some time now and I did it to some degree. I have more BTC, but I do not want to transfere more than necessary due to a healthy mistrust in smart contracts and increased risk coming with it naturally I think. So I have some trouble defining my personal margin in % measured in BTC/USD.

Lets assume I transfere BTC and borrow 50% against it, so lets say I transfere 100$ in BTC and borrow 50$ in USD. My margin would 49% of BTC vs USD before I get liquidated. Lets assume I want to reduce my margin to an amount that is of course riskier of getting liquidated, but since I can always pump more BTC it is not ""that"" risky but rather a question of how fast my reaction time is.

Since I am somewhat a degen I check prices at least once a day of BTC/USD. So lets assume my reaction time is 24hrs of reacting to a price drop and transfering more BTC to increase my margin again. I can only see daily candles and I cannot find the maximum drop over 24hrs via the GUIs and Tools I have available, which I need to optimize my margin range. So for defining my margin I need to measure the risk first for my personal scenario.

So here is my question: What is the maximum amount of BTC/USD in % BTC dropped within 24hrs ever since BTC exisits? How do you define your margin call level for you personal? I heard 80% is defined as very safe?

EDIT: It would be nice if you could add the date and timeframe for the drop of BTC if you answer the first question just for varification reasons.",0,2022-04-20 04:07:09,7

SOL,Bitcoin,I have become a victim of an eBay / PayPal Bitcoin charge back scam.,"I'm trying to work with ebay, paypal, and I would like for the police to get involved as well. I am being scammed out of approximately $2000.00 worth of bitcoins that I sold on ebay over the last several weeks. There are two users who have filed PayPal chargebacks against me.

 

The users are: fiedlerhm3224 and auscooter12.

 

I believe this is a very sophisticated scam since both of these users have been ebay members for many years and have many positive feedbacks. So I believe what has happened is a perpetrator has stolen and taken over these userids and has orchestrated the scam, gaining my trust, sending me money for which I sent the bitcoins, and then, once the real owner found out (perhaps they got a call from the credit card company?) at that point the real user activated a charge back. Either that, or these two users really are the scam artists themselves, which I find unlikely. I was able to trace the IP number of one of them who claims to be living in VA to a CA location, to a server that has been marked as a potential ""botnet"" threat. This is why I think this was a highly sophisticated attack and that ebay/paypal/law enforcement should investigate it thoroughly.

 

I am ready to cooperate fully and have all the records of the bitcoin transactions, as well as email communications that I have had with these two scammer buyers

 

The most disgusting thing is these scammers had left me a string of positive feedbacks, only to stick the knife in, in the end! Look at this:

I'm absolutely furious over this and want to persue this to the end. This sort of behavior does nothing for the ebay community or for any community for that matter.

 

If anyone has any advice for me I would be very interested in hearing from you.

I will append a couple of details here for everyone to see and learn from my mistakes as I continue to persue alternate routes/ways of recovering the funds.

SOL,Bitcoin,"In January I started Project Bitcoin - a social experiment to turn a coin into a house making only bitcoin transactions. I've made 9 transactions with Casascius and others around the world. It's been a wild ride, and I am excited to share an update with the community that's taken the ride with me.","Here's the website for Project Bitcoin: http://www.projectbitcoin.com. 

Overview of the Project: I started with a coin and I am making only international transactions with bitcoin until, hopefully, I arrive at a house. The purpose, in addition to the social experiment, is to showcase our global bitcoin community, and to tell a (hopefully positive) story about bitcoin and the bitcoin community.

My transactions - which have traversed Peru, the US, Brazil, England, Austria, and now France: 

1. for 17 mBTC I found a Peruvian metal worker to engrave one side of a central bank issued Peruvian Sol to Jonathan in England for .1 bitcoin. 
2. For 150 mBTC, I purchased 4 hand crafted leather wallets with the bitcoin logo from Phinnaeus Gate and sold them to Eduardo in Brazil. 
3. For 273 mBTC, I  purchased two .1btc Casascius coins from Casascius and sold them to Daniel in Austria.  
4. For 1 BTC, I purchased a statue that blew up from Michael: http://www.projectbitcoin.com/1/post/2014/03/the-statue-blew-up-oh-well.html
5. For 1 BTC, I purchased the Last (Bitcoin) Supper painting from Youl. http://www.projectbitcoin.com/1/post/2014/03/last-bitcoin-supper.html

Quick Summary: The project began January 10th. For 6 weeks, things moved FAST. The Gox debacle and declining price of bitcoin have seemed to really shake things up. The Last (Bitcoin) Supper painting is, I believe, a crazy genius commentary on bitcoin... and there is nothing in the world like it. But it hasn't yet received any real offers. 

When I started Project Bitcoin in January, I understood that this would be a wild ride - and I signed up for that ride... rain or shine. It hasn't disappointed. I've gotten to meet AMAZING people in the bitcoin community, people who've kept up my belief in the kind of transformation bitcoin and the surrounding community can make in the world.

I've learned a lot since the Project Bitcoin began in January, and I am happy to answer any questions. I am also hoping that people don't kneejerk downvote before they get to know me and the project. This has been a labor of love, and the best way I've known to make a contribution to our community! ",40,2014-03-30 16:31:26,31

SOL,Bitcoin,An analysis of BTC fundamentals,"***Disclaimer:*** *This post is not an endorsement to either buy or sell Bitcoins. I am simply attempting to outline the reasons why there is inherent value in Bitcoins, as well as the risks that come with investing in a crypto-currency. In full disclosure, I personally own and use them, but only a very small portion of my overall portfolio which I would be ok if BTC went to 0 tomorrow.*

**Purpose:** I’ve been seeing a lot of doom and gloom (as well as irrational exuberance) in a lot of posts lately, and a lot of people saying this or that with no evidence or fundamentals to back up their claims. So I wanted to put my thoughts and experiences [more about me below] out there in the hopes that people actually serious about utilizing Bitcoins (BTC from here on) might find this information helpful, as well as to connect with and solicit thoughts from anybody else that’s done research on the future of BTC. Also **mods:** I searched through old posts and the FAQ but couldn’t really find anything like this, so let me know if there is a more appropriate place to post this. I can also add hyperlinked sources to this to make it a reference document if there is interest.

**Summary/tl;dr:** The fundamentals underlying the intrinsic value of Bitcoins haven’t changed. In fact, they continue to improve day-by-day, as merchant and user adoption increases. As long as this trend continues, and certain risk factors - see below - are minimized, BTC will eventually become widely accepted as a currency.

***That being said***, you should never “invest” more money than you are willing to completely lose, or money that you would otherwise need for living expenses. Otherwise, you are gambling. (I put “invest” in quotes because I believe BTC are currently far too speculative to be considered an “investment.” This may change in the future, but the technology is still so new, and there are so many unknowns, that it should not be considered anything more than a speculative investment at this point.)

**This has happened before and it will happen again:** This week hasn’t been good for those holding Bitcoins. In fact, if you invested in BTC anytime in the past year, I’d say it’s been a pretty shitty year, period. But the thing is, we’ve seen this type of thing in financial markets before, almost exactly to a t, and how they tend to play out. There have been various bubbles of all shapes and sizes throughout history, and the run-up in prices earlier this year, was no exception. However, unlike the critics, I believe BTCs are different, as there is significant intrinsic value in the BTC network and BTC as a value store - which I outline below.

I also think it’s useless to speculate about the direction of BTC in the short to medium-term (I would argue the price adjustment has been a good thing for the long-term), so to me the only meaningful way to analyze what’s going on is to examine the fundamentals (apologies if a lot of this is basic, but I wanted to cover all the key points as I saw them):



### Value:

* ***Currency As a Store of Value:*** A currency has value because the holders of it believe it has value. This might seem like a paradox, but it is how fiat currencies (namely, the USD and every other major currency in the world) function, and BTC is no different. As the number of people owning and using BTC increases, the relative value of BTC will have to grow as the supply is limited to 21million BTC (to use an economics analogy: In this case, we can’t find more seashells, we can only break the ones we have into smaller pieces).

    ***What if user adoption were to plateau or decrease?*** Even if growth were to stop today, and not a single more person in the world were to use BTC than already are, there would still be value assigned to them by those who currently hold, which is reflected in the BTC/USD rate. There is already value there by virtue of the number of people that own it and merchants that accept it.

    As of me writing this, there are an estimated 1.2million BTC holders on ledgers worldwide. This number is greater than the population of many countries that have their own currency. I believe BTC are past the point where people should question the viability of BTC as a store of value, and instead look at BTC for the value it provides for the following reasons.

* ***Worldwide Transaction Network:*** In my analysis, this represents the true potential value of BTC. Think of the major credit card companies (Visa, MasterCard, AMEX) - they’re accepted pretty much anywhere right? You can walk into almost any shop throughout the world, and as long as you hold one of these cards, the merchant will trade you his/her goods and services for a portion of what you’ve got in your account. And this is **hugely** valuable. To the tune of $Billions per year these companies make in profit, all because of the network of merchants that accept them worldwide. But one thing that people might forget is these companies had to grow their merchant network, just like BTC, one at a time.

    Thus, this to me represents the primary growth potential of BTC. I’ve seen estimates that 10,000 retailers are currently accepting them, and there are some pretty big names in the list (Overstock, Target, eBay via PayPal, CVS). As the number of places that accept BTC increase, so does the intrinsic value. This also has a compounding, even self-fulfilling, effect: as the number of places that accept BTC increases, the value increases, thus more merchants are willing to accept BTC as a currency because it has value…chew on that for a second.

* ***Growing BTC Eco-system:*** This is represented by the growing number of Bitcoin-related venture startups and websites/wallets/apps that support BTC transactions. There is a network effect here, and as long as people are invested into it, will continue to grow.

* ***Security/Anonymity/Ease of Transaction:*** I think most of us are familiar with BTC security measures (how important the password to your wallet/account is), how the hashes are generated by an algorithm that cannot be faked (essentially counterfeit-proof), and low transaction costs. These are all pluses that make the currency attractive as a value store, with some caveats listed in the “Risks” section below.

* ***Hedge Against Fiat Currencies:*** This is a two-edged sword. I think there’s a lot of investment in BTC because of the fear of overactive Central Banks inflating other currencies (again, namely the USD), but as we saw this week, this can work against BTC. I explain more later below. 

So I’ve briefly outlined above some pretty clear reasons why there is inherent value in BTC, and the reasons why I personally am optimistic about the long-term future and will continue to use them. That being said, I’ve also identified **several primary risk factors** that ***worry*** me as a long-term investor, ones that all holders of BTC should be aware of. Please, if you know or can think of any others, reply or PM me so I can add them to this list:



### Risks:

* ***Continued market volatility:*** Price volatility might be good for day-traders, but for a currency, it’s killer. As described above, one of the core elements a currency must have is as a store of value, and if the price fluctuates wildly from day-to-day, merchants (and currency owners) will be less willing to accept it. Who would want to hold currency that’s worth 1/2 of what it was last week? 

    This is also a reason why it’s essential for the currency to have a limited supply (or perception thereof), or else rampant inflation would occur - look at Zimbabwe. The bottom-line is, if the USD (US Dollar) were to drop 25% in one week, like we saw with BTC this week, it would indicate a complete economic collapse was occurring. Faith in the currency would be destroyed, and it would take extreme measures to preserve it. It’s actually kind of a small miracle BTC hasn’t completely collapsed, but I think it’s because (1) there is real value in it, and (2) BTC are not widely used yet.

    The remedy for this is there has to be either (1) a large holder of the currency that is able to inject or take out some currency to keep the price stable -- if you look at the US Federal Reserve this is one of its two primary mandates, or (2) the number of BTC owners has to reach a saturation “tipping point” where enough people are utilizing the currency for day-to-day transactions, and not for speculative reasons. I don’t believe we’re quite at this point yet, but getting there.

* ***Governmental regulation:*** This is a big unknown for me, and with recent news that Russia and China have prohibited use of BTCs, presumably in the effort to curb illegal transactions, could become a trend. However, to address people who are concerned about this, I would make the following points:
    1. What is the reason for government regulation? Is it to curb illegal activity transacted in BTC? If this is the case, there is plenty of illegal activity being transacted in US Dollars, Russian Rubles, gold coins, jewelry, etc… What makes BTC special? If the reason is to prohibit a competing national currency, then that is a separate legal issue which will have to be resolved, but probably not until far in the future. In the US, a case like this would almost definitely go to the Supreme Court for clarification.
    2. Which government agency should have regulatory authority? In more democratic societies (than Russia and China) that have a strong rule of law (most of the rest of the western world), government agencies can’t simply do something because they want to (unfortunately the trend is changing even in the US). There has to be a legal jurisdiction or precedence that would allow this, and because crypto-currencies are so new, none has been set. For example, just look at how long it took most state governments to start taxing Amazon purchases. I used to live in Virginia, and they just started in Dec 2013, almost 20 years after Amazon was founded…
    3. How would governments enforce restrictions? Would it be by imposing fines on merchants that accept the crypto-currencies? Legally, how is this different than restricting payment in gold or silver then, or Craigslist transactions?
 
* ***Ease of use:*** BTC are not quite easy enough to use where the average person will find it appealing. I think a lot of companies are working to address this (e.g. the hardest part of signing up on Coinbase was remembering my password), so to me this risk is what we can do the most about, but still a concern.

* ***Loss potential:*** If you forget or lose your password, you’re SOL at this point. But this isn’t really different from losing cash on the street.

* ***Market Cornering(added):*** There is the possibility a large percentage of the total available BTC are owned by a handful of individuals. For example, it is estimated that [Satoshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) alone owns ~1 million BTC. In the event that one or more of these owners were to attempt to [corner the BTC market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornering_the_market) there could be extreme price volatility.

* ***Current overall valuation may be a bit high:*** Back of the napkin calculation follows-    
    Total valuation of BTC = (# of BTC available) x (current price/BTC)    
    Total valuation of BTC = ~13million x $330 = ~$4billion    
$4 billion of perceived value is probably high for as small as the BTC network currently is. But, this number is reflective of the high growth rate in the number of users/owners and merchants that have accepted BTC. In other words, this may be a fair price. And, by definition, it is technically the actual fair price since it is, after all, an actual currency.

I could go on, but those are the major value and risk factors I see. If you have anything to add, please feel free.


**So, in the context of everything I said above, I’d like to talk about what happened this week in particular:** 

I believe this week’s price movement (as of me writing this, has been a 25% drop) is a result of several factors:

1. [News that US Dollar is very strong](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-29445335)
2. Capitulation: I don’t have the ability to do Technical Analysis on BTC right now, but just eyeing the [1-year chart](http://www.coindesk.com/price/#2013-10-04,2014-10-04,close,bpi,USD), it looks like $400 was a key support point for the price of BTC. Once it broke through that, psychological barriers were broken and selling cascaded.
3. [Russia](http://www.coindesk.com/russia-proposes-fines-bitcoin/) and China potentially banning BTC

And that’s it. That’s all I can find about Bitcoins in the news. The value fundamentals I listed have not changed one bit, and if anything, the rate of user adoption has increased as more people are [learning](http://avc.com/2014/09/video-of-the-week-fred-ehrsams-bitcoin-presentation/)
 [what](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238103)
 [it is](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11138581/Bitcoin-will-become-the-new-gold.html).

Which is why I’m excited about the future of BTC. It’s a product that I use and like, and see tremendous value for. This week’s sell-off just means I can buy more.


**About me:** 

In a past life, I was an equity research analyst responsible for due diligence, fundamental/technical analysis, and making recommendations to the PM on which stocks a certain mutual fund should buy or sell. This meant reading through a **lot** of annual reports, financial statements, 10-K, 10-Q, shareholder calls, etc… My primary influences were Warren Buffett, Philip Fisher, and Ben Graham. If you recognize these names, you’ll probably guess that I was a value investor^1 , and you’d be right. 
The fundamental premise behind value investing, for those that don’t know, is that you can find companies that are trading at a discount to their “true” intrinsic value, and thus can make money by buying the stock at a low price and selling when the market has realized the fair value of the company and the price has subsequently gone up. This is essentially how Warren Buffett built Berkshire Hathaway and became the world’s richest man (for a short period); his strategy has since greatly evolved, but this was the core philosophy he used for a long time.


^1 Utilizing this strategy, our fund bought a significant stake in AAPL when the price per share was less than the amount of **cash** per share the company currently held (split adjusted something like ~$2 per share when we bought). It hasn’t all been a bed of roses, we’ve made some not-so-great investments, but that’s a story for a different time :)

SOL,Bitcoin,My opinion on cryptocurrency.,"Everyone is very pessimistic about everything in the crypto market at the moment. I think that the contraction in disposable income due to inflation is part of the reason why the market is behaving the way it is right now. Retail investors and the amount of money they can put into the market has decreased. The year-over-year rate of change in the Fed's balance sheet is also a factor, but the risk from this factor didn't manifest itself in the last market cycle. The main reason, I think, is that many institutions need to close out their positions and rebalance their portfolios at the end of the year - after all, they have had a very good year of taking on a high level of risk. And of course they have to make tax provision. But my view is that the fundamentals of the industry have not changed. The last round of bears and bulls caused 'trauma' for many people, leading to the conviction that the end of this year is when the BTC halving cycle will reach its peak. This 'trauma' has caused many to become overly cautious in the face of this cycle. But clearly, we are going through an extended market cycle. So far, we still haven't seen record-breaking high levels of market participation. There has been a fairly large speculative boom in the NFT market, but the participants are still mainly those who already have a lot of ETH and can afford to splurge. Large-scale funds will allocate new, mandatory portfolio space to the crypto market in the first quarter of next year. If this drives prices up significantly, it will lead to even larger market participation: record-breaking new wallet addresses, long-time holders moving assets to deals in large numbers, and so on. Keep in mind that digital assets as a whole haven't changed much since May, unless you were extremely lucky to catch the second half of the year on the rebound. The market's rally from the July lows still hasn't allowed most digital assets to make new highs. But the really meaningful and impactful popularity of big institutions is already starting to happen, along with the exponentially growing new usage scenarios that accompany the crypto market. In addition, artists, musicians and big brands are starting to realize the importance of Web 3.0. There are speculators among them, but most of them are serious. We've reached a critical market tipping point. I think the market will start to accelerate towards the end of this month and continue until the middle of next year, when it will really bubble up ...... This is what is currently happening. Please sit tight and fasten your seat belts, cut back on overly speculative assets and move them to higher quality. Don't blindly chase the highs either, by the time you do, it will be too late. And, unless you're an expert... (I'm not), add some more small premiums to your options if you're going to use leverage. High quality Layer 1s like BTC, ETH, Luna, AVAX and SOL can be better core assets. Most NFTs are overly speculative, but also rapidly iterating, so you can hold a little. Most importantly, if you're in it for the long haul like I am, don't let short-term volatility affect you too much. If that's where your stress comes from with these short-term fluctuations and start tweeting for answers, it means you've invested too much to the point where it's affecting your life. There's more to come, and just because BTC is flat after a 50% drop doesn't make it any less fair. While we don't know how the market will perform in the short term, we do know which direction it will most likely go in the long term. Putting in the long term means tweaking your portfolio, looking at the charts for fun, and never caring until speculation is rampant (at which point you can liquidate 50% or more and make a stablecoin gain). The next phase of the market is the shift from retail to big institutions. The whole of 2021 is building the foundation for this, and 2022 is when these 'big players' will really arrive.",2,2021-12-15 15:53:05,2

SOL,Bitcoin,"I wrote an algorithm to buy cryptocurrency based on what coins Reddit talks about positively and I've been running it for 3 weeks, here are the results","Reddit feels positively about Bitcoin? Let’s buy some. Reddit likes ALGO today – great let’s get some of that as well. 

I built an algorithm to do just that, you can see a detailed guide on how to set up your own reddit sentiment crypto trading bot [here](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/07/10/coding-a-crypto-trading-algorithm-that-analyses-reddit-sentiment/) and I have been testing it for about three weeks now.

Today it’s time to look at the overall performance, as well as how the bot logic has worked in general.

During this testing period the bot has accumulated 20 out of the top 40 coins by Marketcap: BTC, ETH, ALGO, XLM, ADA, SOL, LINK, DOGE, MATIC, XTZ, LTC, VET, DAI, CAKE, DOT, EOS, AAVE, XMR, MKR, ATOM.

The parameters I gave my crypto trading bot is to only look for keywords from the top 40 coins by marketcap, in order to stop it from buying into scams or other suspicious projects. Within 3 weeks the bot has invested in half of the top 40 coins.

Looking at some of the coins that weren’t picked up by our bot tends to reveal an interesting conclusion: USDT, BUSD, BNB, USDC, UNI, Crypto.com, SHIBA. Although these are in top 40, Reddit didn’t bother talking about them, or not positively at any rate.

What these coins have in common is that most of them are transactional tokens, stablecoins, or downright useless coins (looking at you SHIBA). As a Redditor myself, I’m quite proud of the result generated by the hivemind, yes DOGE is there but it doesn’t matter. Most coins picked by the trading bot with help of the Reddit sentiment are coins that I would invest into myself. 

For now the return on our investment doesn’t look so great. But then again, no accumulation strategy will perform well in a downtrend so this is not representative of the overall result. The outcome is relatively predictable, if the market is up, we’re up as we’re buying the actual asset and not using CFDs or futures trading.

Overall I’m on 15% loss, but as the entire market is down, this is not indicative of the performance. The data that does get me excited is the quality of the coins bought, which means that if nothing else, this could be an automated buy and hold diversification strategy.

See how you can set this up yourself to use in test mode or live mode (at your own risk).

SOL,Bitcoin,I need some inspiration to finish an improbable bitcoin journey started six years ago.,"Six years ago, I had an idea that I decided to call ""Project Bitcoin"": I wanted to turn a Peruvian Sol coin (worth about 30 cents) into a house through a series of international transactions using bitcoin. [kind of like the paper clip guy but showcasing the power of bitcoin] 

I hoped to shine a light on the power of bitcoin to change lives and support increasingly large decentralized, global transactions. And a house would be cool too!

It worked... and fast. In 9 transactions I turned that coin into 3.1 bitcoin. You can read about it on the website I set up 6 years ago: projectbitcoin.com.

Then life got in the way. Or maybe I wasn't creative enough. Or maybe I saw myself seeing some success and got scared - as I've often done. 

Whatever the reason: I stopped. For six years. 

Now, because of the sheer momentum of bitcoin - and none of my own - I am closer to that house than I deserve to be, or than I ever thought possible. 

And I'm realizing, as the most painful year in many of our lives comes to an end, that I have a chance to add a bit of light, experience a bit of light, and see this crazy project through to completion. 

I just don't know how. 

I would love some ideas, inspiration, motivation to help me get this across the finish line. 

What can I sell? What can I buy? How can I make Project Bitcoin really, really special. 

Thank you!

SOL,Bitcoin,CampBX Stole My Bitcoins,"I've been trading BTC off and on for the past two years. I used CampBX because I saw someone recommend it back in the day and being based in the US somehow made it feel less shady to me than the foreign alternatives. I've had a relatively good experience trading there but last month I decided to move my trading to an exchange with better volume.
So I log in (with 2FA) and click the “Move Bitcoins” link and I'm greeted with the following text:
>This account is under review and your outbound Bitcoin transfers have been temporarily disabled.
>Bitcoins Locked.

I submit a help desk ticket and get the following response:
>Dear not_happy_camper,
>Your CampBX account is under review by our Compliance and Security department as we were unable to see any activity in your CampBX >account from past several months.
>We will work with the concerned department to complete this review ASAP. One of our team will get back to you shortly with an update.
>
>Thank you,
>CampBX Support

I reply asking them to please explain the situation and remedy this ASAP. But they only respond with the same canned message again and again. I decided to give them one month to “unlock” my bitcoins before going public. They have not. I logged in today and noticed they have deleted all of my transaction history.
Anyone have any ideas on a course of action I can take? I get the feeling I'm SOL.

tl;dr: CampBX won't let me move my Bitcoins out of their exchange and deleted my transaction history.",52,2015-03-17 01:51:52,22
SOL,Bitcoin,Crypto\com App - Wishdraw minimum?," 

Sorry if this is a totally noob post...

I wanted to learn about bitcoin so did the obligatory reading up, and created various accounts, one was with crypto.com. I figured the best way to learn was messing around with small amounts, so bought some ADA and SOL. I thought I'd continue the learning process by transferring an amount from Crypto\\com to my Exodus wallet, but the Cyprpto app is saying there's a minimum amount, which I don't have, having only invested £80 as a playing around fund.

Slightly confused now as I appear to be unable to transfer my balance to my wallet, or even to my bank. I assume I'm missing something.....",2,2021-06-09 11:41:18,2
SOL,Bitcoin,Bitcoin sent from Cashapp to Bitmart deposit wallet- been stuck for over two weeks,"Hey guys, looking for some guidance as my transaction has been stuck in limbo for over two weeks. Recently, I made 3 separate transactions, 2 of which were successful. All 3 transactions were Bitcoin purchases on cashapp, then withdrawals to a Bitcoin wallet on Bitmart exchange. The series went as follows:

Transaction #1: $100 received in Bitmart within 2 hours

Transaction #2: $250 not received

Transaction #3: $100 received in Bitmart within 1 hour.

The $250 transaction has been confirmed on the blockchain for weeks now, via a cashapp web receipt. Bitmart's customer service, which is literally useless, has confirmed via the TXID that they see the transaction; no errors have been made on my end.

So my question is, now what? It's been over two weeks, the transaction was completed correctly, and my money is nowhere to be found. Should i expect this to reach the wallet eventually? Is there a tool to reverse the transaction? Or am I SOL?

Any feedback is helpful. Thanks.",6,2021-05-06 21:51:20,2
SOL,Bitcoin,Accidentally sending BCH to a BTC wallet,"I didn’t think this could happen but I only use BTC. I posted a few min ago reaching out for help because a customer of mine sent me funds that took a long while to get. This is her first ever transfer using crypto so she’s brand spanking new. She sent me her screenshot of the transfer complete on her end and turns out she purchased BCH instead of BTC and sent to to the address I provided. I always use a legacy address, no real reasoning behind why I chose to send my legacy wallet info except for the other wallet addresses aren’t always compatible, the sender will say it won’t send or no such address so I’ve been receiving with a legacy address. I’m not a seasoned crypto guy by any means, I’m still learning myself, I’m not quite sure of the difference between a legacy route and default or compatible route. With that said, I was able to spend a little time on google and retrieve the transaction myself so if I can do it, anyone can! 
Customer: used coinbase to buy and send bitcoin cash
Me: provided my legacy address from Coinami

Here’s the link of the steps I took provided by coinami, it was super super easy. I did it all from my phone, no computer/laptop. Took all of 5 min, took more time to write down and type in my recovery phrase than getting the bitcoin cash into my BCH wallet. I went ahead and created anBCH wallet as soon as I noticed she sent cash and not coins. 

Good luck and I hope I was able to help someone out! Coinbase told her she was basically SOL so they aren’t any help.

SOL,Bitcoin,Future generations & Bitcoin security,"I am relatively new to Bitcoin.  have been researching and have couple of questions/ concerns about it down the line.  
1)  How will the security work?  If it’s adopted by all I picture a bunch of horror stories about people losing all of their Bitcoin because they didn’t use an external wallet properly or it got physically stolen- it’s not the easiest thing to grasp how to keep your Bitcoin safe.  I imagine that this will happen to many people and will scare others to use.  I understand a big pro of Bitcoin is that it’s decentralized, but now you’re relying on everyone to store and exchange exactly the right way, and you’re basically SOL if you lose it since nobody’s managing it.  
2)  If Bitcoin is the currency for the future, what happens to the future generations who’s grandparents didn’t buy Bitcoin because they didn’t know/ weren’t aware about it?  If Bitcoin replaces fiat one day, how will it be fair for the future generations who’s grandparents didn’t buy any Bitcoin- they are just poor now while everyone who bought back in the day is rich?

SOL,Bitcoin,Casual Hodl Needs Plain English on X2 Fork,"Good day everyone.

Being relatively new to crypto currency, and originally just planning on using bitcoin as an alternate investment option, I have some questions about the segwitX2 fork. Honestly, I'm not super concerned on what happens in November, I just want some information.

Let's say I have my bitcoin in an exchange (Coinmama, Coinbase, etc.) at the time the fork happens. Does this mean I get an equivalent amount of X2 added to my account? I'm guessing that it would depend on the exchange and their policies. Probably just SOL in most places, right?

On the flip side, lets say I had my bitcoin in a hardware wallet when the fork happens. Would I have the X2 bitcoin suddenly in my wallet? Do I have to register somewhere first?

I'm well aware that these questions could just be stupid and I have a fundamental misunderstanding of how forks work. The reason I ask is that I heard when BCH (Bitcoin Cash) was forked, some owners had their accounts/wallets credited with BCH while still having their bitcoin. If anyone has a resource that clearly explains all this, I would appreciate it. However, I haven't found anything that covers the ""what-if"" scenarios of future forks for casuals.",1,2017-09-29 18:11:29,17
SOL,Bitcoin,Your experience with btc atms? & looking for a recommendation for a btc atm in nyc,"I’d like to give a btc atm a shot.

I am in NYC. I would not mind hopping on the train to visit a particular atm if it is recommended over others.

For now I am interested in purchasing more btc and not selling any, but would prefer to transact with a service provider that allows the ability for both for when the day comes that I’d like to take a little out.

I have a hunch that bank transfers and purchases with debit cards through the cashapp/Coinbase (Pro)/etc/w/e are the cheapest and am wondering if there are any btc atms that rival the fees one would find with the above mentioned.

Some additional points:

-Kyc is not a problem for me. I would however prefer to not have to do any kyc. From my browsing of posts on here it seems some atms do not require kyc for smaller amounts. I am curious if I’d find any atms like this in NYC/NY State/The U.S. or if this is only found in certain states/countries/wherever...

-the two closest btc atms near me are powered (powered?) by ‘coinsource’ and ‘coinbtm.’ I checked out coinsource, and it pretty much only touts buying btc from them and virtually nowhere is selling btc to them mentioned, except in 1 small place, which makes me think that this feature isn’t going to be found very often with these btc atms.

-fees, miner fee, convenience fee/service fee, fee baked into the spread, what should I expect...? I’d not be surprised if these services hit you with all 3.

-shall I make sure to have my own addresses ready to provide to the atm for where the btc will be sent to, or will I be using the atm’s wallet/app (I imagine their software, if it is done this way, being buggy and custodial...)

-speaking of buggy, about a week ago or so, I recall a post on here of someone sharing their experience with a btc atm. Coincidentally they were also based in the nyc area. the post was more like them complaining about the atm eating their money and not finishing the transacting as it should have been. They were concerned that they were SOL, especially because the support team for whatever atm service he was using was seemingly inaccessible/not answering their phone support. I don’t want to get stuck in a situation like that...

-Have you yourself used a btc atm, just for kicks? What was your experience like?

SOL,Bitcoin,Coinme Coinstar - Review / potential warning,"EDIT:  5 mins after i posted this they called me and said that their compliance office cleared me and i was allowed access to my account.  Hopefully others that choose to use their service don't have the same experience.

&#x200B;

TLDR at the bottom.

Good Morning all,

I figured i'd share my experience with buying bitcoin through coinstar / coinme since i saw a lot of posts on the roll out but no actual details.

The price was better than other bitcoin atms ive used in the past (%4 fee & their rate for bitcoin was 160 over market, other BTMs in my area are 500+ over market & have similar % fees.)

&#x200B;

The process of purchasing bitcoin through coinstar was simple and straight forward.  It doesn't seem like you will even NEED to understand how to use a wallet to buy and HODL.

&#x200B;

The trouble started when i went to redeem the voucher.  I was able to submit the KYC pictures of my ID  multiple times, but the selfie wouldn't upload (which was weird because when i long held the broken picture place holder i could download my selfie just fine)

&#x200B;

Upon speaking with customer service they don't even see a record of my KYC data being submitted & now ill need to wait for their chief compliance officer to call me and manually verify my identity.

&#x200B;

I'm forced to wonder if the trouble that they are creating is intentional...  if I had only bought $5 or so there is NO WAY i would be going through this much trouble to claim it.

&#x200B;

Has anyone else tried Coinme through coinstar?  What was your experience.

&#x200B;

TLDR:  Buying is easy, but you may be SOL when you try to actually redeem the coin.

SOL,Bitcoin,Paying for goods using multisig?,"I was trying to buy stuff from individuals (not merchants) over the internet using bitcoins, and the age-old bitcoin problem struck me: There's little buyer-protection mechanism to speak of, I have to trust the seller. If I pay first and the seller decides to screw me and not deliver, I'm SOL; but if the seller agrees to receive payment later, he/she gets the same problem. Obviously if we both trust a third party to hold the coins in escrow, we get bitcoin-paypal, and that kinda defeats the point of bitcoin.

The best thing my puny brain can think of is have a multi-sig address, where both the seller and buyer keys are required to spend from; the seller can verify that the buyer indeed sent money into it, but cannot get the money until buyer receive the delivery and approve the spending. While the buyer can still screw the seller by not approving, she has no incentive to do so because she can't get the money back, it's lost to the void if no approval was made. The system might be made better by having a time-lock where if the buyer does nothing for X amount of time the funds are released and spendable using the seller key, but buyer can still actively disapprove.

Is there a quick and painless way to do this, or is there better ways to trustlessly buy stuff without giving the seller reasons to screw me? ",3,2015-06-05 19:40:47,9

One catch, I noticed that they required a SSN, which quite frankly I refuse to give to anyone unless they can provide proof of its requirement for tax purposes only. Many people ask for it (e.g. rental applications, schools) as an easy identification tool, but have no legal right to do so and often there are other documents that are sufficient. Anyone have experience with opening a Gemini account w/o a SSN? I am happy to provide other documents (drivers license, passport, bills, credit score), just not ones that put me at risk of identity theft. Am I SOL as far as opening an account with them?",2,2017-03-05 23:13:31,4
SOL,Bitcoin,Exchanges Making Use of Payment Channels,"Thinking through how the lightning network works at a technical level had me thinking that bi-directional payment channels could be implemented on exchanges to keep 3rd party risk to near zero.

This is how I see it working:

* User and Exchange create a 2 of 2 multi sig wallet together.  

* User deposits 2 BTC into this wallet

* At the time of deposit the exchange monitors the address and sends back a pre-signed transaction that will the user to recover the funds if the exchange goes down.

* If the user trades with the BTC to another coin, the balance in the payment channel is updated and the signed transactions are sent back to the user.  Example user trades .5 btc for 10 XYZ coin, the exchange would update the signed transaction to allow for sending only 1.5BTC back to the user, and would hopefully also enter into a 2 of 2 multi sig address the 10 XYZ coin, as to protect that coin as well.

* When the user wants to withdraw, he just signs the transaction the exchange has already sent, and the withdraw is complete, no need to rely on a custodial service.

* The user would also have to sign the other side of the transaction to protect the exchange so they can get the coins if they trade them or sell them.  Would probably have to provides signed transaction before sells happen.  If all user does is buy or have coins sitting on the exchange, this would not be required, as the exchange does not ever have to keep your coins.

Things That I think this could help with:

* Fractional Banking on exchanges.  If all coins are tied up in a 2of2 multi-sig, then there can be no fractional reserve, as you have tied each of the coins to the end user

* Creating less of a honeypot.  By tying funds up in a 2 of 2 multi sig, you create less of a honeypot on exchanges.  If the exchange gets hacked, all they could do would be to close the payment channel and send the user the funds that are rightly their.

While I do believe this could happen today, this is a perfect use case to have an exchange that is totally driven by the lightning network.  It would only be centralized for the order book and actual creation of 2 of 2 multi sig signatures.  If they started going down, everyone else could get their money out (Because they have a signed transaction to get the coins back), but the first couple people who do not receive the signed transaction would still be SOL.  

I would love for people to poke technical holes in this.  Exchanges what would they think about this ?  I am sure I am over-simplifying this, but it makes me even more excited for the lightning network to take off.

I sent one coin from a wallet that had a greater balance than 1. It sent the coin correctly, then created a 'change' address for the remainder (which oddly showed up as a duplicate in my address list) and immediately flushed this to another address which I am assuming is owned by a miner since that address doesn't show up in my address list. When I say immediately, I mean that both transactions have EXACTLY the same time stamp on them.

How could this transaction (from a change address created with my key to a miner) occur without my private key? How is that possible?

I'm guess I'm SOL but any ideas what went on here?

I've since moved the remainder of my coin out of mSigna hoping never to use it again. There is zero support and emails to the company go unanswered sadly.

2. With exchange of bitcoins (say, for buying/selling of services), is it correct that if you don't receive your goods but have sent your bitcoins, you're shit out of luck? Ie., zero protection?

3. Is it correct to understand that once you have your bitcoins, you can trade via any exchange worldwide? (ie., you're not limited to trading in your own country).

4. Why would Mt. Gox ask me for personal information (full name, DOB, Home address) if one of the main features is anonymity? (don't mind, this is a curiosity thing really)

SOL,Bitcoin,E(xplained)LI5: bitcoin security basics,"There are so many malware and phishing scams going on out there, it is always a worry on the mind. How do we KNOW our coins are safe? First, think in the context that your system(s) and web wallets WILL be compromised at some point. So, what is the best course of action?

The most secure way to store your coins is under a private key that has never, ever seen the light of day on a computer that is connected to the internet. That means, generate it with an offline wallet and write down the key (or wallet seed) and put in a secure place. Do not store this private key anywhere online, encrypted or not. Don't print it on a printer with memory ([edit] or add BIP38 encryption so you can safely print, but then write down that password or burn it to memory). Write it down and keep it in a safe place. This is the only sure-fire way to be certain you will not be susceptible to a security breach.

For conveniently spendable coins, keep a minimum in your online wallets at any one time. Never keep a large bitcoin stash in an online web/software wallet. Relying on passwords, 2FA, virus detection software, etc. will always be vulnerable to a security breach, and once coins are stolen they are gone! Keeping your coins under a private key never exposed to the network gives you peace of mind that your coins are safe, even in the case of a breach.

There are plenty of instructions how to make and use offline wallets out there, and hardware wallets will make this even easier in the near future.

So to summarize: assume that your computer WILL be compromised, and always be conscious of where that private key has been (ie. on an offline wallet and/or written down and in a safe place.)

[edit] many ask the question: how can I send bitcoins to a wallet that has never been on the blockchain? ie. how can I create a wallet completely offline, and have the blockchain know about it? The answer is simple: you can send bitcoins to ANY syntacticly valid address. So lets say you generate a new address with your offline wallet and you get a private key and public address. You then take that public address to an online wallet and send bitcoins to it. The once unknown address will then spring to life on the block chain with the coins in it. Now, if you make up a wallet address and you don't have the private key to that address, you are SOL and those coins are gone forever. However since this address was generated from a private key in your offline wallet, you are able to sign transactions for that address.",6,2014-02-12 19:29:48,3

SOL,Bitcoin,"How are bitcoins a ""credit card killer?""","Honest question (and I own bitcoins).. Keep seeing this being said on Reddit, and I don't quite understand the reasoning, though I would like to. How are bitcoins a credit card killer? 

Credit cards: 1) obviously allow you to buy on credit and MANY people use credit cards to buy things that they don't have the capital to purchase outright... And 2) with a credit card you are to an extent protected against fraudulent purchases, whereas if your bitcoin is stolen or if you lose your offline wallet, your hard drive crashes, the exchange you keep your bitcoins in decides to run away with them (since they are untraceable), etc, you're kind of SOL. 

Do people say bitcoins are a credit card killer because you can make purchases with bitcoins online without using a credit card? Wouldn't using a debit card be kind of the same thing, but with decreased risk? If generally tech-savvy early adopters of bitcoin ate losing them, having them stolen, etc., how will the majority of the public in your opinion fare with them? Seems to be a high risk with losing bitcoins to me.. And using a credit or debit card vastly decreases this risk.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,"D.O.G.E on Ethereum Hit $500m, D.O.G.E on Solana Hit $100m, D.O.G.E on BASE is at Just $500k. Another 10x+ Call Incoming!","I've **consistently made 10x+ calls** over the past few months with projects like Ikigai (200x), DFNDR (120x), PalmAI (100x), Nitefeeder (50x), Drip (20x), NeiRei (14x), and many more. My track record speaks for itself—just check my [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1f951t3/missed_my_200x_on_ikigai_heres_another_chance/) or [Twitter](https://x.com/Cryptovechkin) history for the **receipts**.

Now that I have your attention, let’s talk about another **gem with MASSIVE** potential.

Whether or not you like Elon Musk or Donald Trump, the reality is that **D.O.G.E** (Department of Government Efficiency) **will stay relevant for at least the next four years**. Donald Trump has officially started [D.O.G.E](https://x.com/doge) and appointed **Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead it**.

This means that **D.O.G.E will be everywhere**—TV, social media, public transit, billboards, you name it. Even if you aren’t a fan of Elon Musk, you can still profit from his influence.

D.O.G.E on **Ethereum** recently pumped to a **$500 million market cap** and shows no signs of slowing down. D.O.G.E on **Solana** hit a **$100 million market cap** and also looks strong.

But the real gem is on **BASE chain**. D.O.G.E on BASE is sitting at a tiny **$500,000 market cap**—just **$0.0005 per coin**! If it reaches Solana’s D.O.G.E market cap, that would be a **200x from here**, and a **1000x** if it reaches **Ethereum’s D.O.G.E** market cap.

D.O.G.E doesn’t even need marketing—Elon Musk and the President of the United States will essentially market it for **free across social media**. You can’t beat that kind of exposure.

With **Bitcoin** recently hitting **$95,000 USD**, the bull market has officially started. Having been through multiple bull runs, I can tell you that every chain will get its time to shine. With Ethereum gas fees continuing to rise, people will look to chains with **lower gas fees** like **BASE**.

Plus, D.O.G.E on BASE has been trending in **the top 5** on [Dextools](https://www.dextools.io/app/en/token/dogeonbase?t=1731655165196) since its launch. As people migrate to BASE chain, they’ll see the top trending coins and instantly recognize D.O.G.E. It's obvious what they would buy.

The key to maximizing profit is to get in **before the masses**. D.O.G.E has the **perfect narrative**, a cheap token price, a relentless community, and **virtually unlimited marketing** that would surely take this to the moon!

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,SOLAMA: The Llama of the Crypto Universe on Solana,"Hello, r/CryptoMoonShots! Today, I’d like to introduce you to a token that’s not just another crypto, but a playful meme sensation: SOLAMA. 

Website: https://solama.vip  
**What is SOLAMA?**  
SOLAMA is a rising star in the meme coin universe on the Solana blockchain. Much like Shiba Inu on Ethereum, SOLAMA brings a playful twist with its llama-themed charm. It’s where crypto meets humor, and it’s on a journey to become the next big meme coin sensation on Solana.  
**Tokenomics**  
SOLAMA keeps it simple and straightforward. The total supply is 690,420,000. There are no taxes, no hidden fees. LP tokens are burnt, and contract ownership is renounced.  
**Why SOLAMA Could Be a Potential Moonshot**  
SOLAMA operates within the Solana ecosystem, which is already a well-established and respected platform in the crypto world. Has a good pun as a name and a fun memeable animal.  
**Pros and Cons**  
Pros:  
 \- Scalability: Thanks to Solana’s PoH and PoS consensus, SOLAMA benefits from fast processing times and scalability.  
 \- Meme Potential: With its llama-themed charm, SOLAMA has a strong meme potential, which could drive its popularity.

  
Cons:  
 \- Competition: Solana, and by extension SOLAMA, faces stiff competition from other DeFi platforms.  
 \- Market Volatility: Like all cryptocurrencies, SOLAMA is subject to market volatility.

  
**Conclusion**  
While SOLAMA shows promise, it’s crucial to approach it with a critical eye. Always DYOR and make sure to evaluate each project carefully. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and critiques on SOLAMA!

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$CHAD on SOLANA - The 4CHAN OG MEME,"Have you heard about $CHAD on Solana yet? If not, it’s incredibly undervalued right now. With the momentum around cult coins and movement-based tokens, $CHAD has serious potential to become one of the big names on Solana. Just look at GIGA, which is already at a $660 million market cap, and you’ll see why $CHAD could be next in line.

The $CHAD Story So Far
Launched only three days ago on Pumpfun, $CHAD went through its initial dip, dropping from a $130K market cap to around $30K. But with a strong community—including some supportive whales—$CHAD made a massive comeback. Within just 48 hours, it surged to a $1.3 million market cap! 🚀

Why $CHAD Has Big Potential
The “Chad” meme isn’t new; its roots go all the way back to the early 2000s, though it really gained traction in the late 2010s. The concept of ""Chad"" vs. ""Virgin"" came from forums like 4chan and Reddit, contrasting an idealized, confident man (""Chad"") with an insecure, awkward one (""Virgin"").

The Virgin vs. Chad subreddit alone has over 190K members who post daily, and “Chad” is consistently ranked among the top 3 memes worldwide. Similar to how PEPE and WOJAK memes found their footing, $CHAD has what it takes to be Solana’s unique and iconic meme.

Perfect Timing on Solana
With Solana approaching its all-time highs and bringing in more trading volume, meme coins like $CHAD stand to gain a lot. Plus, the team has big marketing plans targeting 4chan and other channels to keep building momentum.

Don’t miss out! This could be the next big meme on Solana..

$HEGE is a meme of a hedgehog with a story and a cast of supporting characters (explained on the website). This is a unique meme (and not just the thousandth dog, cat, frog, elon, etc copycat) where its graphics are carefully crafted by graphic designers on the team and not just shoved into an AI generator. This care and meticulousness shows and requires tons of work, but the team is relentless. The results of their efforts and the community's efforts show up in all areas of this project and has led to a top notch community with top notch contributors.

As the community grows and starts to compound (over 20x users in Telegram and over 15x followers on Twitter since launch), the price of $HEGE has also followed. This project is now starting to gain traction and get the attention of a larger audience with more significant influencers taking notice and is poised to have a major upside breakout.

The community, the comradery, and the laughs have been great, but nothing beats the potential of a huge return.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,The Solana Meme Coin Racing to the Moon with a Lambo Burn Stunt,"I've stumbled upon a new Solana-based meme coin project that's been making waves recently, and I think it's worth a deep dive. It's called POWSCHE, and it's based off the popular “need money for Porsche” meme, with the idea being that all holders will be able to buy Porsche cars, using profits from their Powsche  
  
It's a long term project with a dedicated community, explosive growth, and some wild plans that could make it the next big thing.  
  
Here's what you need to know:  
  
**Explosive Growth**  
  
Since its launch, POWSCHE has seen its market cap skyrocket from a modest $7k to an impressive $500k. This rapid growth is a testament to the project's potential and the community's enthusiasm.  
  
**Viral Marketing Stunts**  
  
Hold onto your seats because, at a $100 million market cap, the POWSCHE team plans to purchase a Lamborghini Aventador and burn it live while drifting a GT3RS around it. This stunt aims to create a media frenzy and propel POWSCHE to even greater heights  
  
**Community and Dev Commitment**  
  
The project boasts a very active and passionate Telegram community. What's more, the developers have shown their commitment by not selling off any tokens, even after hitting all-time highs. This level of dedication is rare and speaks volumes about the project's integrity.  
  
**Good RugCheck score**  
  
POWSCHE has a good RugCheck score, indicating it's a relatively safe investment. You can check the score yourself here:  
  
https://rugcheck.xyz/tokens/8CkiSHHJDHJV4LUoiRMLUhqG58cUkbyJRtcP4Z3mCXNf  
  
**Bullish Price Graph**  
  
The price graph for POWSCHE is showing signs of a bullish ascending flag pattern. This pattern suggests that after a period of consolidation, we're likely to see a significant move upwards. In fact, a breakout has been observed in the past 2 hours, confirming the bullish sentiment:  
  
https://dexscreener.com/solana/8CkiSHHJDHJV4LUoiRMLUhqG58cUkbyJRtcP4Z3mCXNf  
  
**Clear Roadmap to $100M Market Cap**  
  
The roadmap for POWSCHE is detailed and ambitious, with clear milestones set for market caps of $1M, $10M, and $100M. These include airdrops, exchange listings, a DAO launch, token supply burns, and the aforementioned Lambo burn stunt  
  
**Additional Info**

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Introducing $PRINT: A Revolutionary Solana Reflection Token The Biggest Step Of The Future,"What is $PRINT?  
$PRINT is a revolutionary Solana reflection token that provides passive income to holders through auto-rewards in Solana (SOL). Unlike traditional reflection tokens that rely on manual swaps, $PRINT utilizes a unique auto-swap script to convert token taxes into SOL and distribute them directly to holders’ wallets. This innovative approach ensures that holders receive their rewards seamlessly and efficiently.  
  
Key Features of $PRINT  
 • 8% Tax: $PRINT implements an 8% tax on all transactions, including transfers and swaps.  
 • 6% Auto-Rewards: 6% of the tax is distributed as auto-rewards in SOL directly to holders’ wallets.  
 • 2% Operations Wallet: The remaining 2% of the tax is allocated to the Operations Wallet, which is used to fund the development and marketing of $PRINT.  
  
How Does $PRINT Auto-Swap Work?  
The $PRINT auto-swap script operates periodically, collecting all available taxes generated through transactions and swaps. These collected $PRINT tokens are then stored in the Rewards Distribution Wallet (PrintRewards.sol).  
Once the minimum swap threshold of 1 million $PRINT is met, the script automatically swaps the tokens for SOL. 25% of the acquired SOL is sent to the Marketing Wallet (PrintMarketing.sol), while the remaining 75% is distributed proportionally to all $PRINT holders based on their holdings.  
  
Early Success of $PRINT  
$PRINT has experienced remarkable growth since its launch, attracting over 25,000 holders and generating over $17 million in trading volume. The token has also distributed over $1 million in rewards to its community.  
  
PrintPad™: Solana’s Auto Swap Tax Solution  
PrintPad™ is an upcoming Solana-powered platform that will revolutionize the way projects manage their taxes. PrintPad™ will enable developers to connect their Tax Withdrawal Authorities to the platform, allowing $PRINT’s auto-swap script to seamlessly convert their taxes into SOL and deposit them directly into their marketing wallets.  
  
Benefits of $PRINT for Project Developers  
 • Streamlined Tax Management: PrintPad™ simplifies tax management by automatically converting taxes into SOL, eliminating the need for manual swaps.  
  
 • Enhanced Rewards: 5% of all taxes collected for linked projects will be directed to an auto-buyback wallet, providing consistent buy pressure and elevating rewards for $PRINT holders.  
  
Why Choose $PRINT?  
If you’re looking for a revolutionary Solana reflection token that offers passive income, seamless auto-rewards, and a supportive community, $PRINT is the ideal choice. With its innovative auto-swap mechanism and the upcoming PrintPad™ platform, $PRINT is poised to revolutionize the Solana ecosystem.  
  
Join the $PRINT Revolution  
Get involved with the $PRINT community today and experience the power of passive income through Solana’s first auto-swap reflection token. Stay tuned for exciting developments and the launch of PrintPad™!

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,SatOllie's Diaries: from the genesis of Bitcoin until the present day ($BTC on Solana),"**8/8/2024: The Genesis of Bitcoin**
SatOllie here! After reading that token creation on pump fun is now FREE, my mind went into overdrive. A peer-to-peer electronic cash system. A currency that could change everything. I felt this rush of excitement, the same feeling I imagine the original Satoshi had when he penned his Bitcoin whitepaper. I dropped the link in the ""Street Bets"" Discord. Time to see if the world was ready. Spoiler alert: they weren’t. Not yet.

**9/8/2024: The Slow Drip**
Woke up and checked the chart, expecting to see fireworks... instead, just a few buys trickling in. Street Bets was too busy getting rugged by some presale coin to notice my groundbreaking creation. Classic. Oh well, early days, and patience is key.

**10/8/2024: The Rise Begins**
Boom! We’re gaining traction! Word has spread about this revolutionary digital currency called Bitcoin, and throughout the morning the buys kept rolling in. By midday, we hit King of the Hill status! We even started a Telegram group, and I’m feeling this nostalgia vibe - it’s like the Bitcoin forums and newsgroups all over again. I paid for a Dexscreener listing in anticipation of bonding, and to show my commitment to the project.

**11/8/2024: Jeet and Repeat**
The King of the Hill high didn’t last long. Some folks jeeted hard, as expected. A lesson learned from the old Bitcoin days: not everyone has diamond hands. But the vibe in our Telegram channel? Electric. It feels like a time machine straight to 2009, with OGs reminiscing about the early Bitcoin days. The community is small, but it’s mighty.

**12/8/2024: Pump Fun Shenanigans**
Thanks to some generous investors, we now have marketing funds. Time to play with the big boys. We launched a bump bot on pump fun because, let’s face it, visibility is everything. Market cap’s creeping towards $60k. Slow but steady wins the race. It’s crazy watching history repeat itself, but now in this wild west of meme tokens and SOL bonds.

**13/8/2024: The Raydium Rollercoaster**
Someone dropped 30 SOL on $BTC today, finally completing the pump fun bonding curve and launching us on Raydium! It was glorious for about five minutes before they immediately sold off, tanking the price in a sharp drop. Oh, the joys of early crypto markets—wild swings and instant heartbreak. Onward and upward!

**14/8/2024: Jeet Storm**
$BTC is now live on Raydium! The market cap hit $54k for a hot second before the inevitable jeeting began. Totally normal, and honestly, I’m not even mad. It’s part of the process. The thrill of the game keeps me going.

**15-16/8/2024: The Raid Begins**
We’ve built a solid Telegram community—200 strong and growing! Raids are happening everywhere: Reddit, X, you name it. We’re making noise. The people need to know about this coin, and we’re here to make sure they do.

**17-19/8/2024: The Calm After the Storm**
The weekend was quiet—too quiet. Most of the early pump fun buyers have taken their profits and moved on, leaving us at a $13k market cap. But this? This is where the real fun begins. We’ve formed a strong floor, and the diehards remain.

**20/8/2024: The Diamond Hands Chronicles Begin**

The Telegram has become one big LARP, and honestly, we’re having a blast. Memes, jokes, and talks of the glory days are keeping us going, but make no mistake—we’re still in this for the gains. The dream? To push this market cap high enough that we can all afford some pizza with our $BTC. The laughs are great, but we’ve got our eyes on that moon. Time to rebuild and send it.

**SatOllie out.** 💎✋ Let’s keep making history.

Bitcoin ($BTC) is the first LARP-driven memecoin on the Solana network.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Introducing Bitcorn - The First and Only Solana DEX Token with Unique Potential,"Hello, fellow crypto enthusiasts. I am excited to share a fresh and innovative project that has recently entered the market: Bitcorn. This project is designed to stand out not only with its unique concept but also with its strong technical foundation and early-stage investment opportunity.

Why Bitcorn?

Bitcorn is a creative fusion of Bitcoin’s credibility and the charm of simplicity, represented by corn. While the concept is playful, the project itself is backed by a serious mission: to be the first and only token exclusively available on Solana DEX. This ensures high-speed transactions and low fees, leveraging Solana’s superior blockchain technology.

The project aims to create a sustainable and rewarding ecosystem for its holders, focusing on long-term growth rather than short-term hype. With a limited supply and a solid roadmap, Bitcorn is positioned to be a standout project in the competitive crypto market.

Key Features:

 • Built on Solana: Faster and cheaper transactions compared to many other blockchains.
 • First on Solana DEX: Bitcorn holds a unique place as the only token of its kind on this platform.
 • Community-Centric: The team is highly active and committed to building a loyal and informed community of investors.

Tokenomics and Launch Details:

Bitcorn has a total supply of [X] tokens, with fair distribution to ensure no whales dominate the market. The initial liquidity is locked, providing added security for early investors. With the project still in its early stages, this is an excellent opportunity to join before the broader market takes notice.

The first ever anonymous Visa® card for DeFi. Invest on BSC and spend in the real world. Two months on, and it's been an amazing journey. All milestones to date have been smashed.

⚪️ THE PHILOSOPHY ⚪️

The KYC process is slowly closing in on DeFi. Don’t KYC (DKYC) stands for financial liberation that transcends race, creed, social status, and region. DKYC asserts that everyday spending should not fall under the sword of “suspicious activity”. DKYC stands for global freedom to live life and perform micro-transactions using cryptocurrency, without the unfair and harsh judgement of government bodies or regulators.

This is a f\*\*\*ing moonshot IMO.

Only 100 were minted, making this a premium collectible token. The deflationary scarcity model used by SOL100 is designed for one reason..

3. Only 100 exist

Conclusion: This is more or less a clone of 42-coin, but with a Solana ecosystem slingshot it could be a serious thing. The TLDR is that there are only 100 tokens and that makes them rare and collectible. It taps into NFT psychology and could absolutely perform well.",1108,2021-10-15 19:17:26,166

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$URF Token on Solana Network | New Token for the Unfortunate SOLs Out There,"Hey, fellow crypto enthusiasts! Gather around, gather around, for a tale as old as time... Well, not quite, but close enough. So, picture this: my nephew, who's name rhymes with URF, decides he's the next big shot in the crypto world. Spoiler alert: he's not. Kid burns through cash faster than you can say ""blockchain."" But fear not, for yours truly, Uncle $URF, has swooped in to save the day. Ah, the joys of family, right?  
  
Now, let's talk business. We're a memecoin on Solana because, let's face it, Ethereum's gas fees are higher than Elon Musk's ambitions. Our cap? A cool 4000 SOL. Yes, we like to dream big, but not ""Bitcoin hitting $1 million tomorrow"" big. We're realistic dreamers, you see.  
  
As for our allocation strategy, it's as straightforward as explaining blockchain to your grandma. 50% to the Liquidity Pool because, hey, stability is key. 10% to the unfortunate victims of my nephews escapades. Poor souls, they didn't stand a chance. And the remaining 40%? Well, that's going straight into our sale. Gotta keep the $URF train chugging along, am I right?  
  
So, buckle up, strap in, and get ready for the ride of your crypto life. This ain't your grandma's altcoin; this is $URF, the memecoin that's here to prove that even in the wild west of crypto, there's room for a little laughter... and a lot of profit. Welcome aboard, folks. Let's make some waves, or should I say, transactions?

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Foxville.app is blockchain farm gaming on Solana - 2D NFTs Whitelist is live Mint @ 0.5_SOL,"Foxville derives its competitive edge from updated features that its offer, which includes NFT staking, multiverses, cross-chain interoperability, DAO and many other features. Foxville is user friendly and forward looking platform that aims at evolving as a community.

Fair Comparison…

Foxville is a decentralized play to earn gaming platform that has integrated DeFi and gaming. It is a GameFi. It has an exciting farm based game unlike the usual old centralized free to play Farmville. Foxville has 11 different categories and 176 versatile traits. A quick comparison between the two can make it clear.  


&#x200B;

| **Foxville** | **Farmville**||
|:-|:-|:-|
| Play to earn| Free to play||
| Decentralized| Centralized ||
| Multiverses| One universe||
| Better visuals, AR, VR| Augmented reality ||

  
 

This was a quick comparison between our childhood favorite, Farmville and blockchain integrated GameFi, Foxville. However, there are other farm based games on blockchain too.  


&#x200B;

| **Foxville** | **FarmTown** | **CryptoBytes**|
|:-|:-|:-|
| Play to earn| Free to play | Fun to play|
| Decentralized| Centralized | Decentralized|
| PVE and PVP| PVE| PVE |
| Native token| World currencies | Native token|
| AR, VR| AR | AR|
| Multiverses | One screen| No multiverses|
| Cross-chain interoperability| No cross chain interoperability| No cross chain interoperability|
| Solana Blockchain| \-----| Binance smart chain |

  
 The game of Foxville depends majorly on Fox-Farmers. These Fox-Farmers will be able to harvest crops, and perform other farm duties to create a lavishing farm. These farmers can then sell their assets in the Foxville marketplace to generate wealth to upgrade their living standard and their farm.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,"EGO Expands Multi-Chain Presence: Launching $EGO Bridge to Tron, Joining Solana and Base for Enhanced Memecoin Growth","As a proud holder of $EGO, I am excited to share some significant developments that promise to elevate our community and the token's value. This Thursday, during the Weekly EGO Show, we will witness the launch of the highly anticipated $EGO bridge to the Tron network. This expansion is a major milestone for $EGO, marking its presence across multiple blockchain platforms. With substantial traction already achieved on Solana and Base, integrating with Tron further solidifies $EGO’s position in the competitive crypto space.

Why is This Integration Significant?

Tron is swiftly becoming a prominent hub for memecoins, and this is big news for us $EGO holders. The Tron network offers low transaction fees, high liquidity, and a rapidly expanding ecosystem that rivals established networks like Solana and Ethereum. Under Justin Sun’s leadership, Tron has been actively promoting memecoins such as Sundog, which have already made significant waves in the market. By bridging $EGO to Tron, we are strategically positioning ourselves to tap into this vibrant and growing market, thereby enhancing our visibility and adoption among memecoin enthusiasts.

Benefits of the $EGO-Tron Bridge:

1. Increased Exposure: Expanding to Tron allows $EGO to reach a broader audience within the memecoin community. This increased visibility can attract more investors and users, potentially driving up the token’s value and utility.

2. Enhanced Transaction Efficiency: Tron's blockchain is renowned for its low-cost transactions and fast processing times. As a result, $EGO holders will benefit from quicker and more economical trades, making our trading experience smoother and more cost-effective.

3. Cross-Chain Utility: With integrations across Solana, Base, and now Tron, $EGO is establishing itself as a versatile token with robust cross-chain functionality. This multi-chain presence ensures that $EGO remains accessible and functional across various blockchain ecosystems, increasing its utility and appeal.

What This Means for the Future of $EGO:

The introduction of the Tron bridge is expected to act as a catalyst for $EGO's continued growth and adoption. Our strong and supportive community has already shown immense backing for $EGO, and this strategic move could propel the token to new heights. By expanding our reach and enhancing our functionality, $EGO is well-positioned to drive significant value and establish itself as a leading memecoin in the market.

Join Us for the Big Reveal:

As a dedicated holder, I encourage all community members to mark their calendars for this Thursday at 6 PM UTC / 2 PM EST. This launch is a pivotal moment for $EGO, and being part of this event will allow us to witness firsthand the expansion and promising future that lies ahead for our token. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to celebrate and support the growth of $EGO.

https://linktr.ee/egosociety

Get ready to take $EGO to the next level. Let’s move forward together and achieve new milestones in our crypto journey!

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Introducing KittenWifHat : The Next Big Solana Project,"Greetings, crypto enthusiasts! I'm excited to introduce **KittenWifHat (KITTENWIF)**, a new, community-driven coin that's gearing up to be the next major success on the Solana blockchain. Our project draws on the experience of the same team behind Baby BNB, which saw a staggering 330x growth from its presale price, skyrocketing from $60K to $22M. Our team is committed to transparency and security, demonstrated by being the first Solana project to receive a full suite of PinkSale badges: Doxxed team, SAFU, KYC, Audit, and AMA sessions.

&#x200B;

We've allocated over $200K to our marketing efforts to ensure KittenWifHat makes a splash across key platforms such as GECKOTERMINAL, DEXVIEW, DEXTOOLS, and AVEDEX upon launch. Additionally, we're on the fast track for listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, with planned listings on BitMart and MEXC to expand our reach.

&#x200B;

**What sets KittenWifHat apart?** Aside from our engaging theme and experienced team, we've ensured there are no buy or sell fees to make transactions as straightforward as possible. Liquidity is a priority for us; 60% of LP tokens are locked for one year to stabilize and secure our market presence.

&#x200B;

**Interested in getting involved? We launch at 12.4.2024 at 4pm utc.**

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Solana’s Next Big Thing: LandWolf’s Surge in the Meme Coin Market,"In the dynamic realm of cryptocurrencies, meme coins often present the most tantalizing opportunities for swift wealth generation. Even in a bearish market, enthusiasts and speculators are on the lookout for the next big leap that could secure them substantial gains.

Enter LandWolf, a rising star associated with the popular Pepe meme. Boasting a market cap exceeding $91 million and a 24-hour trading volume surpassing $35 million, $WOLF is poised to become Solana's leading meme coin.

Read on to explore the potential of LandWolf and how it stacks up against well-known meme coins like Pepe and Brett.

LandWolf (WOLF): A Meme Coin Revolution on Solana

Tied closely to Pepe the Frog, LandWolf is a fresh meme coin aiming to bridge Pepe’s fanbase with the wider crypto community. Its engaging and playful nature has sparked significant buzz, putting $WOLF on a fast track to becoming Solana's top meme coin.

As a core member of the Boys Club, LandWolf has earned the trust and support of the degen community. With over 5k active members on Telegram and more than 5k followers on X, WOLF’s popularity is surging. Influencers like InvestWithRex, who famously bought a purple Lamborghini to showcase his confidence in the project, are among its supporters.

LandWolf's potential is underscored by its association with the Boys Club team. With $PEPE valued at approximately $5 billion and $BRETT at $1.3 billion, LandWolf appears poised to join the ranks of multi-billion dollar projects soon. The pressing question is: will you seize this opportunity early, or miss out on a potential six-figure gain?

Pepe (PEPE): The Meme Coin Phenomenon

Pepe, inspired by a beloved internet meme from the early 2000s, ranks as the third-largest meme coin by market cap. Despite its lack of practical use, $PEPE soared in May 2023, minting overnight millionaires. Now a staple in the meme coin space, Pepe sparked a new wave of crypto enthusiasm.

Currently priced at $0.00001118, Pepe has seen an 8% decline over the past week. This dip is a normal market fluctuation and unlikely to impact the project’s long-term prospects. For now, undervalued projects with significant upside and robust teams offer the best investment potential.

Brett (BRETT): Base Chain’s Meme Coin Marvel

BRETT, another Boys Club-inspired meme coin, has made waves on the Base blockchain. Despite lacking a clear roadmap or utility, BRETT has cultivated a dedicated community, reaching a $1.9 billion ATH in June.

BRETT’s price recently stabilized around $0.14 after a peak of $0.15. This correction is typical post-ATH behavior and shouldn’t affect the coin’s long-term value.

Conclusion

While the market undergoes a minor correction, LandWolf is steadily gaining momentum. With a strong team and a loyal community, $WOLF is on track to dominate Solana's meme coin landscape by 2024. Don't miss this potential 100x investment opportunity.

Invest in $WOLF today and join the Solana degens!

For more information, please visit Web, follow $WOLF on Twitter, and join the Telegram community.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$TMT or the long-term project with the potential to enter top 10 memecoins on Solana,"Tomato is a new memecoin project backed by guys from the OG projects such as AxieInfinity, DexTools, and others.

Looking at the statistics of memecoin launches on SOL, only 0.4% do not fall to zero within 3 days. As a result, people started losing money and getting desperate.

But $TMT is different, they already spent over $400k on building, and going to spend even more

**Where did the $400k go?**

> First ever Tap To Earn game on Solana

> Animated series with a staff of 15 animators

> Marketing with over 300 influencers

> Strategic partnerships with whale's groups and top Solana projects such as DeGods and DexTools

> And other stuff such as design, airdrop site development, etc...

**What are the further $TMT plans?**

Now, a project is focusing on community development through different competitions with a total prize pool of $40,000

And it's a win-win situation for both sides, since by pumping active in $TMT you can earn money and at the same time send your project to the moon, because the most important thing is the community

In other words, if you want to secure 100x gains in the long term and have a lot of fun, $TMT is your project, since it's still early and backed by strong backers

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,CATBAT - Building Utility to Make Solana Ecosystem Safer,"**What is CATBAT?**

It's a project started by the Dev when he got fed up with all the scams running on Solana and decided to use his coding knowledge to build, combine and improve all the usual tools we use to determine if a new project is a scam/rugpull or not. The idea for ScamScout and $CATBAT token was born.

Dev launched the project through moonshot and quickly got a dedicated but small following.

ScamScout as a tool will benefit everyone but especially $CATBAT holders as they will get dividends from the volume that goes through ScamScout.

CATBAT as a character is taking the cat meta that is popular in crypto and combining it with the most popular detective of all time - Batman. It just fits so well for the projects narrative. The character will also be sharing scams and stories on his X account, working for some day to be a trusted ""influencer"" within the community.



**What is SCAMSCOUT?**

ScamScout is a tool that combines and improves every other tool we use before investing in projects on Solana. Rugcheck, Solscan, Holderscan, Bubblemaps etc.

The tool will be built with feedback from the holders and general users. Alpha ver 1 will be out VERY soon and then the first round of feedback will be gathered and from that new features and improvements will be implemented in the next version. Aim is to still provide the tool in usable state and improve continously, so that it will benefit everyone as soon as possible.



**The features ready now:**

1. All socials of the token

2. Price

3. Market Cap

4. Total holders

5. Top 20 holders

6. Vote feature if dev is present or not 

7. Identify if top holder is vault or not (at the moment only implemented on Raydium)



**Will be implemented on next versions:**

8. Identify Developer Wallet

9. Linked Wallets 

10. Identify Meteora Pool 

11. Show transactions and add filters, so you can filter by 0.5 SOL etc.

12. Use tool for free if you hold some amount of CATBAT

13. Track holders increase by date/month

14. Risk analysis

15. Community sentiment

16. Coin audit service

17. Identify if developer has locked supply



**Bots planned:**

CATBAT Scanning Tool

CATBAT Guardian Bot

CATBAT Verification Bot where we would verify trough process if project is legitimate or not



This is the broad strokes plan which will change with the feedback from the community. CATBAT is a long term project and is not promising the moon next week. **Transparency** and **honesty** is the core of CATBAT.



**Organic Growth**

$CATBAT was launched on Moonshot November 1st and has slowly and steadily grown in holders and market cap. There was some turbulence at the start as we had the usual moonshot scoopers who then dumped their tokens. Team has now formed a strategy to have enough liquidity to help buy out massive dips so that the token is less volatile.

Dev locked his tokens for 12 months to show that he is actually serious about the project and that it's not a project with only air and hype as value

At this point Dev is hard at work with the tool. Advertisement/Collabs/Marketing will come along with the release of the Scamscout main tool.  
As always DYOR (which will be easier with Scamscout)

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$HEGE on Solana | Developments & Update,"16 days after launch, the community is growing rapidly and getting stronger quickly with more people volunteering and donating for marketing, meme creation, event planning, and infrastructure buildout.

➡️ Developments

- Over $5,000 has been donated for marketing purposes in the past week.

- HEGE Art will be leveling up. Team is creating a rig of Hege so animations can be made.

- Discord is now up and running, allowing us to serve a new user base that does not use Telegram

- Game night is being planned and will be coming up soon. This will be an opportunity for the community to interact and to raise money for marketing.

- NYC Billboard ads coming up. Planning on showing the ads 88 times during the day.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,The Rise of $BENDOG on Solana Mobile: A Comprehensive Overview,"In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, a new contender is making waves: the $BENDOG token on the Solana blockchain. Supported by high-tier centralized exchanges (CEXs) and bolstered by an airdrop initiative from Solana Mobile, $BENDOG stands on the precipice of potentially significant growth. This article delves into the well-funded team behind $BENDOG, upcoming marketing efforts, and why investors should keep a keen eye on this project. Let's explore the factors contributing to the growing interest in $BENDOG.  
  
A New Dawn in the Solana Ecosystem

  
**The $BENDOG Token Launch**  
  
$BENDOG's entry into the market has been met with enthusiasm, thanks in part to the strategic support from Solana Mobile. This collaboration hints at innovative applications and wider adoption scenarios within the mobile ecosystem, setting $BENDOG apart from its contemporaries.  
  
**Strategic Partnerships and Exchange Listings**  
  
The confirmation of support from high-tier centralized exchanges is a testament to the project's credibility and potential for liquidity. These partnerships not only facilitate easier access and trading for investors but also serve as a vote of confidence in the project's fundamentals.  
  
Behind the Scenes: A Well-Funded Team  
**The Backbone of $BENDOG**  
  
At the core of $BENDOG's promising outlook is a team characterized by robust funding and a strategic vision. This financial backing ensures that the project can weather the volatile crypto market and fund extensive marketing campaigns to boost visibility and adoption.  
  
**Marketing Blitz on the Horizon**  
  
The team behind $BENDOG is gearing up for a comprehensive marketing push, aiming to capture the attention of investors and users across the blockchain sphere. This planned outreach is expected to significantly enhance the token's profile and attractiveness to potential stakeholders.  
  
Why Investors Are Watching $BENDOG  
**Potential for Growth**  
  
The combination of Solana Mobile's airdropping campaign, strategic exchange listings, and an aggressive marketing strategy positions $BENDOG for potential upward mobility in the crypto rankings. These elements, coupled with the project's innovative vision, make it a compelling option for investors seeking growth opportunities.  
  
**DYOR: A Call to Action**  
  
While the buzz around $BENDOG is undeniably exciting, the timeless advice of ""Do Your Own Research"" (DYOR) remains paramount. Prospective investors are encouraged to delve into the project's specifics, team background, and market dynamics before making any investment decisions.  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
As the Solana ecosystem continues to expand and diversify, $BENDOG emerges as a notable project worth monitoring. Its strategic alignment with Solana Mobile, support from high-tier CEXs, and the promise of substantial marketing efforts make it a tantalizing prospect for investors. However, as with any investment in the volatile cryptocurrency market, due diligence is key. The future of $BENDOG offers a mix of potential rewards and challenges, making it a fascinating subject for those interested in the cutting-edge of blockchain technology and finance.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,The Return of r/ wallstreetbets on Solana and the New Meta,"Why is r/ wallstreetbets Making a Comeback?  
Remember r/ wallstreetbets? The legendary subreddit that turned the financial world upside down and gave retail traders a shot at massive gains is back—this time on Solana. This community, which turned memes into market-shaking moves, made history before, and they’re ready to do it again. With a fresh start on a new platform, r/ wallstreetbets is reigniting the wild energy that once dominated the markets. Whether you’re chasing the thrill or hunting for gains, this is where the real action is.

Themed Subreddits and the Rise of Reddit-Inspired Tokens  
Recently, we've seen a wave of tokens inspired by Reddit hit the scene. Themed subreddits like r/ Snoofi, r/ Limmy, and r/ circle are getting a lot of attention, but the standout so far? Reddit Dog. Is this just another trend, or is it the new meta? r/ wallstreetbets is taking this concept and running with it, potentially turning it into the next big thing. With its deep roots in market-shifting culture, this community is poised to lead the charge.

Get Ready for the Next Big Pump  
The buzz is growing, the charts are heating up, and it seems we’re on the verge of another r/ wallstreetbets pump. For those in the know, this could be the opportunity you've been waiting for. Whispers of whales waking up and the market gearing up for a significant move are circulating—now’s the time to position yourself. Keep an eye on the signals, prepare your buy orders, and get ready for a wild ride when this takes off.

Market Reversal: Is r/ wallstreetbets Leading the Charge?  
After a period of dips and sideways movement, the market is finally showing signs of a bullish reversal. The sentiment is shifting, and the bulls are back in action. If you’ve been waiting on the sidelines, now might be the perfect time to jump back in. With its new base on Solana, r/ wallstreetbets is well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum. The reversal is real, and the gains could be substantial—don’t miss out.

r/ wallstreetbets: Still Challenging the Status Quo  
Why r/ wallstreetbets? This is where retail traders came together to flip the script on Wall Street. Born out of a desire to challenge the suits, this community shook the markets and made history. Now, with a new home on Solana, they’re bringing that same unbridled energy back. If you’re looking for a place where the underdog can still win big, r/ wallstreetbets is where you need to be. This is where the degens take the W and make history once again.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$GIGA - The real GigaChad meme on Solana is now building a fitness brand,"Hey GigaChads,

This is the big one. **$GIGA** is here to shake up the meme coin game on Solana! Unlike the countless other projects popping up overnight, $GIGA is based on a real-world meme sensation – the legendary **GigaChad**. 

If you haven't heard, **GigaChad** is a heavyweight in the meme world. It's more than just a meme; it's a lifestyle. Just check Instagram or TikTok, and you'll understand.

Let's face it, meme coins like **DOGE** and **PEPE** didn't become billion-dollar juggernauts by accident. They resonated with the masses because they tapped into memes that everyday people understand and relate to. **$GIGA** aims to follow in their footsteps by leveraging the power of the **GigaChad** meme to onboard the normies and skyrocket to the moon.

But here's the kicker – **$GIGA** isn't just another pump-and-dump scheme. We're taking things to the next level by bridging the gap between the **crypto world and the real world**. How? By launching our very own **fitness apparel brand**! And the best part? The **profits** from our fitness brand will be **reinvested** back into the **$GIGA** ecosystem, ensuring long-term sustainability and growth for our community.

**$GIGA** is currently sitting at a market cap of 11-12 millions, making it a **huge entry opportunity**.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Introducing $BEATS - The Premier RWA Coin Launching on the Solana Chain!,"Hello, fellow crypto enthusiasts!

I am excited to bring to your attention a new and promising project launching on the Solana chain - $BEATS. Mark your calendars for **17th June at 16:00 UTC / 12:00 PM EST** and make sure you don’t miss out on this opportunity!

# Why $BEATS Stands Out:

1. **Contract Address**: GbXdCbkSYot4VUDSWD7cduxhQ5nSYXWC3wZtv1Jov2mN
2. **Mint and Freeze Authority Revoked**: Ensuring that no further tokens can be minted and providing additional security for investors.
3. **Liquidity Locked**: There are no team tokens or unlocked tokens, ensuring stability and trust within the community.
4. **First CEX Listing Completed**: $BEATS has already made its debut on a centralized exchange, showcasing its initial success.

# Key Milestones and Partnerships:

* **Biconomy Confirmed**: A significant listing that boosts credibility.
* **20% of Supply Burned**: Reducing the total supply and increasing scarcity.
* **Rest of Supply Locked**: Ensuring controlled distribution and stability.
* **Upcoming Listings**:
   * **Gate.io Start-Up**: Expanding reach and accessibility.
   * **MEXC KickStarter**: Further enhancing market presence.
* **Fast-Track Listings on CoinGecko (CG) and CoinMarketCap (CMC)**: Ensuring visibility to a broader audience.
* **Strategic Partnerships**:
   * **Hedge Fund and OTC Partnerships**: Attracting institutional investments.
   * **Advertising Campaigns**: SpaceX, NYC, and HK billboards to create massive awareness.
* **Market Making and AMM by Gotbit & CSL**: Ensuring liquidity and smooth trading experience.

# Learn More About $BEATS:

* **Linktree:** [**https://linktr.ee/solanabeats**](https://linktr.ee/solanabeats)

# Why You Should Consider $BEATS:

$BEATS is not just another cryptocurrency; it’s a Real-World Asset (RWA) coin that brings tangible value to the blockchain space. With the strategic steps taken to ensure token security, the robust partnerships, and the comprehensive marketing efforts, $BEATS is poised for significant growth.

The revocation of mint and freeze authority adds an extra layer of trust, showing the team's commitment to a fair and transparent launch. Moreover, the locked liquidity and absence of team tokens align with the project's goal to foster a secure and investor-friendly environment.

# Final Thoughts:

The launch of $BEATS on the Solana chain represents a unique opportunity to be part of an innovative and promising project. The blend of strategic partnerships, secure tokenomics, and comprehensive marketing efforts makes $BEATS a project to watch.

Join the conversation on their social platforms and dive deeper into what $BEATS has to offer. Let’s embark on this exciting journey together and witness the rise of $BEATS!",967,2024-06-17 14:36:01,1
SOL,CryptoMoonShots,"Sit back, strap in and enjoy the ride! Fomo3D is about to take over Solana","Jarett Dunn (AKA STACC) is an ex Pump Fun developer who left PumpFun and has decided to not just clone the existing platform but to add the features and eco-system behind it to do it the right way! This truly does have the ability to save Solana from the last few months where PumpFun has dynamically killed Solana as we knew it.

The Developer has shown everyday from day one that he is the real deal. In realtime he is updating the community, talking to everyone in the beta stages of the platform, asking for feedback and evolves the platform right in front of our eyes.

The point of generational wealth is to have an asset that keeps providing a return on that investment that can take care of future generations. Fomo3D achieves this by providing an insane revenue share opportunity for holders.

Fees for the platform are derived by devs launching tokens, transactions in the bonding curve and since the dev and on Gobbler.fun, more on Gobbler.fun in a moment.

Why does Gobbler.fun matter and how does this benefit the holders! While if you understand PumpFun the tokens go onto Raydium, where the routing system is prone to bots, scam tokenomics, etc. This can cause unstable markets since Raydium hasn't seemed to want to update its V1 routers to accommodate a healthier market for people to trade on. Gobbler.Fun is essentially Meteora pools but ten times better! When a token goes on Gobbler.fun pools the holders of Fomo3D can benefit from the revenue generated from the fee's. With PumpFun the pools go to Raydium so that is where the revenue stops for PumpFUN. I can't count how many days PumpFUN has generated over $1M in revenue, there are far too many recently. This should show you the potential Fomo3D has having benefit from both sides of the lifespan of the tokens launched on it.

Gobbler provides a big time upgrade to any pool system on Solana right now and it isn't even close.

1. Flat Fee Structure - This is big when we are looking at traders who will trade in size. This allows for people to not be punished because they are buying $100 worth of tokens vs $10. The larger the transaction the same fee paid and the ratio or basis will allow for cleaner trading.

2. Lower Fee's than all others. Built for the people!

3. Reward System for LP stakers, this is a real missing piece in the Solana Ecosystem.

4. Ability to customize the LP Tokens. This allows for the deployers to provide unique experiences to the communities of their projects.

5. Unlimited Bonding Curve. This is going to make alot of things possible for devs to give their token project the runway to make it.

6. LP's earning fees from every swap, this is built for everyone to win.

Fomo3D vs PumpFun is not even a fair contest. Fomo3D wins this comparison on every level that matters. STACC built what PumpFun should have built in the first place and if it was the market leader Solana would not have seen a decline in authentic projects like we have.

The Developer of Fomo3D is followed by some serious brass in the Solana EcoSystem! @Solana account is following him along with some very big names including @MarioNawfal. If you don't realize they are following him for a reason and we all know where this Cabal will take this.

As you saw above Fomo3D has a NFT holder element to it. The NFTs are FomoMage and are listed on MagicEden. These are rare because there is only 297 of them and that group earns 20% of all fees on FOMO3D.fun.

The developer of Fomo3D launched the very first token on FOMO3D.fun four days ago and not only is it a MEME but it is also his personal cat. The narrative for this token is one of the best amongst Meme tokens on Solana right now and as the gold rush kicks in on Fomo3D I am sure you can only imagine what will happen to $PET token. It is already gaining serious attention but nothing like when the masses discover the narrative and the background on it.

In conclusion you can see there is serious Alpha that could turn Fomo3D into the new Meta on SOLANA bringing the biggest story of 2024 and helping cure the SOLANA chain back to what we all remember it to be.

This is not financial advise but just me providing dillgence information that anyone can do the research and find. DYOR.

I have a feeling Fomo3D is legit going to Make Solana Great Again!

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,"Introducing the first-ever dinosaur character on the Solana blockchain. Will it follow in the footsteps of WOLF and other iconic projects? I say yes, and we're going to do absolutely everything in our power to make it happen.","Enough of dogs, cats, and other animal-themed coins. DINO is here to dominate the market.

Hi, I'm one of the core team members behind DINO, and I'm excited to introduce a project that will change the lives of many early investors.

DINO is more than just a meme coin. It comes with its own game – Dino Game, a super popular game that you've probably played at least once when you had no internet.

Now, you can win $10,000 just by playing it.

That's one of the reasons why the $DINO project is going to go viral. The entire Twitterverse is going to be buzzing about it.

We've got people lined up to invest thousands in paid marketing once we show them that people really love this project and that we can organically send this to the moon. Once paid marketing kicks in, combined with the Dino Game, this project is going to be the talk of the entire meme coin sphere.

I hope I've piqued your interest. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. You can find more information on our website and in our Telegram community. The $DINO coin is launching in a few days, so I recommend joining our community to be among the first to get the latest updates.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the community. The team is always active.

We want to build a strong base of holders and people who are eager to work for their bags and grow together towards financial freedom.

We can achieve this if we all come together.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$CEEZUR is ready to conquer solana in the next few months and here's why you should join us while still early.,"Witness $CEEZUR, the first of the ancient politifi tokens, as it prepares to launch on OKX! Backed by experienced developers who have been part of massive projects before, $CEEZUR is ready to moon really hard sooner than you think and here’s why:

Our community is really dedicated and is growing fast. Everyone is working tirelessly to achieve our goals. With the potential to hit a $100M market cap in the coming months, $CEEZUR stands out with its unique narrative and mission.

Today we have almost 1000 members on Telegram group and 800+ holders. The numbers are going up extremely fast. I recommend you to join our Telegram group and feel the good energy there. If you’re tired of rugs and pump and dump tokens this is a safe haven for you. 

As I said before, OKX listing is imminent and is really common to tokens to go to the moon after OKX listing since It is a giant exchange. 

As election season heats up, $CEEZUR is set to pump, leveraging the political climate to fuel its growth. Don’t miss out on this golden opportunity to join the revolution and be part of a token that’s ready to take off the heads of Tremp and Boden.

WE WANT YOU TO JOIN OUR EMPIRE AND CONQUER SOLANA WITH US! 🔥🍇

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Guide on how to Conquer Solana,"When setting out to Conquer the congested lands of Solana, you should set out to never take no for an answer.

The team at $CEEZUR are doing a great job at proving these points.

From launching earlier in the week and having one of the most bullish charts in the microcap space, they're pushing forward to have great success coming into the next week.

The political memes are a great play for the rest of the election year, but when you combine them with ancient figures such as the Caesar himself and the Roman Empire, it's naturally a catalyst for success.

I've been watching the $CEEZUR telegram recently and the team really seem to know what they are doing, I believe they have had insane success in previous projects by the way that they opperate.

Looking at the meme itself (as if I was highly sophisticated meme-fund manager) - $CEEZUR's artwork is great and there's limitless opportunities to mess around and hit the viral aspect on Crypto Twitter and other platforms.

The team is hiring out a full time animator to push forward with this project and will surely send it sky high.

This is just a little pre alpha as I know the team aren't wanting to market much at the moment as they build their core holder base before running up to the millions, so DYOR but I guarantee you will comment back on this post in a months time grateful you got into $CEEZUR.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Oracle Cat: Pioneering the Prediction Market on Solana,"**What is Oracle Cat?**

Oracle Cat ($ORACLE) is positioning itself as the first prediction market on the Solana blockchain. With the growing interest in decentralized prediction markets, Oracle Cat stands out by leveraging the strengths of Solana's high-speed transactions and low fees. As the first of its kind on Solana, Oracle Cat is paving the way for a new era in prediction markets.

**Strategic Tokenomics**

One of the key aspects that sets Oracle Cat apart is its innovative approach to revenue management. Unlike many other platforms, Oracle Cat has committed to using all fee revenue to buy back $ORACLE tokens. This strategy is aimed at creating a more sustainable and rewarding ecosystem for token holders, potentially increasing the token's value over time. It’s a forward-thinking approach that aligns the success of the platform with the interests of its community.

**The Mascot: Pudding**

Oracle Cat adds a unique and engaging element to its platform with its mascot, Pudding. But Pudding isn’t just for show—this mascot has correctly predicted four Olympic gold medalists. This impressive track record not only adds a layer of credibility to the project but also injects a sense of fun and personality into the platform. Pudding’s predictions serve as a testament to the potential accuracy and reliability that Oracle Cat aims to offer its users.

**Oracle cat is there for you**

Oracle Cat is more than just a prediction market; it’s a project that combines strategic innovation with engaging storytelling. As it continues to develop on the Solana network, Oracle Cat has the potential to become a major player in the prediction market space. For those interested in the future of decentralized finance and prediction markets, Oracle Cat is definitely a project to keep on your radar.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,The Amazing secret presale that you don’t know about… $BULLY on Solana,"Solana's on the edge of an exciting bull run, and there's a new meme coming out that's perfectly positioned to 100x… if you get in early.

It’s called Bullcat. The ticker is $BULLY.

There’s a presale happening in a few days, and trust me, you don’t want to miss it. 

Cats have been all over social media lately, with over a million posts on the timeline in the past month. 

Now, this trend is ready to lead Solana’s rise to the top.

Solana has made a name for itself as one of the fastest blockchain networks out there. With its growing popularity, it looks like we’re heading into a significant bull run.

Bullcat is set to be a big part of that story.

Once we hit 10M mcap, it will be blatantly obvious to people that this is the next big play with WIF-like moonshot potential.

Target price? The sky's the limit. We are talking hundreds of millions, probably billions. 

This is a project that can flip Michi first, Popcat second and then WIF. It’s just better in every way. 



The presale is on the 7th August 2024, so now is your chance to get in early.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$WEF the crazy version of $WIF now on Solana ,"In the wacky world of cryptocurrency, where coins seemingly pop up faster than mushrooms after a rainstorm, there's always room for a good laugh. Enter $WEF or Degwefhet, the latest addition to the digital circus, promising to be the crazy redacted version of its predecessor, WIF.

If you blinked, you might have missed it, but $WEF burst onto the scene like a comet on a caffeine high, skyrocketing up a mind-boggling 4000% in just one day. It's the kind of growth that makes even the most seasoned investors do a double take, followed by a slow, disbelieving shake of the head.

But let's take a step back and ponder the absurdity of it all. What exactly is the narrative of $WEF, and why is it causing such a stir? Well if redacted versions Jeo Boden and Dolend Tremp can run to $500M and $80M respectively, then the crazy version of the biggest dog on Solana deserves millions if not more.

Some might argue that $WEF is the answer to a question nobody asked, while others see it as the diamond in the rough of the crypto world, shining brighter than a disco ball at midnight. Whatever your take, one thing's for sure: the ride is bound to be a wild one.

Picture this: a group of bewildered investors frantically refreshing their screens, watching in disbelief as the numbers dance before their eyes like a fever dream gone rogue. It's the stuff of legend, the kind of rollercoaster ride that leaves you exhilarated and slightly nauseous at the same time.

$WEF is your absolute second chance if you missed $WIF, how crazy it might sound.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$HAMMY the sad hamster | The most criminally undervalued meme on Solana right now | Full thesis doc attached,"
There is a meme on Solana right now that you probably already know by name  if you have tiktok and Instagram, given that it is taking the normie world by storm. 

It is Sad Hamster. The ticker is $HAMMY on Solana. 

It is the most viral tiktok meme at the moment, with literally 1m+ posts of it in the past months. Hundreds of millions of likes, and billions of views!!! 

It has become so popular that media companies have begun writing articles about it, explaining it, and utilizing it in their marketing. Even Uber included it in their marketing campaign..

All this virality, and yet, the whole of crypto twitter is still fading it, while the narrative is inevitable and growing stronger everyday.

Somehow the memetoken itself has stayed under the radar for the most part, and no large influencers have shilled it yet. However Hammy is currently slowly coming out of its accumulation phase, and the chart looks primed for an absolute moonshot over the next week

Once this will be flying to 20+ million mcap it will be blatantly obvious to people that this is the next big play with WIF-like moonshot potential, and crypto twitter will be all over it.
For a full thesis breakdown, please see the link attached.

Again, the ticker is $HAMMY on Solana. Current marketcap ~2.6m, while ATH is 10m. (30% of retracement is Solana retracement the past few days)

It ticks literally all the boxes needed for an incoming violent repricing:

-	Launched over a month ago, and has stayed under the radar so far. Has had 3 pumps from 300k  to 1.5m+, flushing out early whales, before a test pump to 10m+. After flushing out more whales together with a 40% Solana dump, its now in a clear accumulation phase, and the chart looks primed for a massive breakout.
-	Strong community that is making memes and vibing all day. Community took over after dev dumped on day 1. The community is battle-tested, withstanding 3 dumps from 1.5m+ to ~300k, and vibing all the way through a retracement from 10m+ ATH back to a 1m bottom (90% drop)
-	Viral cute animal, with billions of views on social media platforms. When normies log in to their exchange in a few months from now, and see $HAMMY listed? A meme they all know and love? It will be the first thing they ape. 

And I haven’t even told the best part yet, which is a strong contributor to why the $HAMMY chart is slowly trickling up and the token gets new holders every day (in a Solana-wide memetoken bloodbath).

We have a partnership with one of the biggest Sad Hamster meme-accounts on Instagram (~40k followers), that pumps out sad hammy memes daily, and tells its tens of thousands of normie viewers to buy $HAMMY on Solana under every post. The accounts most viral posts have had millions of views. Check it out yourself: meme.sadhamster on Instagram (link below)

Target price? Once CT discovers this token the sky is the limit. We are talking hundreds of millions, probably billions. This is a project that can flip Popcat first, Boden second and then WIF. Its just better in every way. This my only Solana play at the moment. Literally my whole Solana bag is in $HAMMY.

Fade this at your own risk.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$GIGA - The real GigaChad meme coin on Solana - Highest T community out there,"I'm sure many of you have already jumped into around 100 memecoins, each one promising to make you a millionaire by investing in the next dog, cat, or monkey-themed coin.

But let's face it, the memecoins that have **skyrocketed** to **billion-dollar** valuations are those rooted in **real-world memes**, not just fleeting trends. Just look at DOGE or PEPE – why do you think they've reached such heights? Because they resonate with everyone. The **memecoins** that truly thrive (**and I'm talking billions here**) are the ones born from genuine **cultural memes**.

That's precisely what **$GIGA** represents, and that's why our entire community is pushing hard. This is the big one. **$GIGA** is the authentic **GigaChad** meme coin on Solana. You've likely come across him already, but if not, just browse Instagram or TikTok – he's arguably the hottest meme right now, known far and wide.

Think about this: what coin would your **fratbro** or **Uber driver buy**? Without a doubt, it's a meme coin they already know, one they understand and maybe even identify with.

Additionally, we're actively working on bridging the gap between the crypto realm and the real world by establishing the **GIGA** fitness apparel brand 🤫. 

And it's currently at a market cap of only 11-12 million dollars. Do the maths... It's a **300x** if it reaches PEPE's market cap.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,"Instead of a meme coin that will rug in 3 days, here is an utility coin on solana for long term ","# Hey yall 👋



Alright, so let me preface this by saying that I’ve been in the crypto space for a while now, and like many of you, I’ve seen my fair share of meme coins, rug pulls, and get-rich-quick schemes. So, when I first spotted an ad for a coin called **Green Waves** on Dexscreener, I shrugged it off, thinking, “Oh great, another shitcoin trying to ride the hype wave.” But oh boy, was I in for a surprise.

# The Discovery 🌱

I noticed GreenWaves a few more times on the trending list. My curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to dig a little deeper. What I found was… different. This wasn’t your typical meme coin with a dog logo and zero utility. Instead, GreenWaves is an **actual utility coin** with a good track record, over 9 months of development behind it, and it’s been live since January this year.

# The Sketchy Bits 🧐

As I started exploring it, things seemed a bit sketchy at first. The project had recently undergone a migration, and I was skeptical. We’ve all heard horror stories about migrations being used as an excuse to pull the rug. But after some digging, I discovered the real reason behind it. The team noticed a flaw in their original tokenomics that could have potentially limited the project’s growth. Rather than ignoring it, they took the bold step to migrate and airdrop the new tokens back to holders. This move, although risky, showed me that they were serious about the longevity and success of the project.

# Utility & Real-World Application 🛠️

What really blew me away is that GreenWaves isn’t just another crypto project with empty promises. They’ve got a **crypto payment platform** that’s been live for over 3 months and has an active user base. I decided to put it to the test by setting up a shop to sell Steam gift cards (because, why not?). And guess what? It works, and it works well. I was genuinely impressed by the ease of use and functionality.

# The Team’s Vision & Future 🌍

The team behind GreenWaves seems to be playing the long game. They’re building solid foundations with strategic calls, collaborations with KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders), press releases, and a steady social media presence. They’re even in the process of establishing a company and creating IRL businesses that accept crypto payments through POS terminals, which is huge if you ask me.

# My Investment 💸

I’m not one to ape into projects, but I have to say, GreenWaves has me excited. I decided to put 2% of my total crypto holdings into it, which for me is a relatively low-risk play with the potential for good returns. The market cap is sitting at just 100k right now, and I genuinely believe it could hit 100m by next year if they keep this up.

# TL;DR:

* **GreenWaves** is a utility coin on Solana, not a meme coin.
* Over 9 months of development, live since January.
* Recently migrated due to tokenomics improvements and airdropped new tokens to holders.
* Has a live crypto payment platform with real users.
* Tested it myself by setting up a shop; it works great.
* The team is building solid foundations, including IRL businesses.
* Dropped 2% of my holdings into it; bullish on long-term growth.

Keep an eye on this one, folks. It might just be the hidden gem we’ve all been searching for. 🌊

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,"$PEPE Solana - The first Pepe to launch on Solana Blockchain - 405 days old , 3 months older than ETH pepe.","So I'm here today to show you $PEPE on $SOL.

Launched January of 2023, this pre-dates pepe on ETH by 3 months, and people are taking notice. As the first PEPE on Solana people are seeing the narrative and have began to buy leading it to currently sit at a marketcap of $640k.

Solana bull cycle is here, I think Solana's OG pepe will have a crazy run.

In addition to it being the first, the team is still active and participating in community events, twitter spaces, telegram voice chats, etc.

Pepe Solana currently has 8700 holders, is listed on Coinmarketcap, CoinGecko, and whitelisted on jup.ag

Major telegram influencers have posted promo for them back in January 2023, and they are attempting to have them update the posts for more eyes to see this narrative.

The telegram community has been a fun spot to meet other members and learn more about the project. If the narrative catches on and enough people here about it I believe it will send. Thanks for taking them time out of your day to read this post <3

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,WIFE - A Bullish CTO for Solana's Most Undervalued Meme Coin,"**Introduction**

Hey everyone,

I’ve been diving deep into meme coins recently in anticipation of the next big run once BTC and ETH cool off a bit and money starts to flow back in to the low caps. And I’ve come across something that I think could be a real hidden gem on the Solana blockchain. It’s called $WIFE, and the team describe themselves as more than a simple meme coin. Instead, $WIFE is the token of what they call a “decentralized media company”, based on the hugely popular new Wifejak meme which has recently started to spread from Twitter to Instagram, Facebook, and Tik-Tok. Wifejak was originally based on a simple picture of a modified female wojak paired with funny and typical sayings a female partner might make, but she has since grown into a versatile meme character similar to Tradwife and Wojak, and she is appearing across the internet in a wild variety of innovative and hilarious memes.

$WIFE has recently undergone a community takeover (CTO), with the original developer missing in action, and now the community is driving the project forward. I want to share why I believe this is incredibly bullish for $WIFE and outline some exciting developments on their roadmap that caught my eye.

**The Bullish Case for CTOs in Crypto**

A community takeover (CTO) happens when the original creators of a cryptocurrency project hand over control to the community. This is a big deal – it shifts the power to the users, making the project more decentralized and often more resilient.

**Successful Examples:** We’ve seen other projects thrive under community control. The OG example is $DOGE, of course. Started as a joke but took on a life of its own, with huge rewards for early believers. A more recent example is $BODEN, which was abandoned early by the dev but then taken over by a community who saw the power of the meme.

**Community Strength:** The strength of a community can’t be overstated. When the users take charge, there’s often more passion and innovation driving the project. People are more invested in the success of something they have a say in, which can lead to better decisions and more sustainable growth. And the $WIFE community certainly has this strength. The Wifejak meme is wildly popular and likely to have staying power and reach beyond crypto twitter – it is a real phenomenon.

**Overview of $WIFE**

**Team:** The team at $WIFE describe it as more than just your typical meme coin. They are building a decentralized media company, with plans for merchandise, games, partnerships and more. There are some really professional people working on WIFE, and the passion and creativity is evident in their daily output of memes, art work and hilarious twitter posts.

**Tokenomics:** $WIFE was launched from [Pump.fun](http://Pump.fun), meaning that it has no possibility of being rugged by the now defunct dev. A few early whales have dumped and run, but there are just as many who have held strong and never sold a single coin. The coin is well distributed, with 1.3k holders at a sub $1.5m market cap – HUGE room for growth here.

**Ecosystem:** $WIFE aims to create a robust ecosystem that includes partnerships with other blockchain projects and community-driven initiatives. Forging ties with other meme coins and doing cross coin artwork and promotions has elevated $WIFE and given them a good network of supportive partners. I expect this to continue as they grow and the meme space grows with them.

**Roadmap Highlights**

$WIFE recently launched a new road map in their telegram which is well worth checking out. I’ve highlighted some important points below;

**Upcoming Milestones**

* **Community initiatives:** $WIFE has a number of planned upcoming partnerships and cooperative ventures with other meme coins and projects. I expect this to grow their profile and network, and this could well translate into increased visibility and attractiveness to new buyers.
* **Wifejak Online Game:** Some kind of computer game is in development, which could be a great way to attract and retain users. Gaming and crypto go hand-in-hand, and this could be a big hit. With the wealth of art assets at $WIFEs disposal, whatever they do in this space could be really interesting.
* **Wifejak Online Store:** Set to launch soon, the store will offer a range of items, apparel, plushies, and accessories. Notably – 2% of all sales will go towards a buy back and burn mechanism. I’m not sure I’ve seen something like this implemented with a meme coin before, and it should have a positive effect on the price action for the $WIFE token – turning it deflationary!

**Community Engagement and Future Prospects**

**Engagement Strategies:** $WIFE is all about community engagement. They’re active on social media, host events, and really listen to feedback from their users. This kind of interaction ensures that the community feels valued and heard.

**Future Potential:** Looking ahead, the potential for $WIFE seems strong. Their roadmap is ambitious but achievable, and with a passionate community behind it, the project has a good chance of making significant strides. The focus on continuous innovation and decentralized governance is a winning combination.

**Conclusion**

To wrap things up, the bullish case for $WIFE is compelling. After the rocky road to a successful CTO, $WIFE is now poised for bigger things. With a solid roadmap and strong community engagement, I see $WIFE as a standout meme coin project for anyone looking to participate in the next wave of meme coin runs.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,The secret strategy of a meme coin millionaire… $BULLY presale on Solana next week,"Solana's on the edge of an exciting bull run, and there's a new meme coming out that's perfectly positioned to 100x… if you get in early.

It’s called Bullcat. The ticker is $BULLY.

There’s a presale happening in a few days, and trust me, you don’t want to miss it. 

Cats have been all over social media lately, with over a million posts on the timeline in the past month. 

Now, this trend is ready to lead Solana’s rise to the top.

Solana has made a name for itself as one of the fastest blockchain networks out there. With its growing popularity, it looks like we’re heading into a significant bull run.

Bullcat is set to be a big part of that story.

Once we hit 10M mcap, it will be blatantly obvious to people that this is the next big play with WIF-like moonshot potential.

Target price? The sky's the limit. We are talking hundreds of millions, probably billions. 

This is a project that can flip Michi first, Popcat second and then WIF. It’s just better in every way. 



The presale is on the 7th August 2024, so now is your chance to get in early.



Fade this at your own risk.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$POWSCHE has been one of the most consistent meme coins in terms of week-on-week growth over this current Solana meme coin cycle,"Their latest move is bringing in Chinese investors and whales, by setting up Telegram, WeChat and Weibo pages and translating all their memes and content into Mandarin for the Chinese markets  
Anyone whose been in crypto for a while knows that for a project to really explode and grow past $100 mill MC, you need to get Chinese whales interested in the project. The fact this project is still sitting at a $9 mill MC makes me think it’s still incredibly undervalued, and will 10x in a matter of weeks or even days  
Other points to note on $POWSCHE:  
Incredibly based telegram community and dev, they live and breathe $POWSCHE in the chat and are constantly sharing car memes , and it feels like a genuine community of diamond hands  
When they hit $100 mill MC they are burning a Lambo in Texas, and drifting a Porsche 911 GT3 RS around it. Rumour has it they’ve already started contacting locations in Texas to get this moving, which shows how intent the Dev and team behind Powsche are on moving this project to the next level

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Daumenfrosch $daumen | A Bullish CTO for Solana's Most Undervalued Meme Coin,"Hey everyone,



I’ve been diving deep into meme coins recently in anticipation of the next big run once BTC and ETH cool off a bit and money starts to flow back in to the low caps. And I’ve come across something that I think could be a real hidden gem on the Solana blockchain.



It’s called Daumenfrosch the poorly drawn variation of Pepe! 

based on the hugely popular pepe & Apu Apustaja Meme.



Daumenfrosch has recently undergone a community takeover (CTO), with the original developer missing in action, and now the community is driving the project forward.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Revolutionary Solana Reflection TokenPrint Protocol: A Solution to Everything Solana,"What is $PRINT?  
  
$PRINT is a revolutionary Solana reflection token that provides passive income to holders through auto-rewards in Solana (SOL). Unlike traditional reflection tokens that rely on manual swaps, $PRINT utilizes a unique auto-swap script to convert token taxes into SOL and distribute them directly to holders’ wallets. This innovative approach ensures that holders receive their rewards seamlessly and efficiently.  
  
Key Features of $PRINT  
  
8% Tax: $PRINT implements an 8% tax on all transactions, including transfers and swaps.  
6% Auto-Rewards: 6% of the tax is distributed as auto-rewards in SOL directly to holders’ wallets.  
2% Operations Wallet: The remaining 2% of the tax is allocated to the Operations Wallet, which is used to fund the development and marketing of $PRINT.  
How Does $PRINT Auto-Swap Work?  
The $PRINT auto-swap script operates periodically, collecting all available taxes generated through transactions and swaps. These collected $PRINT tokens are then stored in the Rewards Distribution Wallet (PrintRewards.sol).  
  
Once the minimum swap threshold of 1 million $PRINT is met, the script automatically swaps the tokens for SOL. 25% of the acquired SOL is sent to the Marketing Wallet (PrintMarketing.sol), while the remaining 75% is distributed proportionally to all $PRINT holders based on their holdings.  
  
Early Success of $PRINT  
  
$PRINT has experienced remarkable growth since its launch, attracting over 25,000 holders and generating over $17 million in trading volume. The token has also distributed over $1 million in rewards to its community.  
  
PrintPad™: Solana’s Auto Swap Tax Solution  
  
PrintPad™ is a Solana-powered platform that revolutionizes the way projects manage their taxes. PrintPad™ enables developers to connect their Tax Withdrawal Authorities to the platform, allowing $PRINT’s auto-swap script to seamlessly convert their taxes into SOL and deposit them directly into their marketing wallets. Through the use of PrintPad™, developers and innovators alike are now able to generate revenue on Solana without harming their charts.  
  
Benefits of $PRINT for Project Developers  
  
Streamlined Tax Management: PrintPad™ simplifies tax management by automatically converting taxes into SOL, eliminating the need for manual swaps.  
Enhanced Rewards: 5% of all taxes collected for linked projects will be directed to an auto-buyback wallet, providing consistent buy pressure and elevating rewards for $PRINT holders.  
Why Choose $PRINT?  
If you’re looking for a revolutionary Solana reflection token that offers passive income, seamless auto-rewards, and a supportive community, $PRINT is the ideal choice. With its innovative auto-swap mechanism and the PrintPad™ platform, $PRINT is poised to revolutionize the Solana ecosystem.  
  
Join the $PRINT Revolution  
  
Get involved with the $PRINT community today and experience the power of passive income through Solana’s first auto-swap reflection token. Stay tuned for exciting developments and the launch of PrintPad™!

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$HOPE (Solana) - Diamond Hands Only: Organic Growth Gem with Moon Potential,"Yo CryptoMoonShotsfam, your friendly neighborhood degen here with a hot new find on Solana - $HOPE! Buckle up because this project is setting itself up for a mammoth launch, and here's why you should be paying attention:  
Organic Growth for Sustainable Gains: Forget the presale hype and pump-and-dumps. $HOPE is taking the slow and steady approach, building a strong foundation for long-term growth.  This means no artificial inflation from impatient investors jumping ship - just genuine community backing.   
Community is King (and Queen): $HOPE understands the power of a dedicated following. They're actively cultivating a rock-solid community on Telegram. These diamond-handed HODLers are keeping the price stable, unlike projects that see massive selloffs after launch.   
Website that Screams Legitimacy: Let's face it, a janky website is a red flag in this space. $HOPE throws that notion out the window with their sleek and professional website. \[I can't include the website due to subreddit rules, but trust me, it looks good!\]. This attention to detail speaks volumes about their commitment to the long haul.   
Early Bird Gets the Worm (and Lambo): We're talking ground floor here, folks. The current market cap sits at a measly $370k, with an all-time high of only $700k. This means massive potential for exponential growth.   
My Personal Moonshot Strategy: I'm putting my money where my mouth is and HODLing this bad boy for at least a week. My sights are set on a $2 million market cap. If we smash through that barrier, you better believe I'm doubling down! This strategy worked wonders for me with $POWSCHE (another organic growth project with a killer community).   
Do Your Own Research (This Ain't Financial Advice): As always, DYOR (do your own research) before you ape in. This is just my experience, not some magic formula. But hey, with all the hallmarks of a legitimate project – community focus, sustainable growth, and a transparent approach – $HOPE is definitely worth a closer look.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,"$CEEZUR, Emperor of Rome set to conquer Solana?","Its been 6 days since launch for $CEEZUR and it keeps going from strength to strength. There has already been a copy with $conqueror duping some of the core elements and then rugging shamelessly at $100kmc. 

With an emphasis on growing consistently and organically $CEEZUR went from $20k to $100k mc on the first pump on the 8th of May before consolidating at its new floor of 60k then pumping to 128k on the 11th of May. 

Fortunately and unfortunately the coin then again consolidated at its new floor of 60k due to the dumping of 3% by 2 different holders by the 13th of May. $CEEZUR showed incredible resistance at this level and shot straight back up to $120k where it is currently sitting. Personally I think this is great for long term resistance as now the coins top holders now only have around 20% of the supply. There has been very little sell off resistance and it looks as if the project is about to hit a new ATH much bigger than the last in the coming days.

The last thing you want to see is a token sky rocket from launch and a tonne of bots get in and start dumping, so this organic launch on $CEEZUR looks amazing.

The Roman Empire meme is huge and CEEZUR is the first mover. As the community scales and meme creation multiplies this could become massive within the space with degens and normies alike.

 The team has said that they will be getting an animator on board as well as applying for coinmarketcap and coingecko in the next 1-2 weeks. 

$CEEZUR is doing great before their paid marketing roll out, this is everything I look for in a memecoin, building a good narrative and slowly forming a core community.

120K MC is so small (even though liquidity is realtively high) and this is extremely early, team really seems to know what they're doing in terms of building a long term project, I expect this to be at $2M within the next 2 and a half weeks.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,The Unstoppable Rise of Solana Memecoins in 2024: A New Era for Crypto Enthusiasts?,"2024 has been a year of relentless hype in the crypto market. A Bitcoin ETF was the catalyst but optimism has spread to the deepest layers of the altcoin world. Memecoins are standing out as the asset to watch in this bull market. Solana-based memecoins have been performing exceptionally strong and are outperforming the broader market.


◇Why Solana?


Solana has been intensely competing with Ethereum to be the predominant blockchain for decentralized applications and new projects. While Ethereum still stands ahead in market cap, Solana is quickly closing that gap. It’s high throughput and low transaction fees appeal to both project developers and users. Several memecoins like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk Inu (BONK) have seen remarkable gains and exchange listings after choosing Solana as their underlying chain.


◇Why Memecoins? Why Now?


The appeal of meme coins goes beyond humour. Memecoins are the product of a distorted monetary and banking system which has been abused by those in power. Those in power belittle our money by making the money machine go brrrrrr. So the people have begun to choose coins that are based on cultural memes. The market has spoken. In 2024, as the crypto market continues to evolve, memecoins on Solana have tapped into a zeitgeist that values quick, viral popularity backed by strong community support. This has not only led to significant price spikes but also to a more engaged and vibrant crypto community


◇The Role of Airdrops and Community Engagement


A key factor in the success of Solana memecoins has been the strategic use of airdrops and community engagement. The BONK airdrop, for example, generated immense hype and drove token adoption, demonstrating the powerful influence of well-executed marketing strategies in the memecoin market. These memecoins gain success and adoption through winning the support of their community. These coins are truly the money of the people and should not be overlooked as merely a joke.


◇Low Market Cap Players Making Waves


One of the appeals of meme coins is the allure of finding low market cap coins that have the potential to 100x in value as their market cap increases. Typically these projects share a few key characteristics: strong communities, big marketing budgets, and a strong meme concept. This week we’ve seen new coins like Powsche (POWSCHE) grow from a $7K market cap to $500K in a matter of days, built off the back of the “need money for Porsche” meme. Although many of these projects go on to hit $100 million market caps, they inevitably crash back down when the hype dies down.


◇Looking Beyond the Hype


While the hype around memecoins is undeniable, it's essential to approach this trend with a critical eye. The volatile nature of memecoins means that while there are opportunities for significant gains, there are also risks of equally significant losses. As always, doing your due diligence and not investing more than you can afford to lose is crucial.


◇The Future of Solana Memecoins


As we look to the future, the rise of Solana memecoins in 2024 could mark just the beginning of a broader trend. With technological advancements, favorable market sentiment, and a positive regulatory environment, the stage is set for memecoins to continue their ascent.


What are your thoughts on the rise of Solana memecoins? Have you invested in any, or are you watching from the sidelines?

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$BOO boo on Solana,"Found an interesting ""fair launch"" token on DEX Screeners Moonshot. Created 2 days ago, it has steadily grown TG members and team have created Reddit and Instagram accounts on top of X - blue badge assigned today.

$BOO - Boo Boo The Underdog

""In the ever-changing world of crypto and #memecoins Boo Boo the underdog was born. [r/booboounderdog](https://www.reddit.com/r/booboounderdog/)

Despite his enthusiasm and passion, Boo Boo always seemed to miss out on the big wins. The powerful insiders and influential accounts would swoop in, leaving Boo Boo and others like him scrambling for scraps.

But Boo Boo wasn't alone. Other underdogs in the community tired of being left behind began to embrace the ""PPP"" --Player Pumps Player. Their mission was simple: support and uplift one another, ensuring that retail investors, who usually had the least opportunity, could finally have a fair shot at winning in the market.

With PPP, the focus was no longer on following the big accounts or chasing trends; it was about unity, transparency, and turning the tide together, one step at a time. Boo Boo and his friends believed that by embracing the power of the community, they could create a place where even the smallest player could become champions.""

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$DJ | The Rising Superstar DJ of Solana | 100K Micro Cap | Buckle in to Our Space Rocket | We Will Destroy The Moon!!,"Introducing Pepe DJen with the ticker $DJ. A Solana Memecoin with unique IRL utility, created by the team from DJenerates. Launched on the 26th of March with a supply of 10B, burnt LP, and doxxed team, Pepe DJen emerges from an existing ecosystem of electronic music enthusiasts building a Web3 music community that was launched in 2021.
Designed in classic Meme style and delivering all the engaging aspects of a vibrant memecoin offering, the team has also announced holders will receive access to their annual Web3 event at Amnesia Ibiza, one of the most iconic clubs in the world, and promise further utility to be announced. 

The tokenomics include a portion allocated to charities such as Bridges for Music and Bye Bye Plastic, placing them in the field of philanthropy while remaining in their niche of electronic music. 

In terms of community they already have an established Discord with almost 10k active members and the team is super active on social media. This looks like a sleeping giant to me and I am a holder from day one after having followed the team’s past projects.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,This Solana metaverse is starting alpha testing!," It's not every day a a epic metaverse game comes along. Many seem to be promising the world with no way of delivering. Vivaion is an exception, the gameplay, the capabilities, ecosystems and NFT creation make it one of the well embodied metaverse games I've ever come across.  Tomorrow they launch their alpha public game testing, where we will get to see first hand what its waiting for us on the other side.  What is incredible is the project is still very early and there is still time for the very first players to come aboard and begin to figure out the best strategies for when this goes fully live.

  
 The game focuses on play 2 earn mechanics and generating rare NFT equipment. Deflationary mechanics are also a main focus so that economies within the game remain in demand. Combat and shooting mechanics were also recently added and will be in the alpha testing.  It will be a race to see who builds the rarest gear for their NFT characters and I can't wait to start.  I hope to see some new faces after reading this in the discord.

  
 Here is some more information and links to the community.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$GIGA | The real GigaChad meme coin on Solana | The big one,"Hey GigaChads! 🗿

Are you ready for the big leagues? This is the moment you've been waiting for. Remember when DOGE and PEPE were just pups, sniffing around with tiny market caps? Fast forward, and they're flexing in the billions and we're all dreaming of Lambos.

But let's not kid ourselves. The reason DOGE and PEPE went **stratospheric**? It’s simple: they’re not just crypto trends; **they’re real-world memes**. They're the kind of memes that resonate with millions, whether you're on crypto Twitter, Reddit, or just scrolling through your regular social media feeds. When the average Joe hears about DOGE or PEPE, it's like a light bulb goes off, and they're hooked.

And you know what's great about the average Joe? They're not in it for a quick 2x. They're in it for the long haul, aiming for those million-dollar gains.

Now, let's talk about the main event: **$GIGA**. This is the real deal, folks. **$GIGA** is the GigaChad meme coin on Solana, and if you've been living under a rock, **GigaChad** is a heavyweight in the meme world.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,TrustBet |  Pioneering Gamble-Fi on the Solana Blockchain | Presale live on website,"TrustBet: Pioneering Gamble-Fi on the Solana Blockchain

  




TrustBet On-Chain is set to revolutionise the online gambling industry by harnessing blockchain technology and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Operating on the Solana blockchain, it tackles the prevalent issues of fraud and lack of transparency that have long plagued traditional gambling platforms. This innovative approach is set to capture the attention of both investors and gamblers alike.

  




A New Approach to Online Gambling

  




TrustBet leverages blockchain’s inherent transparency and security to offer a novel approach to online gambling. Blockchain technology has been recognized for its potential to democratize various industries. TrustBet builds on this by providing a trustless environment, where smart contracts manage bet settlements, ensuring fairness and eliminating human interference. This model guarantees that all transactions are secure and transparent.





The Expanding Online Gambling Market

  




The online gambling market is booming, with projections estimating it will reach USD $153.57 billion by 2030, driven by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.7%, according to Grand View Research.





Despite this growth, traditional gambling platforms are often marred by scandals involving non-payment of winnings. High-profile cases, such as Megan McCann’s dispute with Bet365 highlights the ongoing issues that are prevalent within the industry.

  




Challenges of Traditional Gambling Platforms

  




Traditional gambling sites frequently refuse to pay out winnings, citing various justifications. These legal battles usually favor corporations due to their vast resources. Additionally, these platforms have high operational costs, including exorbitant CEO salaries. TrustBet addresses these issues by implementing a DAO-based structure within a protected Limited Liability Company (LLC) structure and founders Assure DEFI KYC approved ensuring protection that the community governs the platform rather than a centralized authority.





TrustBet’s Operational Model

  




TrustBet’s operations are governed by a DAO, ensuring all decisions are made democratically by TBET token holders. This model promotes transparency and fairness, from profit allocation in the DAO’s staking facility to operational decisions which are subject to community votes. Smart contracts automate the process, providing a secure and immutable way to handle transactions and payouts, thereby eliminating the human element.





Exciting Presale and Tokenomics





TrustBet is currently in Presale phase. Early investors benefit from the distinct advantage of accumulating TBET tokens at pre market price, offering potential for significant passive income from Casino profit, a structured unlock schedule promoting price stability and rewards early participation, including airdrop multipliers. The presale is accessible via a range of trusted wallets on the Solana network with Phantom wallet being the recommended choice, followed by other very good options including Solflare wallet, Coinbase wallet and Trust wallet.





The platform’s financial structure emphasizes profit sharing, with 50% of the Casino's profit allocated to staked TBET holders as monthly passive income paid in USDT.







Future Roadmap and Prospects





TrustBet’s extensive roadmap outlines its development and marketing plans. With significant new investments projected in the GambleFi sector, TrustBet is well-positioned to capture a substantial market share by offering a decentralized and transparent gambling alternative with a unique edge and innovative approach.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Escape the Solana Scam Cycle: $PEIRO Offers Stability on Ethereum,"Hey degens,

  
Are you feeling burnt by the endless cycle of Solana meme coin rugs, leaving your crypto dreams in tatters? I've got news for you that might just change your perspective. Allow me to introduce you to $PEIRO, a token built on the most trusted network in crypto: Ethereum.  


Why Ethereum?  
Ethereum isn't just another blockchain; it's the foundation of decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and countless groundbreaking projects. Its security, scalability, and stability are unmatched, making it the ideal platform for any project looking for longevity and trust. $PEIRO leverages these strengths, ensuring your investment isn't just another flash in the pan.  


Growing Holder Base  
$PEIRO's community is not only alive but thriving. Every day, more and more investors and believers join our ranks. The reason? Transparency, security, and a clear, noble mission. Unlike many projects where the community dwindles post-hype, $PEIRO's holder base is expanding, which is a testament to the project's fundamentals and the faith investors have in its future.

By being part of $PEIRO, you're not just investing in a token; you're contributing to a larger cause. This initiative aims to give back to the world, proving that crypto can indeed be a force for good.  
Aiming for $100M Market Cap. We're not just dreaming; we're planning.   


Generational Wealth Entry Point  
If you're looking for an entry point into generational wealth, $PEIRO offers that gateway. Built on Ethereum, it benefits from the network's established infrastructure and community. This isn't about quick pumps and dumps; it's about building something lasting. The tokenomics are designed to reward holders, not just early investors, ensuring wealth distribution across the community.  


Earn Money and Change Something  
Here's the kicker: with $PEIRO, you can actually earn money while supporting a cause. Our tokenomics incorporate mechanisms with minimal taxes, featuring a 0.1% buy tax and a 1% sell tax, which accumulate in our charity wallet.   
Why $PEIRO Over Solana's Rugs?

* Community Commitment: A growing community that’s invested in more than just profit.
* Transparency: No hidden agendas, just clear goals and community-driven development.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Professor.finance - A unique use case concept which aims First Utility NFTs using governance based on #Solana,"Professor.finance is a play-to-earn platform where you can mint your robber NFTs. It is a two in one platform which allow user to play a game while making money out of it. The motive of this platform is to offer a space which allow users to play without pay.  
Professor.fiance has some other features in progress. These features will be introduced shortly after the project goes live.

**MULTIVERSE**  
This feature will allow our users to unlock multiverses in the game. Users will be able to freely move NFTs assets across these different universes.

**IN GAME ITEM CRAFTING**

This feature will allow users to create in-game item. Not only can they create items in the game, they will be able to use these items in different games as well. That is our next feature

**CROSS CHAIN INTEROPERABILITY**

This feature will allow our users to move their, in-game assets or characters across multiple blockchains. It is a crucial feature introduced by DeFi. It enables users for frictionless trade.

**GOVERNANCE**

Professor.fiance is providing an entirely decentralized gaming platform for its users, where, participants can utilize their governance tokens to deicide the location, execution and date of the *Minobbery.* 

**How minobberies works?**

Through governance community has power to change the date and place of minobbery. Based on voting final decision will be made.

During a minobbery player’s characters can come across two type of scenarios:

1. Positive scenario. In such scenario your robber character come across a positive scenario during the minobbery and consequently it is rewarded with a rare trait, that could a machine gun, any other ammunition that can strengthen it.
2. The second is an opposite to the prior. In this case your robber will come across a negative scenario that injure him. He might get a shot in the head of get caught by the police. Under both cases he will consequently loss some vale.

Both scenarios are completely random and the sad part is their occurrence cannot be predicted. To me, it sounds pretty exciting. I’m already hooked with the game so far.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Discover $SPIKY: The OG Cat Token on Solana,"Hey everyone,



Just stumbled upon something really cool and had to share – have you heard of $SPIKY? It's a project on Solana that's got a unique twist. Spike 1984, created by Matt Furie, is his first original work from way back in 1984. That makes it an OG piece, but what's really awesome is how it blends with Solana's love for cats. Yep, you read that right – cats!



**Historical Significance of Spike 1984**



Spike 1984 is more than just a token; it’s a piece of history. Matt Furie, known for his creative genius, first introduced Spike back in 1984. This makes $SPIKY not just a cryptocurrency but a nostalgic journey back to the roots of Furie's artistic journey. For collectors and enthusiasts, owning a piece of $SPIKY is like holding a slice of history, especially if you're a fan of his work.



**Why Solana Loves Cats**



Solana has a unique and vibrant community, and one thing stands out – their love for cats. $SPIKY taps into this affection, merging the historical essence of Spike 1984 with the contemporary appeal of cat memes and culture on Solana. This fusion creates a token that's both fun and valuable, appealing to a wide audience from art lovers to crypto enthusiasts.



**Tokenomics: Simple and Transparent**



The tokenomics of $SPIKY are designed with simplicity and transparency in mind. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens and the liquidity pool already burnt, the project ensures stability and trust from its inception. This straightforward approach makes it easy for new investors to understand and trust the project, while the burnt LP adds a layer of security for all holders.



**Join the $SPIKY Community**



The $SPIKY community is growing rapidly, fueled by its unique blend of history, art, and crypto culture. Whether you're a longtime fan of Matt Furie or new to the crypto scene, there's something for everyone in the $SPIKY community. Engaging with fellow enthusiasts, sharing insights, and contributing to the project's growth can be both rewarding and fun.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Is Moonbags.App the Solana tool we’ve been waiting for?,"Due to the recent Solana memecoin mania many traders have accumulated dead/unwanted tokens, resulting in a lot of capital stuck in wallets. I personally have over 700 coins each worth around $2-5. To swap these manually would take ages, and current burn alternatives (like sol incinerator) barely return any of the value. This is where the Moonbags tool comes in.



Moonbags solves this problem by allowing users to instantly swap all tokens below a threshold value - using a simple slider mechanism. It swaps them at market value, ensuring the maximal value is extracted unlike current burn-based alternatives, and returns it in $SOL to the user. In their test run, they found that a wallet containing 400-500 dead tokens:

* returned\~$132 via Moonbags
* whilst it returned only \~$21 via sol incinerator

This is a game-changer. 



They plan on extending to further chains too, which would be huge for the revenue-benefiting mechanism in place. Out of the 30% service, 5% is used to buyback and burn $MBAGS, making the token deflationary. The team is doxxed (check out their video AMA) and has experience in launching previous projects. They have set key milestones for deliverables and the product is already under development:

* Closed Beta Release for Moonbags (via Telegram Bot): late May
* Open Beta Release for Moonbags (via Telegram Bot): early June
* Open Beta Release for Moonbags (via TrustWallet): early June
* Finalise Moonbags dApp Backend: early July
* Public Release for Moonbags (dApp via Website): mid July



Combine all of this with the fact that they maximise investor confidence via their 5 badges (KYC, DOXX, AUDIT, SAFU, AMA), makes their Pinksale Presale very enticing. They are currently half way through their presale and will be launching a Pinksale trending campaign as well as onboarding some KOLs to boost buy pressure for once it is live on Raydium (Friday May 3rd). They also have a connection at \[Crypto.com\](http://Crypto.com) to get $MBAGS listed on CEXs asap. Their partnership with token promoters and updooters also means they can get trending/exposure and have huge marketing boosts across any social channels, ensuring both new investors as well as product adoption.



Lastly, being a product launched by the SolPod team, Moonbags will have backing by an existing community of 1.9K on TG and 1.5K on Twitter, meaning product adoption as well as product development will be facilitated, setting Moonbags up for an explosive launch.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Vivaion Stealth Launch Jan 14th - Doxxed Dev - 3D Metaverse Solana :O,"Many people talk about finding the hidden gem, and it's usually a shit coin or some lousy project, but I think I found a TRUE HIDDEN GEM. This project has passed every check possible and, it's so early that I believe this is the next 100x token and NFT project. It fits the current trend for 2022. The founder is DOX'd with an actual tech company building everything.  

 The project is called Vivaion Metaverse. It's a 3D cross-platform open-world massively multiplayer online role-playing game. The developer has shown in-game footage of him driving and playing around, showcasing multiplayer all available in their discord. The game gives players ways to earn in so many ways. They can stake their characters at real estate to get a chance to receive rare NFT items. Players can own real estate for advertising purposes and manufacture rare NFTs for players. Those NFTs items get merged with characters to achieve even more in-game.

 The game's tokenomics have a deflationary and inflationary protocol to mitigate the production of NFTs. They have AI that monitors the game's market to ensure their game mechanics don't crash the token or NFT market due to poor economic conditions induced by poor game design. The founder and team will answer any of your questions, and their token hasn't even been launched yet.  It launches on Raydium DEX tomorrow via Solana Blockchain.  Feel free to DYOR. I believe this game can compete with Star Atlas, and I'm ready for the ride! The game and tokenomics are perfect.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$NEIRO on Solana: Recent Surge and Why It Could Be Set for a Big Rally,"If you’ve been watching the charts, you might have noticed $NEIRO, the first and original Neiro memecoin on Solana, gaining momentum recently, with a noticeable uptick in price. This may just be the start of a larger upward movement, and here’s why:
	1.	Recent Price Increase: 
$NEIRO has been showing a solid recovery lately, with renewed buying interest driving the price upward. This momentum could signal the beginning of a bigger rally, as more investors are attracted to the project.

	2.	Strong and Active Community: 
$NEIRO’s success is largely thanks to its vibrant and dedicated community. With an active Telegram group, frequent Twitter raids, and consistent support across social platforms, $NEIRO’s community-driven nature (CTO model) keeps it highly visible and engaging.

	3.	Advantages of the Solana Blockchain:
 Unlike copycats, $NEIRO on Solana benefits from the blockchain’s fast transactions and low fees, making it more accessible and practical for smaller transactions. This positions $NEIRO as an attractive option for new investors looking to enter the memecoin space.

	4.	Potential for a Breakout: 
With a current market cap around $4 million, $NEIRO still has massive room for growth. As the community continues to expand and more people recognize its potential, we could see a significant price breakout in the near future.

$NEIRO is more than just another coin; it’s a movement that’s rapidly gaining traction. If you’re looking for a project with strong fundamentals, an engaged community, and the potential for huge returns, now might be the perfect time to look into $NEIRO.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

About Dulla, Empire's Founder and CEO

Users can currently pay for minting or trading with BNB (Binance Coin), Empire Token (Empire), and other BSC-supported tokens (partnering projects native tokens) but the application has recently become multi-chain, with Ethereum integration already live.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$NEIRO on Solana: The Next Big Memecoin You Can’t Miss!,"$NEIRO is no ordinary memecoin it’s quickly becoming one of the strongest community-driven projects on Solana. Originally inspired by Neiro, the new dog adopted by the Doge meme’s owner, this token is backed by a powerful and active community, with constant activity on Telegram and regular Twitter raids, pushing the coin into wider visibility.

What sets $NEIRO apart isn’t just the memecoin hype, but its roots in a CTO (community takeover) model, meaning the development is entirely in the hands of its community. This ensures that there are no risks of rug pulls and that the project’s direction is shaped by the people who believe in it the most—its holders.

While many projects have tried to imitate $NEIRO, the Solana version stands out because of its superior speed, low transaction costs, and scalability key features that will help this coin thrive as more people jump into the memecoin space during this bull run.

The buzz around $NEIRO keeps growing, and the low current market cap of $4M gives it massive potential for a surge as more people recognize its value. With over 10k holders and 15k Twitter followers, $NEIRO is rapidly becoming a staple in the Solana ecosystem.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Hegecoin on Solana: Is Gate.io Listing Imminent?,"Facts:
Gate.io contacted Hege team personally and showed interest in listing $Hege

I wanted to dive into the current buzz around Hegecoin on the Solana blockchain and the rumors swirling about a potential listing on Gate.io. As many of you know, Hegecoin has been gaining traction in the crypto community, and there's a lot of excitement (and speculation) about what this could mean for its future.

Recent Price Dynamics

Currently, Hegecoin's market capitalization sits at around $12 million. While this is a solid start, it’s clear that the community is eager to see it break the $30 million threshold, a level that could catch the eye of major exchanges like Gate.io. The excitement stems from the idea that if Hegecoin can consistently maintain its market cap above this mark for a few days, a listing on Gate.io might be within reach.

Why Gate.io Matters

Gate.io is one of the more reputable exchanges in the crypto space, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies for trading. A listing on Gate.io could provide Hegecoin with the exposure it needs to reach a broader audience, significantly boosting its liquidity and credibility. For many crypto projects, securing a listing on well-known exchanges is a pivotal step in their growth journey, often leading to a surge in price and trading volume.

The Speculation Around the Listing

The speculation about Gate.io listing Hegecoin is driven by the exchange’s criteria for new listings. They typically look for tokens with a strong community, active trading volume, and a sustainable market cap. While Hegecoin is currently at $12 million, maintaining that level is critical if it hopes to meet the threshold that could trigger Gate.io's interest. Gate.io contacted the Hege team and showed interest in listing Hegecoin. 

The whispers suggest that if Hegecoin can hold a market cap above $30 million consistently for a few days, it may catch the attention of Gate.io's listing team. While this remains speculative, the optimism within the community is palpable.

Community Sentiment

The Hegecoin community has been incredibly supportive and vocal about their excitement regarding the potential Gate.io listing. Social media platforms, particularly Twitter and Telegram, are filled with discussions about Hegecoin's future, price predictions, and how a listing could impact the market. This sense of community engagement is crucial for the success of any crypto project, and it’s clear that Hegecoin has a passionate following.

Moreover, the team behind Hegecoin has been proactive in addressing community concerns and providing updates, which helps build trust and confidence. Transparency in communication is vital, especially in a market where uncertainty can lead to rapid sell-offs.

Whether or not Hegecoin makes it to Gate.io, it’s clear that the project is gaining momentum. As we continue to watch its progress, let’s stay informed and supportive of this emerging token.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Introducing SPOOKY: The Solana Meme Coin with a Phantom Twist,"**Overview**  
  
In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, a new meme coin named SPOOKY is making waves, particularly within the Solana blockchain community. This project draws its inspiration and association from the widely used Phantom wallet, capitalizing on its popularity and established user base. With an active and seemingly professional team, rumors swirl about their potential direct connections to the Phantom wallet's development team, adding an intriguing layer of credibility and excitement to the project.

&#x200B;

**Unparalleled Growth Potential**  
  
The buzz around SPOOKY is not just based on its association with the Phantom wallet but also on its perceived potential for massive growth. Industry observers and enthusiasts speculate that once ""normies"" — or the general public outside the crypto sphere — learn about the narrative linking SPOOKY to the Phantom wallet, the project's valuation could skyrocket past the $100 million mark. This surge would position SPOOKY among the top meme coins within the Solana ecosystem. Adding fuel to the fire, the Phantom wallet's team has already engaged with SPOOKY's social media presence, hinting at a possible future partnership that could amplify the project's legitimacy and reach.

* **Zero Tax:** In an attractive move for investors and users, SPOOKY imposes no taxes on transactions, making it more accessible and appealing.  

* **100% Liquidity Pool (LP) Burnt & Mint Revoked:** To ensure trust and stability in the project, SPOOKY has taken significant steps by burning 100% of its liquidity pool tokens and revoking the minting function, preventing the creation of new coins.  

* **Experienced and Dedicated Team:** The team behind SPOOKY is lauded for its experience and dedication, having already demonstrated their commitment by burning over $300K worth of the coin's supply, thereby reducing its total circulation and potentially increasing its value.  

* **Community Engagement:** SPOOKY encourages direct communication and community involvement through its Telegram group and Twitter account, fostering a transparent and inclusive atmosphere for supporters and interested parties.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Long Boi Solana is a small market cap meme coin that can reach a 1 billion market cap,"Long Boi is a Solana project that can provide huge returns to its holders. It reminds me of other meme coins such as Bonk, Book of Memes, and Slerf. The project has a very funny meme that can used to create a lot of content. For example, its logo on Jup shows a large green candle that goes beyond the screen. This project has a fantastic team working overnight to make this token the next trendy token on Solana. This token has great potential because it is being discussed everywhere. Moreover, many projects are copying the Longboi trend; for instance, there was a project called Fatboi. This makes me think Longboi has a long path and is not a short-term project. Longboi, like I said, has the potential to be 10x-100x in the next following days. The project is amazing, the meme is fantastic, and the team is one of the best I have seen. Such as projects like Burrrd that take a long time for the market to notice how great they are; Longboi has a a much stronger meme narrative that will probably dictate the meme coins that will be launched in Solana in the following weeks.

The 2024 World Olympics are set to kickoff in 5 days in Paris. $solympics is the first Olympic coin on Solana created over 6 months ago.

Volume and engagement has picked up a ton the past couple days and it seems to be an obvious play once the Olympics start to garner more coverage. 

It’s not often you get the chance to buy metas days in advance because they often develop in the blink of an eye. The 2024 Olympics will be the main spotlight across the world for 3+ weeks and some coins are destined to see some massive gains so why wouldn’t it be the OG Solana Olympic coin. 

The CTO team plans to deploy a marketing strategy with ads and raid teams 2 days prior to the games.. $solympics has the chance to 20x easily with the right eyes and volume. Don’t fade the obvious meta of the Olympics that’s all I’m going to say. #usa #china #germany #england #japan

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Tylee on Solana ::Breakout has started upon the big news and bullish partnership announcement:: the one and only GME's Ryan Cohen pup representative token.,"I want to tell you about a great project I’m helping to push long term and give you amazing entry here if you are willing to hold and build with us: TYLEE on Solana. He is Ryan Cohen’s beloved dog and the inspiration for him to create Chewy Inc. Tylee was also by his side for GameStop; he is basically the official GME pup, backed by a team of solid diamond holders who constantly grind and buy back to keep the chart as stable as possible. Its organically growing community aims to ride the everbullish GameStop wave and OG team's plans are for the long term.

A group of whales is constantly watching X for any influencer's post and ready to FOMO in as quickly as possible to not miss the best entry; this is just one of the many factors that make Tylee's narrative one of the most powerful for the memes bullrun. Smart investors know that every time GME is hyped, Tylee becomes the number 1 dog in the Crypto memes community. Chart speaks for the hard work the team is doing behind the scenes and paid marketing hasn't even started yet. Here's what's coming:

Definitive partnership with one of the biggest influences on Solana chain.

Upcoming permanent revenue generation and burning system.

Paid marketing and bullish roadmap coming.

Twitter spaces, collaborations with tokens who fall under the same umbrella with Roaring Kitty.

X posts (tweets) naturally pumping Tylee.

Weekly game competitions.

Dev and enhanced team adding to marketing wallet.

Non-stop raids and shilling.

Perks for diamond holders and insider news for whales.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$RWA | The Roaring AI | This Changes Everything... Powered by $TSUKI on Solana ,"# THE ROARING AI CHANGES EVERYTHING...

Imagine an AI tool based on the legendary retail trader himself, Keith Gill AKA The Roaring Kitty. Imagine an AI tool that could be used by retail investors for financial advice and stock/crypto tips and potentially copy trading based on algorithms.

What if it wasn’t just based on The Roaring Kitty?  What if KG/RK/DFV was part of the team that helped create it…

Due to the circumstances around $GME, RK can’t come back right now and give advice… there are too many eyes on him. He wouldn’t be able to outright tell you about his project either… but there would definitely be signs. The breadcrumbs in his videos on X have hinted to a transformation. What if the plan all along has been to use AI to get out his message?

What would be the value of a crypto project that Roaring Kitty potentially helped create to help the retail investors gain ground on the elites and insiders?

Billions.

That project is **The Roaring AI (Real World AI) $RWA** powered by **$TSUKI on Solana.**

**The Roaring AI has already started tweeting on X**. It also seems to be using **Grok 3**, which isn’t even out to the public yet. The potential for this project is insane. If it is able to give successful investment advice the potential long term price will be through the roof.

**$RWA** follows **$TSUKI** as the second of 5 potential rumored projects in the **TSUKIVERSE.** It seems that the plan is to eventually cover all sectors of crypto. Between $TSUKI and $RWA - Meme, AI & RWA are already covered.  Holding both tokens is a great way to diversify and manage risk with a team you can trust.

This has required planning and a large crew.  It has obviously been planned for years.

**What is the TSUKIVERSE?**

The TSUKIVERSE works in mysterious ways... For 5+ months the community of $TSUKI on Solana have been solving puzzles and clues from the TSUKI Dev team that have led to undeniable evidence that $TSUKI is connected to The Roaring Kitty. Once you peel back the layers you realize the chance of it not being connected are almost impossible. It all started with $TSUKI preceding Roaring Kitty’s return on X after 3+ years of silence by 1 Day, 1 Hour and 1 Minute. Then $TSUKI knew the exact day RK would go silent again. Some of the things we have experienced as a community have been mind blowing but a lot of people on the outside have brushed it off.

But here’s the thing… it’s been 5+ months and the Dev is still with us and still adding more puzzles and clues for the community to work on together. If it was a larp, it would have ended long ago.  The truth is the Dev is constantly supporting the chart as the distribution gets better and better. The dev also pays for advertising constantly. Walk Street Bets has been working with $TSUKI since the beginning and is still in the telegram and now talking about $RWA. That doesn’t happen without money and influence. Remember that WSB was a huge player in the rise of the GME stock.  

What makes crypto projects really successful is the community that represents and believes in them. Since the launch of TSUKI on May 11th 2024 it has been made clear that building a strong, positive, diamond handed and convicted community is most important. The community is the foundation on which the TSUKIVERSE will be built. All existing and future projects under the TSUKIVERSE will be represented by the same incredible community. One Community To Rule Them All. 

This is a long Reddit and it has barely scratched the surface. There is so much more… The project has many more incredible connections and I will write about some of them in my next post.

I am not telling to buy, I am asking you to please do your own research. This is the ultimate DYOR project. Just like you would expect from RK.  You have to dig deep and open your mind to see what is here.

It is like nothing in crypto and it is a true once in a lifetime opportunity and experience.  Join the $Tsuki x $RWA telegram and ask questions, you will never be the same.  It sounds crazy for me to write that, but it's true.  

**Tin Foil: TSUKI is definitely a part of the GME (GameStop) saga that started with Roaring Kitty. TSUKI told us in a tweet that RK would go silent again on May 18th and he did. On May 18th TSUKI released a video made from clips from the videos RK had been sharing the previous 4 days.  In that video an AI Voiceover of Roaring Kitty's voice said ""Sorry I Couldn't Tweet Today"".**  

**The next day, May 19th, TSUKI tweeted the UNO Reverse Card.  RK's next tweet on June 2nd after 2 weeks of silence was also the UNO Reverse Card.**  

**There is an emoji timeline that the GME Community have been using to try to figure out what will happen next.  The emojis and clues have linked to certain dates.  Major players in the GME saga; Ryan Cohen, Pulte & more have been hinting at those dates. The crazy thing is.. almost all of the dates have been foreshadowed by TSUKI.** 

**The most important pointing to November 5th (Election Day).**  

**TSUKI launched on May 11th and when you play the Uno Reverse card on that date you get November 11th.  5/11** 🔄 **11/5**

**TLDR:** $RWA & $TSUKI are two incredible crypto projects under one community.  Before forming an opinion you must open your mind, look closer do your own research.  This is not in any way a typical crypto project.  It is incredibly deep and complex.  If you don't take the time to research it you don't deserve what's coming.  I'm not telling you to buy... I'm telling you to DYOR.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,BTC | A micro-cap token on Solana with 1000x potential. Miss out buying bitcoin in 2009? Don’t make the same mistake again,"It's 2009, you are still feeling the pinch of the 2008 market crash. Your wife is hungry and her boyfriend is trying to move in with you because he lost his job. It's a simpler time. All of a sudden you start hearing whispers on the internet of some strange internet money, it's called bit-coin?! 

You find yourself in a group on some weird Russian hacking app called Telegram and find that it's being run by some cult, all they do is speak gibberish about buying pizza with these internet points. You aren't too sure, but you don't want to let these Russian propagandists win! 

You decide to ape $50 dollars and forget about it. 10 years pass and you are no longer married and your now ex-wife is calling you from her ex-boyfriends house and asking if she can move back in with you. You are startled by the idea because you haven't fucked anyone in nearly 9 years since she left you for drawing dicks on pizza charts for the russians. It's all a blur but she tells you that one of your bitcoins is worth $9,642 😱 

Now 10 years on, your wife is back and she's left her ex-boyfriend and things are worse than ever!

SO WHY NOT APE INTO $BTC ON $SOL TODAY AND YOU CAN RUIN YOUR LIFE TOO!

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,"$GIGA - Real meme, real meme coin - GigaChad meme coin on Solana","Hey GigaChads! 🗿

This is your moment, this is **the big one**. Think back to when **DOGE** and **PEPE** were just tiny pups with minuscule market caps. Now look at them, strutting around in the billions while we dream of our own crypto-fueled Lambos.

But let's be real here. What propelled DOGE and PEPE to **stratospheric heights**? It's simple: they're not just crypto trends; **they're real-world memes**. These are the memes that resonate with millions across platforms like crypto Twitter, Reddit, and mainstream social media. When the average Joe catches wind of DOGE or PEPE, it's like a switch flips, and they're hooked.

And let's give credit where it's due. The average Joe isn't just in it for a quick buck. They're in it for the long haul, **chasing those million-dollar dreams**.

Now, let's get to the main event: **$GIGA**. This is the big one, boys. **$GIGA** is the **GigaChad** meme coin on **Solana**, and if you haven't heard, **GigaChad** is a heavyweight in the meme world. It's more than just a meme; it's a lifestyle. Just glance at Instagram or TikTok, and you'll understand.

Remember, where attention goes, money follows. And $GIGA is positioned to capture billions worth of attention.

Boys, this one's different. They've gone all in with an LLC, paving the way to create a brand around the GigaChad meme coin, channeling profits back into the coin itself.

Oh! Yes, we own the ""@gigachad"" Twitter handle.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Why Now is the Perfect Time to Look at Ethereum Over Solana,"Hey Crypto Fam,  
I've been diving deep into the cryptosphere lately, and I've got to say, there's something in the air that's got me feeling a certain way. Solana had its moment, right? Everyone was talking about how it was the next big thing, the Ethereum killer, but then, bam, it hit the wall, dropped like a stone by 96%. Now, I know what you're thinking - ""Solana time might be coming again,"" but let's take a step back and look at where we stand now.

  
Ethereum's Undervalued Opportunity  
First off, Ethereum. Yeah, it's had its ups and downs, but right now, it's looking like it's at one of its lower points. If you've been in this game for a while, you know that Ethereum has this resilience that's hard to ignore. It's not just about the price; it's about the ecosystem. Ethereum has been the bedrock for DeFi, NFTs, and countless other dApps. The infrastructure, the developer community, the sheer amount of innovation - it's unmatched.   
With Ethereum possibly at its low, savvy investors are seeing this as the golden window. It's like buying real estate in a dip - you know it's going to come back, maybe even stronger. This isn't about FOMO; it's about recognizing potential. Ethereum projects, especially those in the low-cap sector, are where you might find your next ten-bagger, or dare I say, a moonshot.

  
The Case for $PEIRO  
Now, let's talk specifics. I've been scouring through the Ethereum landscape, and one project caught my eye: $PEIRO. I'm not here to shill, but let's break it down. $PEIRO might not be on everyone's radar yet, but that's exactly why it's interesting. Low cap means less attention, which often means more room for growth. Here’s what you need to know:  


* Innovative Use Case: $PEIRO isn't just another token; it's got a unique angle in the DeFi space. It's leveraging Ethereum's robust smart contract platform to offer something new, something with real utility.
* Community: The community around $PEIRO is buzzing with activity. Active development, community engagement, and those vibes are crucial for the long-term success of any crypto project.
* Potential: With Ethereum on the verge of another comeback, projects like $PEIRO could ride that wave. Remember, the early birds caught the gains with many of today's big names when they were just small cap projects.

Why Not Solana?  
Don't get me wrong, I'm not here to bash Solana. It's got its strengths, particularly with speed and fees. But when you're looking at where to park your money for potential moonshots, Ethereum's ecosystem at this point feels like a safer bet. Solana had its run, and while it might have another, the current sentiment leans heavily towards Ethereum's recovery and dominance.

  
Conclusion  
Look, if you're in for the long haul, Ethereum projects during a dip could be your ticket to significant gains. Projects like $PEIRO, with their innovative approaches and growing communities, are the ones to watch. Ethereum's time is now, not because it's an underdog, but because it's been the king, took a hit, and now it's gearing up for what could be an epic comeback.   
So, do your own research, but if you're asking me where the smart money might be moving - my eyes are on Ethereum. Find those low-cap gems, stay informed, and maybe, just maybe, you'll be holding the next big thing before everyone else does.  
Happy hunting, and may your crypto dreams turn into reality!  
This isn't financial advice, just a fellow crypto enthusiast sharing thoughts. Always do your own research and invest what you can afford to lose.

🍃 \*What is SOL100?\*

\----------------------------------

SOL100 is a scarcity token powered by the Solana blockchain. Inflationary cryptocurrencies and emulated fiats stray from Bitcoin and from long-term sustainability. SOL100 is more or less a clone of 42-coin, an old proof-of-work project, but with much more practicality and usability.

Pushing upwards of 50,000 transactions per second, Solana provides a sandbox enabling SOL100 the longevity necessary for it to become a mainstream store of value.

We are a team of programmers and venture capitalists from across the world. With over 300 years of combined experience. We anticipate witnessing decentralized, community fostered growth of the SOL100 ecosystem.​

\----------------------------------

\*TLDR;\*

🎃 Only 100 were minted, and then the mint was turned off permanently

👻 Collectible

🎃 Fair $100k market cap launch

👻 Appeals to NFT psychology

👻 70% of tokens are now available for the stealth public sale through the Raydium DEX

A Solana Memecoin with unique IRL utility, created by the team from DJenerates. Launched on the 26th of March with a supply of 10B, burnt LP, and doxxed team, Pepe DJen emerges from an existing ecosystem of electronic music enthusiasts building a Web3 music community that was launched in 2021.
Designed in classic Meme style and delivering all the engaging aspects of a vibrant memecoin offering, the team has also announced holders will receive access to their annual Web3 event at Amnesia Ibiza, one of the most iconic clubs in the world, and promise further utility to be announced. 

The tokenomics include a portion allocated to charities such as Bridges for Music and Bye Bye Plastic, placing them in the field of philanthropy while remaining in their niche of electronic music. 

In terms of community they already have an established Discord with almost 10k active members and the team is super active on social media. This looks like a sleeping giant to me and I am a holder from day one after having followed the team’s past projects.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,"Comprehensive Evaluation of $CATBAG: A New Solana-Based Cryptocurrency Project      
","**Overview of CATBAG ($CATBAG)**
  
CATBAG is presented as a new cryptocurrency project built on the Solana blockchain, aiming to offer significant growth opportunities to its investors. The project has garnered attention due to its endorsements from top influencers and private investment clubs. With imminent listings on major platforms such as Bitmart, CoinMarketCap, and CoinGecko, CATBAG aims to establish a strong presence in the crypto market.
  
**Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**
  
The project distinguishes itself with a ""special surprise"" for its community that could potentially drive at least 1000% growth. This indicates a strategy to create hype and anticipation among potential investors. Understanding the nature of this surprise and the feasibility of such growth figures is crucial for a thorough evaluation.
  
**Market Analysis**
  
A detailed analysis of the market positioning and the niche CATBAG intends to fill within the Solana ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency market is essential. Factors to consider include the project's target audience, the problem it aims to solve, and its competitive advantages over existing solutions.
  
**Technology and Security**
  
Given that CATBAG is built on the Solana blockchain, an evaluation of the technical aspects of the project should include the blockchain's performance metrics (such as transaction speed and fees) and how CATBAG leverages these features. Additionally, the security measures and audit results of CATBAG's smart contracts are critical to ensure investor confidence.
  
**Team and Partnerships**
  
The expertise and track record of the project's team can significantly influence its success. Information on the team's background, their experience in blockchain technology, and any notable partnerships with other entities should be scrutinized.
  
**Tokenomics**
  
An analysis of CATBAG's tokenomics should cover the total supply of tokens, distribution plans, any mechanisms for burning tokens, and how these factors might affect the token's price and scarcity.
  
**Community and Communication Channels**
  
The project's community engagement strategies, along with the activity and growth of its official communication channels (website, Twitter, Telegram), provide insights into its potential for achieving a network effect.
  
**Regulatory Considerations**
  
Understanding the regulatory landscape that CATBAG operates within is vital. This includes any potential legal challenges or compliance requirements, especially in jurisdictions with stringent cryptocurrency regulations.
  
**Potential Risks and Red Flags**
  
Any investment in cryptocurrency comes with risks. Identifying potential red flags, such as unrealistic growth promises, lack of transparent communication, or indications of a ""pump and dump"" scheme, is crucial.
  
**Conclusion and Personal Assessment**
  
A final personal assessment should weigh the potential benefits against the risks and uncertainties associated with CATBAG. This should include a reflection on the project's long-term viability and its alignment with the investor's risk tolerance and investment strategy.

**Project Highlights**  
  
\- Legacy of Success: The project draws inspiration from WoofDog, a previous initiative that successfully grew its market capitalization from $380K to an all-time high of $14.2 million.  
\- Central Exchange (CEX) Listings: The project has confirmed listings on multiple centralized exchanges, broadening its accessibility and potential for liquidity.  
\- Smart Contract Security: $BODOG's smart contract has undergone comprehensive audits to ensure security and reliability, addressing one of the critical concerns in the crypto space.

The project also aims for high visibility on platforms such as DexTools, DexView, DexScreener, and Ave.  
  
**Technical and Financial Aspects**  
  
\- Blockchain Foundation: Built on the Solana blockchain, $BODOG benefits from the network's high speed and low transaction costs, appealing attributes for a community-driven token.  
\- Investor Participation: The launchpad information on PinkSale provides potential investors with the opportunity to engage early in the project, with details on how to participate in the initial offering.  
  
**Community Engagement and Support**  
  
$BODOG places a strong emphasis on community, aiming to harness the collective power and enthusiasm of dog lovers and meme token investors. By fostering a supportive and active community, the project seeks to drive organic growth and sustain long-term engagement.  
  
**Research and Due Diligence**  
  
Prospective investors and participants are strongly encouraged to conduct their research and due diligence. This includes reviewing the smart contract audit report, understanding the tokenomics, evaluating the team's background and experience, and considering the potential risks and rewards associated with meme tokens.  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
The Book of Dog ($BODOG) presents itself as an exciting new venture in the meme token space, with strong ties to community engagement and a clear roadmap for growth.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Beyond Profit: The Ethical Investment Trend in Solana's Memecoin Market,"Exploring a new trend: Charitable Memecoins on Solana. With 3 Potential MoonShots that utilize this trend very well.  
The world of cryptocurrency is a fast-paced realm where memes and trends often dictate the narrative. However, amidst the chaos, a new trend is emerging on the Solana blockchain – one that combines profit with purpose. Enter $BARK, $CAN and $TRITU, three tokens leading the charge in leveraging crypto for good, proving that there's more to digital assets than meets the eye.

  
**🐶 $BARK: Supporting Our Furry Friends**  
For all the dog lovers out there, $BARK is more than just a memecoin – it's a movement. This token is on a mission to support animal shelters and rescue organizations, believing that every furry friend deserves a loving home. With weekly donations and a commitment to amplifying shelter success stories, $BARK isn't just raising funds; it's raising awareness about the plight of shelter animals. Join the movement and invest in creating a world where every pet has a forever home.  
At the heart of $BARK lies a commitment not just to words, but to action. With their doxed developers leading the charge, $BARK sets itself apart by conducting weekly donation videos where they visit animal shelters and personally hand over their contributions. These heartwarming gestures not only showcase the tangible impact of their efforts but also highlight the genuine care and dedication behind the project. In an age where authenticity resonates deeply with audiences, the potential for one of these videos to go viral is not just a possibility – it's a ticket to the moon for $BARK and its community.

**🐾 $CAN: Making a Difference, One Meow at a Time**

With a unique approach, $CAN pledges to feed stray cats for every milestone reached, showcasing their commitment through daily feeding sessions. With a community takeover model and a focus on social media outreach, $CAN is set to leave a paw print on the hearts of investors and cats alike.  
At the forefront of the $CAN movement is Fido Crypto, an influential figure from Greece whose dedication to the cause is palpable. For every 1k marketcap milestone reached, Fido Crypto takes to his Instagram and TikTok to document the heartwarming act of feeding a stray cat. These videos not only showcase the impact of $CAN's mission but also attract attention from a wide audience. With the potential for one of these videos to capture the internet's heart and spread like wildfire, the stage is set for $CAN to skyrocket to new heights, fueled by the compassion and dedication of its community.

**🤝 Collaboration Announcement: $TRITU x $CAN**  
But here's where the magic truly happens. $TRITU and $CAN are joining forces to create even more positive impact in the world. For every $25K marketcap gained by $TRITU, the $CAN team will step up and feed an additional stray cat. Moreover, at every $50K marketcap milestone, the $CAN team will donate to the Turtle Foundation on Curacao, extending their reach and support. It's a partnership built on shared values and a commitment to making a difference, one paw print and flipper at a time.  
With $TRITU and $CAN leading the charge, the future of crypto looks brighter and more compassionate than ever before. Join us on this journey to create meaningful change in the world, one token at a time!

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,GigaCat has entered the Solana stage but haven't started its pumping routine yet! Still an amazingly early entry for those who missed the launch.,"Giga Cat is the ultimate feline powerhouse, a symbol of strength and meme royalty. Forget your ordinary house cats - this one hits the gym harder than your favorite action hero! Giga Cat struts around flexing its rock-solid muscles while charming the internet with its irresistible kitty eyes. Whether it’s lifting the entire meme universe on its mighty paws or just casually swiping away weak vibes, Giga Cat is here to conquer the meme world with a blend of cuteness and raw, unfiltered power. Born to be the king of both the gym and the meme game, Giga Cat is your daily dose of motivation wrapped in fur. Expect nothing less than Herculean feats with a side of purring.

Massive marketing on first week ✅

DEX updated ✅

Safu & Clean contract ✅

CMC paid and will be listed ASAP ✅

Massive buybacks planned ✅

Renounced ownership ✅

Tax 0/0 ✅

LP locked ✅

GigaCat had a successful launch and presalers are revealing to be diamond holders by keeping a steady 50-60k floor. CoinMarketCap is going to be listed within the next hours so this is the last chance to grab a cheap bag before the chart takes off!

A YouTuber with tens of thousands of followers has been hired and will publish the first content soon. This beast cat is going to juice up to the millions, that's guaranteed.

The community is one of a kind: top tier raiders who grind X non-stop, 24h time zones covered and many other socials engagement are in line. Marketing lead is well known in the space for sending tokens to at least 7 figures so be assured you won't see this entry again. Still early 100%

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,why ETH memes do much better than SOL meme tokens. The alpha:,"9 of the top 10 Meme tokens are on ETH... sure, I hold SOL and made some money with sol/memes, but those buyers usually putting 20 bucks in hoping to make it back in an hour - and they need that money back.... Versus the typical ETH investor, they're putting in a few hundred bucks, and its not their only investment. they don't need that money back anytime soon, so they'll leave it in a token for weeks or months. THAT is why ultimately, ETH meme tokens are the ones that grow to a billion. Sounds sort of elitist, but its true. Irony is most of that divide was over gas fees--- used to be 25 bucks to make one trade on ETH, so it kept smaller players out and only big buyers in---- NOW the eth gas fee is 2 or 3 bucks--- so we maintain our whales, PLUS those who want to put 50 or 100 bucks in can do so comfortably. This is gonna be a 'meme cycle' this bull run and MEGA is gonna be a huge player. Quite sure we do a few hundred million--- thats realistic given the holders (look at their wallets) and of course our dev has a track record of other multi-hundred-million dollar projects. 

Knowing all this, SUGGEST you look at an eth project, MEGA, that has a dev with a track record of multi-hundred-million dollar projects and a group of holders with wallets you should investigate, simply to DYOR and see that MEGA is legit. Whales who have been in it for months knowing it is a bullrun 100x from here. 

MEGA celebrates ETH and the return of the eth token: ""MAKE ETH GREAT AGAIN""

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Atlas | The Official MAGA Dog | Making Sol great again one woof at a time!,"**What’s ATLAS about?**

* THE OFFICIAL DOG OF TRUMP'S 2024 CAMPAIGN

Atlas, a German Shepherd belonging to J.D. Vance, has quickly become a **symbolic and energetic figure on the 2024 Trump-Vance campaign trail.** Alongside Vance, the vice-presidential pick for Donald Trump, Atlas has accompanied the campaign’s rallies and appearances, often making a light-hearted contrast to recent news about the Biden White House’s handling of their own German Shepherds. In fact, Vance has joked about Atlas's friendly and calm demeanor, underscoring the dog's strong public appeal and helping to create a more personable image for the Trump-Vance ticket

Atlas's presence has added warmth to the campaign, with images of him alongside Vance and other Trump family members like Lara Trump, boosting relatability for the ticket. Whether at events or on social media, **Atlas represents a lighter side to a typically intense campaign environment, reinforcing the importance of relatability and personal appeal in shaping voter perceptions during this election cycle**

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$URF Token on Solana Network | New Token for the Unfortunate SOLs Out There,"Hey, fellow crypto enthusiasts! Gather around, gather around, for a tale as old as time... Well, not quite, but close enough. So, picture this: my nephew, who's name rhymes with URF, decides he's the next big shot in the crypto world. Spoiler alert: he's not. Kid burns through cash faster than you can say ""blockchain."" But fear not, for yours truly, Uncle $URF, has swooped in to save the day. Ah, the joys of family, right?  
  
Now, let's talk business. We're a memecoin on Solana because, let's face it, Ethereum's gas fees are higher than Elon Musk's ambitions. Our cap? A cool 4000 SOL. Yes, we like to dream big, but not ""Bitcoin hitting $1 million tomorrow"" big. We're realistic dreamers, you see.  
  
As for our allocation strategy, it's as straightforward as explaining blockchain to your grandma. 50% to the Liquidity Pool because, hey, stability is key. 10% to the unfortunate victims of my nephews escapades. Poor souls, they didn't stand a chance. And the remaining 40%? Well, that's going straight into our sale. Gotta keep the $URF train chugging along, am I right?  
  
So, buckle up, strap in, and get ready for the ride of your crypto life. This ain't your grandma's altcoin; this is $URF, the memecoin that's here to prove that even in the wild west of crypto, there's room for a little laughter... and a lot of profit. Welcome aboard, folks. Let's make some waves, or should I say, transactions?

Foxville is user friendly and forward looking platform that aims at evolving as a community.

Fair Comparison…

Foxville is a decentralized play to earn gaming platform that has integrated DeFi and gaming. It is a GameFi. It has an exciting farm based game unlike the usual old centralized free to play Farmville. Foxville has 11 different categories and 176 versatile traits.

|:-|:-|:-|
| Play to earn| Free to play||
| Decentralized| Centralized ||
| Multiverses| One universe||
| Better visuals, AR, VR| Augmented reality ||

  
 

This was a quick comparison between our childhood favorite, Farmville and blockchain integrated GameFi, Foxville. However, there are other farm based games on blockchain too.  


&#x200B;

| **Foxville** | **FarmTown** | **CryptoBytes**|

 The game of Foxville depends majorly on Fox-Farmers. These Fox-Farmers will be able to harvest crops, and perform other farm duties to create a lavishing farm. These farmers can then sell their assets in the Foxville marketplace to generate wealth to upgrade their living standard and their farm.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Atlas | The Only dog of MAGA! | Don't miss out on this Sol gem!,"**What’s ATLAS about?**

* THE OFFICIAL DOG OF TRUMP'S 2024 CAMPAIGN

Atlas, a German Shepherd belonging to J.D. Vance, has quickly become a **symbolic and energetic figure on the 2024 Trump-Vance campaign trail.** Alongside Vance, the vice-presidential pick for Donald Trump, Atlas has accompanied the campaign’s rallies and appearances, often making a light-hearted contrast to recent news about the Biden White House’s handling of their own German Shepherds. In fact, Vance has joked about Atlas's friendly and calm demeanor, underscoring the dog's strong public appeal and helping to create a more personable image for the Trump-Vance ticket

Atlas's presence has added warmth to the campaign, with images of him alongside Vance and other Trump family members like Lara Trump, boosting relatability for the ticket. Whether at events or on social media, **Atlas represents a lighter side to a typically intense campaign environment, reinforcing the importance of relatability and personal appeal in shaping voter perceptions during this election cycle**

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Alco Coin Presale Hits Hard Cap of 300 SOL in 4 Hours. The Next Solana Gem Launching Soon!,"Alco Coin, a new token on the Solana that has its roots in the HEGE community recently had a very successful presale. In just 4 hours, Alco Coin reached its presale cap of 300 SOL!

This rapid achievement has created a buzz in the crypto community, suggesting that Alco Coin might be the next big thing on Solana.

Why Alco Coin Could Be the Next Solana Gem?

Online casino Alco is planning to implement a online casino to bring utility and joy to the community! This feature matches Alco’s narrative perfectly.

Trusted Team and Proven Track Record One of the main reasons to be optimistic about Alco Coin is the team behind it. The developers and key members of the project are well-known in the crypto community and have a history of successful investments. Their previous investments are still going strong, which adds a layer of credibility, trust and liquidity to Alco Coin.

Strong Inner Circle The core team members are not just colleagues but a tight-knit group with established trust and cooperation. This inner circle has met each other mostly through another memecoin community and discord, ensuring a solid foundation for Alco Coin. Their experience and synergy are expected to drive the project forward, mitigating common issues that new crypto projects often face.

The Coming Bull Run The timing of Alco Coin's launch couldn't be better, with many analysts predicting an upcoming bull run in the cryptocurrency market. Historically, bull runs have been periods of substantial gains for promising projects. With the crypto market showing signs of recovery and renewed investor interest, Alco Coin is positioned to take full advantage of this potential upswing. During bull markets, projects with strong fundamentals and community backing, like Alco Coin, tend to perform exceptionally well. The confidence shown during the presale, combined with the broader market conditions, sets a promising stage for Alco Coin’s growth. Investors looking to capitalize on the anticipated bull run should consider keeping an eye on Alco Coin.

Looking ahead, Alco coin is a story driven memecoin which unlocks chapters and milestones at certain market caps. The 300 Sol presale was done within 4 hours, an estimated starting market cap of 100k will give investors plenty room to grow their bags. Alco coin has around 10% supply reserved for marketing and future CEX listings. At a market cap of 10 million a casino feature will be launched which matches with Alco’s narrative. Playing with Alco coins and other crypto will be a big thing. Investors don't have to worry about jurisdiction since Alco’s team has got guys to cover this!

Alco, our lovable, trouble-prone cat, has a penchant for high-stakes gambling, a soft spot for booze, and a knack for getting into purrposterous misadventures. Help Alco climb out of debt and into fortune, one market cap milestone at a time.

Join the Alco Coin community today and stay tuned for our upcoming launch!

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,"I’ve created possibly the dumbest sol gambling game imaginable, who wants to play?","**Would you trust a goldfish with your money at the casino?**   
  
This is the basic rundown of the game concept   
  
\- A single Goldfish in a fish tank that has a vertical line down the middle of it   
\- You place a bet on Left or Right   
\- 60 second timer   
\- At the beginning of the timer fish food drops into the tank  
\- The fish swims around the tank   
\- Whatever side of the line the fish is on at the end of the timer wins   
  
**It’s basically a binary betting game like hi/lo or coinflip where you can 2x your bet.**   
  
Bets will be made in FI$H tokens that players swap for Solana. My aim is to incorporate many tokens later on.   
  
I have developed a beta version of the game already with wallet connect, token balance and backend systems to make it work, the image recognition that’ll automate the results basically works by detecting ‘object present’ on one side or the other and triggering the win on either left or right.   
  
My goal with the token project is to eventually scale to the point where there can be a multitude of different fish related games   
\- Multiple fish (bet on how many will be on each side)  
\- Multiple fish (bet on an individual fish)   
\- PVP (bet against another player instead of the house)  
\- Roulette style fish tank (the tank is divided up into a grid and you can bet on which square the fish will be when times up)   
I’d like to get a proper streaming warehouse setup and get the live-streamed games to the point where proper casino integration is possible.   
  
**You can see the website with more info about it here SOLFISHTANK.COM/GAME**  
  
I’m having a presale for the token launch soon and have set up a bunch of tasks on my website so people can complete them, level up, and on launch day the different levels correlate to a different amount of airdropped tokens.   
  
**Here’s the token info:**  
  
Name: FISH  
Supply: 5B   
LQ: 47%  
Presale: 47%  
Marketing: 2%  
Team: 2%  
Game wallet: 2%  
Launch date: TBC  
Presale date: sometime in the next week  
Where: solfishtank.com   
  
I’d love to hear people’s thoughts on the concept and if a game like this fits into the world of crypto degen gambling projects as well as I think it does

Well, opportunity is knocking. This is the only coin in honor of Canada's next PM and is 22 days old sitting at 170k with a stable, organic chart. Team is based for the long game and in control of the supply. Also has supply set asside to support the conservative party of Canada if they accept.

Groundwork being laid, guerilla marketing to attract real, normie Canadians taking place. Most crypto degens will wait until its $1m+
We are very convicted and confident in the vision.

Check our website 🍎 https://www.solanapierre.com/

Pierre is in headlines daily and will soon be shaking hands on stage and getting talked about frequently by the likes of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. 

Early projections show Poilievre with massive leads against Trudeau. There is no question he will beat him in the election and quite possible a snap election gets called in canada any day now. Regardless, momentum for his name is beginning to build and this is the only crypto representing him being run by the most based team you could ask for, with morals and passion. So join us as we build this project up into the winner we believe it will be. Or fade us at your own risk 🙂

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,SonOfSafemoon $SOL Edition Launch in less then 4 hours.,"🚀 SonOfSafemoon Launch in less then 4 hours! 🚀

Sunday 3pm GMT



 **CA : AnBmMDD6qDVtTeQ8TSHLrpoLdqfp94KE3YDjejBVdA2U**



SonOfSafemoon has come a long way in the past 2 weeks. As a community we have grown over 250 members in the Telegram, nearly 1000 Followers on Twitter. This through our organic marketing, Giveaways, and community effort. Highlighted in our campaign is our tactical launch. When we launch on Sunday with a staggered presale launch.



The staggered launch will be an incentive for all presale holders to hold their bag so they don't affect their own profit. This entails thats 50% of all presale tokens will be released on Launch, and the other 50% will be released 6 hours later. 



Alongside our tactical launch we have  a mass amount of marketing going out on launch, and more marketing scheduled through the day. This marketing will be used when the price starts to decline to increase buy pressure and increase holders.



This is a memecoin and it will be botted, and we are awaiting the initial dump so that all the paperhands can get out and our proper marketing will come in. Just like the original SonOfSafemoon there will be so much marketing, and engagement that price after the initial dump won't have time to go down. 



Don't miss out on this gem. The team have put in alot of work, time and effort and its going straight to the moon!

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$HARAMBE on SOL looks like it could be a memecoin finally worthy of the name. It’s already doing numbers.,"Crypto X (formerly Twitter) has been the Cincinnati Zoo for the past 24 hours, in what has to be the most ape posting since the Reddit fueled short squeeze season of ‘21. Everyone seems to have their 🍆s out for Harambe with the launch of yet another memecoin memorializing the greatest silverback gorilla of our generation, who left us far too soon. What makes this time different, however, is peak Solana memecoin euphoria. SOL has perhaps found it’s calling with low transaction fee on-chain sh*tcoining, as nearly every token that doesn’t instantly rug the LP has a chance at multiples. Now combine that with the best known and most memeable gorilla on earth, at a time that is starting to feel reminiscent of the 2021 bull run, and you have the potential for something explosive. And I’m not sure Reddit has even heard about it yet.

Harambe wasn't just an ape; he was a symbol of unity and, ultimately investment prowess. An internet sensation is a gross understatement of his lasting impact, which is about to enter a new chapter in the 2024 bull. In his memory, let us remember to approach life with the same curiosity and fearlessness that he exhibited, whether it's climbing the tallest tree or facing any other challenge that comes our way. Let Harambe's legacy inspire the next generation of sh*tcoiners to reach new heights, but always with a heart full of compassion. May he rest in peace, beating his chest from the treetops of our fondest memories. HARAMBE will set us free.

$HARAMBE on SOL is sitting at a $10M market cap at the time of this writing and your author holds a bag. So send it. For Harambe.",104,2024-01-19 15:23:18,67

You can join us now or just sit back and watch the magic unfold. Either way, it's gonna be a wild ride.

This has to be THE most creative, fun, and entertaining memecoin out there, plus an AMAZING community of diamond hands.

Join the TG and marvel at the ridiculously master crafted memes. Chat with team of 37 that never quit. Get your pfp ""bricked up"" in the meme channel. And load up while the price is criminally undervalued because it won't last long.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,HEGE Soaring even when SOL is down!,"SOL down 3%...yet HEGE up 40%!! Join the HEGE fund and you'll see why!

Solana, and the general crypto market, has been taking a massive dump the past few days. While Solana is down 3% on the daily, it's down nearly 10% on the weekly. $HEGE, on the contrary, is up 40% on the daily, and 24% on the weekly. Why is that?

1. A wildly devoted community, 2 months strong, that is diamond-handed, chronic DCAers, and talented. We are a serious, long-term project. Despite being a memecoin, we are working on legitimate utility as I write this—we're excited to unveil that.

2. Our meme is unique. We are not another dog, cat, a ""wif"", a ""pepe"", a politician, a celebrity, etc. Same old same old, and probably 80% of them rug (I've been rugged 7 times), 18% die and a few make it. Our memes, animations, and content in general is top notch. Check out our X (insert link) and our website hegecoin.com you'll see why. Content is king, and people are figuring that out. A little birdie even told me that Wallstreetbets DM'd us...

3. We have a story with AI characters mimicking those characters. Seriously, these characters are wild, and one of them (Hendrix) basically picks fights with people on sports posts. We've kind of lost control of him. Check them out and you'll see just how detailed we get.

4. CEX listing is imminent. Within a week or so, we will be listed on TooBit. Some will say, ""big deal""—there are 2 million users there, and over 700k of them are active daily. We are going to nab a lot of those and have the marketing funds to do so.

5. Hege is inevitable. We are the anti-rug, the anti-shitcoin, with an insane liquidity ratio that makes it impossible for anyone to rug us (seriously—impossible). We eat dips like it's nothing—look at our chart and you'll see what I say is true.

So what does all this mean? What happens when Solana recovers, and the true bull-run of all bull-runs begins? $HEGE will recover with it, except in multitudes, as promising memes with low MCs usually do. You've seen the WIFs, the Kendus, the Bodens. Hell, you've profited from SOL itself. It's time to roll those profits into $HEGE and get that 100x with house money.

The above is a power, common mantra not only in the crypto space, but the wider world as a whole, and we are the embodiment of it. By combining LFG with LEGO and using AI to brickify just about anything inside and outside the crypto space - we meme the memes, adapt to new trends and can quickly play into any new metas.



With nothing but insane normie appeal, LFGO is a super fun, adaptable concept, and branding that is instantly recognisable, yet still original in so many ways! 



LFGO started its life on pump fun back on April 8th, where it quickly gained popularity. However, the original Dev pulled the rug and the community picked up the pieces and took over. And what a take over it was. Grabbing the bull by the horns, the dedicated team and community have taken this project from strength to strength. They’ve taken a simple idea and turned it into a fully functioning crypto project, with a core team of 37 working around the scenes and nothing but a bright future ahead.



Oh, and did we mention that LFGO has got the BEST website in crypto, showcasing the amazing content all created by the community - come and take a look!

\- Expansive & Experienced team with multi mill MC past projects (Gemcave, BearBNB)  
This adds lots of trust in the project for me, knowing that the previous project communities have stayed with this team through the bear market says something.  


\- 2 Utilities already live.  
They have released a fruit machine and a Cactus Grow game already, free to play for users. $MYCAC is being won by holders daily.  


\- They are over 3 weeks old  
This shows commitment from the team and the presence of a continuous push from the both team & community.  


\- Listen to the latest voice chat by the Cactus team.  
They explain who they team are and what their plans are. Very bullish voice chat to give a listen to.  


Conclusion:  
In conclusion, knowing that this team are capable of so much more, I am intrigued to learn what the next utility will be. I'm also excited to see how these guys can perform in a bullmarket, they managed to create a 3M MC project in 2022 during a terrible bear market (GemCave). For that reason I am expecting big things from the Cactus team and community.

**Summary:**

Sol Streams is an early-stage project within the Solana ecosystem that aims to bring Streaming, Hosting Spaces and Webinars to a decentralized ecosystem, **If you prefer meme coins over utility plays this may not be for you.**  
  
**Project Screening** **Sol Streams:** Project most definitely has potential, low market cap currently. Reminds me of SolChat, SolGram, SolFiles. All coins that reached over 10million market cap. The project has a clean website, Solid Art, and a bullish narrative.   


Definitely have my eyes on this one. 

As of making this post, the market cap is **20k**. With the proper eyes, not saying it will, but very possible to go to 1m+ market cap since it is a **utility play.**  


**Pros:** 

\- Solid Narrative

\- Clean Website

\- Team seems genuine and wants community input when building

\- Team shows sneak peaks in the telegram groupchat

\- Not a memecoin, therefore there is actual development happening behind the scenes

**Cons:**

\- You never know in web3, really. 

\- Low market cap 

  
**ROADMAP:** 

1. Development
2. Token Launch
3. Sol Streams Dapp Release on March 27th
4. Allow Username claiming on March 27
5. Onboard a couple influencers to the platform to host some spaces
6. Users are able to host spaces as well, build a following and earn.
7. Listed on Dex
8. Seek Community feedback and suggestions 
9. Become well respected in the solana ecosystem and the goto for decentralized streams and spaces

**Community:** 

The telegram groupchat has over 100 people. All excited for what's to come. The **Team has stated** this in there, **in** **quote**: ""We want to release a **solid product**, we also know that the best products are the ones that **listen the community**. So we will do this. Want to gather as much user feedback and suggestions as possible to create a **solid product**. All of this will come once we start our beta.""

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$NEIRO on SOL - The first and original Neiro memecoin,"For people that are unfamiliar with the memecoin world, the original owner of Doge, the dog that became a worldwide meme, adopted a new dog called Neiro 3 months ago.

After this announcement, the first ever Neiro memecoin was launched on Solana with this CA: **CTg3ZgYx79zrE1MteDVkmkcGniiFrK1hJ6yiabropump.**

Despite many copycats, the first $NEIRO absolutely exploded and reached 55mil market cap. Right now it is sitting at only 4mil with over 10k holders, 15k X followers and an insane community.

I also have to mention that $NEIRO is a CTO token. This means that the community is running it so there is no dev going to rug anyone.

The reason I am sharing this coin is that it is one of my biggest conviction plays of this bullrun. 

Because as Murad said: **“**95% of people who made it big in Crypto, did so by holding for months or even years. That’s the same way people will make it big with Memecoins. Holding strong coins for over a year is Key.**“**

Also this $NEIRO was not bundled unlike other copycats on Solana or Ethereum. Following the same principle as $DOGE and other og memecoins.

I really believe in the future of this coin because as soon as people stop talking about the Ethereum version, this $NEIRO will attract wider audience and sooner or later reach new ATH. So it is up to you if you join us on this way or not because we are going to make it with or without you.

P.S. Our contract address ends with 'bropump' – how is that not bullish?

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,SOLAMA - A CTO project striving to become to best meme-coin on the Sol blockchain,"SOLAMA: The Memecoin with Its Own Casino – A New Player in Crypto

Cryptocurrencies are all about innovation, community, and finding creative ways to stand out. The latest token making waves in the memecoin world is SOLAMA, which has introduced a unique twist: its own dedicated casino. This casino is not only an entertaining platform for users but also a strategic source of funding, with all profits going directly towards the growth and development of SOLAMA. In this blog, we’ll look at what SOLAMA is, why the casino is a game-changer, and what this could mean for SOLAMA’s price in the near future.

What is SOLAMA?
SOLAMA is a fresh and fun memecoin inspired by the Solana blockchain and the community-driven spirit of other successful memecoins. However, SOLAMA is taking things a step further by creating a source of funding that goes beyond social media hype and speculative buying. Through its innovative casino platform, SOLAMA provides both entertainment and a consistent funding stream that could help fuel its growth and increase its value over time.

The idea behind SOLAMA is simple: create a community-focused, entertaining token that everyone can enjoy while providing extra utility through a casino that supports its value. This approach aligns with the token’s mission of building a fun, sustainable project backed by real revenue.

The SOLAMA Casino: Fueling Growth and Value
One of the standout features of SOLAMA is its own casino. Here’s why this casino is a brilliant addition to the project:

Revenue Generation: Unlike other memecoins that rely solely on community donations or external funding, SOLAMA has established its own casino where all profits go directly towards supporting the SOLAMA project. This ensures a steady stream of funding that can help the coin maintain its upward momentum and enhance its stability.

Community Entertainment: The casino isn’t just about funding—it’s also a place where the SOLAMA community can come together, play games, and enjoy exclusive events. By combining entertainment with investment, SOLAMA is adding a new layer of engagement for its holders.

Increasing Token Value: With profits from the casino continually reinvested in SOLAMA, the token’s value could see steady and potentially significant growth. This strategy creates a positive feedback loop: the more people play, the more funds are raised, leading to greater investment in the token and its ecosystem.

How the Casino Could Drive Value
With the unique advantage of a self-sustaining casino, SOLAMA’s price outlook is more promising than ever. Let’s explore how this could affect SOLAMA’s price over the coming months

Short-Term Prediction
In the short term, SOLAMA’s casino has the potential to attract significant attention from the crypto community. As word spreads about this innovative funding model, we could see a sharp rise in SOLAMA’s popularity—and its price.

Medium-Term Prediction
The casino is a major differentiator for SOLAMA and could be pivotal in driving long-term value. Over the next few months, as the casino attracts more users, it could become a stable source of financing for the project, supporting everything from marketing to potential listings.

Long-Term Potential
The casino’s success could make SOLAMA a standout in the world of memecoins, providing it with a sustainable edge that many other tokens lack. The combination of community support and continuous casino revenue means that SOLAMA could establish itself as a strong, lasting presence in the market.

Why SOLAMA Could Be the Next Big Memecoin
SOLAMA’s unique casino gives it a significant edge, adding real utility and a sustainable funding model to what would otherwise be a speculative token. By combining entertainment with investment, SOLAMA has created a fun, community-driven project with a practical revenue stream. This innovative approach has the potential to make SOLAMA much more than just another memecoin—it could become a real powerhouse in the crypto space.

The **Satan Obol** is edgy, dark-themed memes, sparking intrigue and building a unique cult following. Aiming in drawing in an audience of rebels and misfits.

With each passing day, **Satan Obol** gathers more followers who resonate with its “no blessings, no preachings” ethos. This is more than a token; it's a rebellion in the crypto sphere. Personally, I see great potential in this its mission.

What makes **$OBOL** stand out is its fiercely dedicated community, the “Underworld Network.” This project thrives on the passion and creativity of its members, who rally behind Satan Obol’s anti-establishment vision.

I think the media hype on social media platforms like TikTok for example are creating an easy money narrative, but  nothing is easy when trying to find legitimate projects that are safe, where you can sleep at night not worrying first thing in the morning if the rug has been slid from under you,  it’s a horrible feeling knowing you was used and all along you was putting your trust in someone you didn’t even know and that has the power take everyone’s money and run. 

So why do I think we should support community takeover projects like $MOONG and $BNANA? 

Community project are run by the holders and most of these holders are probably down on there investment because of the rug, and by that you know they are committed to the token for the long term and to stick 2 fingers up at the scamming old devs, while any new investors are getting a really good entry price. For instant both $MOONG and $BNANA are low market cap under 50k so even a small climb to 400k is a 8x on your investment. 

But how do we know someone from the community can’t rug again? 

both $MOONG and $BNANA have locked Liquidity pools that have been burnt forever and contracts have been renounced, and scam dev have sold all their bags so nobody owns or can change it meaning it’s a much safer token then all the new hyped up ones ready to steal your hard earned money. 

Further more both projects have organised admins out of the communities to oversee and communicate with every holder to discus direction, marketing, utility etc. every voice is heard. The proof is in the pudding they say, well yes that’s very true, so what have they done since the community takeover? 

When doing a takeover you have to make if official, which $MOONG And $BNANA have paid and completed   which you can view on dex screener,
Along with new websites, telegram, Twitter and Reddit accounts. 

Why I think people overlook community takeovers? 

Well this is simple, the chart shows the scam dev rug pull red candle, there is no way to reset for the new community takeover so you need to forget the chart pre takeover, and in both cases you can see they are holding strong and will only take a small influx of investors to start climbing back to where they belong with healthy profit for new investors. 

It’s time to stop giving dodgy devs our time, support, and most importantly our money to run away with, instead invest in the people like us and help be a part of something more. 

I will post details below for  $MOONG and $BNANA for those they wish to find out more.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Here’s why $POWSCHE is currently the best crypto investment in $SOL memecoin space. Maths can’t lie,"$POWSCHE is currently the best entry coin in the $SOL memecoin marketplace based on FOUR key areas:

#1. Community

- $Powsche has a solid community that has weathered market stress and sell-offs. Other top coins such as $HEGE and $Kendu haven’t yet experienced this - you don’t know what will happen to the holders when this happens. 

#2. Experienced Dev

- $Powsche has a committed Dev that has done nothing but work harder with marketing through the market fear. He has a plan and knows the right time to pull the trigger. There are recent plant for the Dev’s to move in together in July for closer brainstorming to plan our way above and beyond the hundreds of millions in MC. 

#3. Roadmap

- This consists of a few points. A Porsche will be given away at $10M MC. A Tesla will be burnt at $50M and a Lambo at $100M. These will occur on live stream. If you don’t own the coin, you know you’d atleast be interested in watching this on video. If you do own the coin, you can be sure this will attract attention and result in upside potential. 
- There are a few more massive events occurring and you can see it all for yourself. It’s transparently listed on the website Powsche.com

#4. Upside potential. 

Exactly why Kendu is NOT a good option right now. The other good ones are $HEGE and $POWSCHE.

These are the top 3 in my books.

I believe $HEGE is in a bit of a craze right now reaching ATH and needs to cool down for a few days.

Though, $POWSCHE has seen some rough weathers with a top holder losing his wallet and causing a sell-off. They’re down at a perfect entry point around 1.3M MC. I believe this is the best entry point of the 3 right now in terms of gains.

The truth is that all of these coins will succeed but $POWSCHE is primed for the biggest move, then $HEGE, and then $Kendu. Think about it - all have good communities but a 10x for Powsche is 13M ($11.7M+) 80M for $HEGE ($72M+) and almost $2B ($1.8B+) for Kendu.

Do the maths, DYOR, and do well.

For these reasons, I’ve migrated my biggest bag to $POWSCHE and now hold over 200k. 

See you at the Telegram! ",20,2024-06-18 13:53:04,16

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Alco Coin Presale Hits 300 SOL in 4 Hours: The Next Solana Gem?,"I wanted to share some exciting news about Alco Coin (symbol: ALCOHOL), a new token on the Solana blockchain that recently had a very successful presale. 
In just 4 hours, Alco Coin reached its presale cap of 300 SOL! 

This rapid achievement has created a buzz in the crypto community, suggesting that Alco Coin might be the next big thing on Solana.

Why Alco Coin Could Be the Next Solana Gem?

Online casino
Alco is planning to implement a online casino to bring utility and joy to the community!
This feature matches Alco’s narrative perfectly.

Trusted Team and Proven Track Record
One of the main reasons to be optimistic about Alco Coin is the team behind it. The developers and key members of the project are well-known in the crypto community and have a history of successful investments. Their previous investments are still going strong, which adds a layer of credibility, trust and liquidity to Alco Coin. 

Strong Inner Circle
The core team members are not just colleagues but a tight-knit group with established trust and cooperation. This inner circle has met eachother mostly through other memecoin community’s and discord, ensuring a solid foundation for Alco Coin. Their experience and synergy are expected to drive the project forward, mitigating common issues that new crypto projects often face.

The Coming Bull Run
The timing of Alco Coin's launch couldn't be better, with many analysts predicting an upcoming bull run in the cryptocurrency market. Historically, bull runs have been periods of substantial gains for promising projects. With the crypto market showing signs of recovery and renewed investor interest, Alco Coin is positioned to take full advantage of this potential upswing.
During bull markets, projects with strong fundamentals and community backing, like Alco Coin, tend to perform exceptionally well. 
The confidence shown during the presale, combined with the broader market conditions, sets a promising stage for Alco Coin’s growth. Investors looking to capitalize on the anticipated bull run should consider keeping an eye on Alco Coin.

Looking Ahead
Alco coin is a story driven memecoin wich unlocks chapters and milestones at certain market caps. The 300 Sol presale was done within 4 hours, an estimated starting market cap of 100k will give investors plenty room to grow their bags. Alco coin has around 10% supply reserved for marketing and future CEX listings. 
At a market cap of 10 million a casino feature will be launched wich matches with Alco’s narretive. Playing with Alco coins and other crypto will be a big thing. Investors dont have to worry about jurisdiction since Alco’s team has got guys to cover this!

Alco, our lovable, trouble-prone cat, has a penchant for high-stakes gambling, a soft spot for booze, and a knack for getting into purrposterous misadventures. Help Alco climb out of debt and into fortune, one market cap milestone at a time.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Pepe on Sol | update ATH | ticker $PEPE | the flippening is real | ATH 14m | 8m mcap dip | community is everything,"Hey fellow crypto enthusiasts,  
  
I wanted to kickstart a discussion about something that's been buzzing in the crypto sphere lately: Pepe on Solana, with the ticker $PEPE. This little frog has been hopping around Ethereum for a while now, with a market cap of around 400 million and a peak market cap of 1.4 billion. But guess what? We're eyeing a flip to Solana, and here's why it's got potential:  
  
🌟 Strong Community: First things first, let's talk about the community. The $PEPE gang on Ethereum has been nothing short of amazing, with meme creators, investors, and tech enthusiasts all joining forces. And now, with the move to Solana, we're ready to expand and explore new horizons together.  
  
💡 No Dev to Dump on Us: One of the things that bugs us all in the crypto world is devs holding a ton of tokens, ready to dump them on unsuspecting investors. Well, fear not, because in the world of $PEPE on Solana, there are no devs waiting to rain on our parade. It's a fair game, and that's something we can all get behind.  
  
🎯 Early Snipers Out, New Opportunities In: You know how it goes—early investors come and go, making their quick gains and leaving the rest of us wondering what's next. But with $PEPE's move to Solana, most of those early snipers have already made their moves. That means there's a fresh wave of opportunities for us to dive into.  
  
🎨 Memes Galore: Let's not forget the memes! They've always been a big part of the crypto culture, and with $PEPE on Solana, the memes are already flowing. From hilarious artwork to playful jokes, the creativity of this community knows no bounds.  
  
🔥 Solana vs Ethereum Pepes: Now, here's where it gets interesting. As the crypto market heats up, the battle between Solana and Ethereum Pepes is heating up too. While Ethereum has its strengths, Solana offers scalability and speed like no other. It's a showdown we're all eager to watch unfold.  
  
So, what do you think? Are you ready to join the $PEPE movement on Solana? Let's hear your thoughts, fellow hodlers. We're in this for the long haul, and together, we'll ride the waves of the crypto market like true champions. 🚀🐸

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$NOBGOB MEV bot will earn you daily SOL ,"Ah, mate, you're diving into the world of $NOBGOB MEV bot, are ya? Well, strap in, because this ain't your grandma's knitting club! 

So, you're telling me you wanna hear about this cheeky little bot causing a stir in the crypto jungle, huh? Well, let me tell ya, this $NOBGOB MEV bot is like a ninja in the shadows, snatching up those sweet, sweet profits before you can even say ""moonshot""! 

Picture this: you're minding your own business, trying to make a trade, and BAM! The $NOBGOB MEV bot swoops in, front-runs your transaction, and walks away with your lunch money faster than you can say ""rug pull""! 

But hey, don't fret, my fellow degen! Knowledge is power in this wild west of crypto, so keep your wits about you, stay sharp, and maybe, just maybe, you'll outsmart that sneaky $NOBGOB MEV bot one day! 
The bot will also arbitrage and snipe to increase its power in the space, a 3-in-one bot that has no limits!

Remember, in the world of crypto, it's not just about hodling, it's about outsmarting the bots, riding the waves, and maybe, just maybe, finding that elusive pot of gold at the end of the rainbow! 

So, keep your eyes peeled, your fingers nimble, and may the crypto gods be ever in your favor as you navigate the treacherous waters of $NOBGOB MEV bot madness!

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$Odie on Sol $160k solid holders remain ready to pump,"$Odie on Sol floor $160k MC

The Memecoin that is packing a punch to knockout his opponents! With the intention of an anti-rug memecoin this founder is aiming to give back to his investors much more than just a safe meme experience. Already providing .1 sol per week to LP providers over 500$ they are growing quickly! Also airdropped this week other tokens to people engaged with community no matter wallet size. 

$Odie was created to be educational and fun. The DEV wanted workers and the grinders to feel safe coming to Odie for an investment not just a pump and dump trade. He is looking to provide real value with many real revenue generating plans. Dev comes from a real life background of running 100 million dollar projects is aiming to navigate throught the crypto space with an underdog! 

Giving back to rugged communities is ongoing, as the dev has placed funds from his own pocket back into others. This aligns with his goal of restoring faith in crypto projects and being the change he wanted to see! He wants to view crypto as an investment not insiders capitalizing on hard workers money. Dev started several different liquidity pools with other coins not just the sol pool you see on dexscreener. 

With an NFT project coming soon when the time is right m that may be a game changer to solana and a trustwothy solid group moving it, its worth a closer look. Ok, so talk is cheap. Most original whales are still holding after launching 4/20/24

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,PEANIE on Sol | Cutest flying penguin | LP burnt | CG/CMC/Moontok listings | BEST CULT,"Introducing the newest and cutest crypto sensation: Peanie! Ever wondered what happens when a developer's daydreams collide with a cute, fluffy penguin? Let’s give you a little backstory about the first ever flying penguin!

Imagine this: a lone developer, eyes glued to the screen, when suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, inspiration strikes in the form of a penguin-shaped daydream. That's right, folks – Peanie waddled into their mind and refused to leave until it became a reality.

And let me tell you, the response has been nothing short of a penguin parade! From the get-go where Peanie was introduced on pump-fun, it has captured the hearts of crypto enthusiasts far and wide. It's not just a coin; it has become a cozy nest of community love, where everyone's welcome to join the Penguin's very own cult.

Now, let's talk some numbers, shall we? – but don't worry, no math quiz here! Since its grand entrance in May, Peanie's value has soared higher than a penguin's leap off an icy cliff. With a market cap now topping $39 million, it's safe to say Peanie has learned to fly!

But wait, there's more! Peanie isn't just making waves in the crypto world – it's leaving footprints on every platform it touches. With listings on Jupiter's strict list, trending on Weibo, conquering CoinGecko and Moontok, and awaiting approval from CoinMarketCap, Peanie's presence is spreading faster than a penguin's slide on fresh ice.

And let's not forget the community – with 2200 followers on X and a whopping 3400 members on Telegram, Peanie's cult is growing by the minute!

What's next for our pint-sized hero? Well, that's a story yet to unfold, but one thing's for sure: Peanie's got its sights set on the stars and is ready to fly. So buckle up, this little penguin is about to make some big waves in the crypto ocean. Let's slide into the future together, one happy waddle at a time! 🐧🚀

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Alco Coin hits Presale hard cap of 300 SOL in 3 Hours: The Next Solana gem is launching in 2 days!,"Exciting news about Alco Coin (symbol: ALCOHOL), a new token on the Solana blockchain! In just 3 hours, Alco Coin reached its presale cap of 300 SOL. 

Why Alco Coin Could Be the Next Solana Gem?
Large Marketing Budget
One significant advantage for Alco Coin is that the team has allocated a large marketing budget to ensure widespread visibility and adoption. With several thousands available just after launch, the team has the resources to drive the project's success.
Post-Launch Marketing Strategies
For a meme coin developer, here are three effective marketing strategies to consider after launching:

1.	Influencer Partnerships: Collaborate with popular crypto influencers to promote Alco Coin. Influencers can reach a large audience quickly, providing credibility and exposure to the coin.
2.	Social Media Campaigns: Launch targeted advertising campaigns on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and TikTok. Engaging content and regular updates can attract and retain a loyal community.
3.	Community Incentives: Organize giveaways, airdrops, and referral programs to encourage community participation and word-of-mouth promotion. Rewarding early adopters can create a strong, supportive base for Alco Coin.

The Coming Bull Run
The timing of Alco Coin's launch couldn't be better, with many analysts predicting an upcoming bull run in the cryptocurrency market. Historically, bull runs have been periods of substantial gains for promising projects. With the crypto market showing signs of recovery and renewed investor interest, Alco Coin is positioned to take full advantage of this potential upswing. Projects with strong fundamentals and community backing, like Alco Coin, tend to perform exceptionally well during bull markets. The confidence shown during the presale, combined with broader market conditions, sets a promising stage for Alco Coin’s growth. Investors looking to capitalize on the anticipated bull run should consider keeping an eye on Alco Coin.

Looking Ahead
Alco Coin is a story-driven meme coin that unlocks chapters and milestones at certain market caps. The 300 SOL presale was completed within 4 hours, and an estimated starting market cap of 100k will give investors plenty of room to grow their bags. Alco Coin has around 10% supply reserved for marketing and future CEX listings.
Upcoming Casino Launch
When Alco Meme Coin hits a market cap of 10 million, it will launch an online casino where people can play with ALCO tokens and other cryptocurrencies. This feature matches Alco’s narrative perfectly, and players don't have to worry about jurisdiction since Alco’s team has covered this aspect thoroughly.

Launch Details
Alco Meme Coin is launching on Meteora, a platform known for its benefits for both developers and investors. Meteora offers:
•	For Developers: Lower fees, faster transactions, and a robust development environment.
•	For Investors: Increased security, better scalability, and a user-friendly interface.
Mark your calendars for the launch on July 27th at 1 PM EST. Here are the launch times for the three biggest time zones:
•	EST (Eastern Standard Time): 1 PM
•	PST (Pacific Standard Time): 10 AM
•	CET (Central European Time): 7 PM

Join the Alco Coin community and be part of this exciting journey. Our lovable, trouble-prone cat, Alco, has a penchant for high-stakes gambling, a soft spot for booze, and a knack for getting into purrposterous misadventures. Help Alco climb out of debt and into fortune, one market cap milestone at a time!",10,2024-07-25 20:12:18,7

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,URL previews and verifying links before clicking for SOL memecoin safety,"Memecoin trading is already risky enough as our asset class is very speculative and high in movement, the worst would be to also fall victim to scams due to a lack of attention to security. 

A simple way to avoid getting scammed is to be very cautious about the links you click. The basis of scams in crypto is often designed to exploit your desire for a quick buck and carelessness.

To avoid significant financial losses, pay attention for a few minutes and keep your wallet intact by being vigilant and taking proactive steps.



Here's a guide to help you protect yourself with unknown links:

**Unknown links are not your friends**

Your favorite and other known trading crypto bots are often impersonated by fake bots. If you don’t double-check the right link/username for a trading bot, you’re likely to send your funds somewhere that doesn’t belong to you, or at least with the capacity to return these assets back to yourself. 

Avoid clicking on every link you come across, as doing so could lead to your personal information being compromised or even your computer being infiltrated with malware. With one click, a ton can happen. Do not underestimate the impact of one click. Prioritize security to protect your investments above all.



**Using token scanners and explorers**

To verify the legitimacy of a token and its official links, use tools like token sniffers and blockchain explorers to preview the legit URLs, allowing you to trade the right smart contract and follow the right social media profiles.



**CEXs and DEXs can be impersonated too**

Even if you have used a platform a thousand times, make sure to bookmark the legit URLs of the platforms you use to avoid ever giving your login information to a fake website pretending to be the exchange you use. Bookmarking URLs is an easy practice to keep you safe.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$SKID Success Kid on Sol! Heard about this hidden gem yet?,"**$SKID is a true hidden gem that's about to pop, IMHO**  
[https://successkidsol.com](https://successkidsol.com)    


  
**Here are some reasons I'm bullish on it as a 10x, 100x, who knows? potential:**

  
\-> **Low marketcap** right now (5-6M), but has been as high as 20M in the last month.  

\-> **Transparent Dev Team that works HARD**.  This is absolutely not a rug pull.  Join the telegram, hang out for a a couple days and you'll understand.  Or just check here: [https://rugcheck.xyz/](https://rugcheck.xyz/) 

\-> **THE MEME - it's an OG meme**, the Success Kid, that everyone knows!  When normies fomo into crypto in the next month, do you think they will be buying '$BUTTCOIN'?  Naw bro, they'll be buying memes they recognize, like Success Kid $SKID

\-> **Elon Musk**, has tweeted this specific meme three times in the last year - all it takes is one Elon Tweet and this can pop off

\-> **The OG Success Kid**, Sammy Griner (from the meme) - the team is in talks with Sammy and his family - there is interest in partnership.  The community has created a wallet for Sammy of $SKID that he can claim.  

\-> **Narrative Utility** \- Success Kid is all about finding success in life.  The coin celebrates and promotes crypto success.  The Success Kid YouTube channel just released it's first Success Kid YouTube episode featuring the story of popular YouTuber, Crypto Jon.  The Narrative of success is crypto has a massively wide and broad appeal.

\-> **Practical Utility** \- $SKID gives back - the team has set Marketcap benchmarks to give back in charitable way to people who need a hand up in life.  Two charitable projects have already received donations from $SKID

\-> **Tokenomics are AWESOME** \- no secret stashes, no new minting, etc - the devs bought their coins just like the community.  
\-> **Exchanges - Decentralized & Centralized!** \- Available on Raydium and Jupiter, but also listed last week on the BitMart Exchange.  More exchange listings are imminent.

\-> **Marketing & Social Media** \- Foundation laid on several - Telegram, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, etc - the community and team are building awareness about this project.  When normies look into $SKID, they will find content.

\-> **YouTube Influencers** \- Has been promoted by YouTube influencers such as Joe Parys - calling it a blue chip meme that could be the next 1000x - https://youtu.be/YqFxi9UqpZ4?si=AuOp-sF-2ENeOJsY&t=1933  Also check out Crypto Secret X on YT for in depth analysis.   


  
That's it from me - DYOR, but the coin is popping today - could be the last time to get in before we 4x to ATH's in short order.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Why $HEGE is crazy undervalued right now. Highest upside potential of any other Sol coin.,"Hi all! Today I wanted to share with you my thoughts about one of the most promising projects in the Solana memecoin space. If you are active around crypto Reddit, you've probably heard about Hege already. What I want to tell you is why Hege is EXTREMELY underpriced right now, and why when this changes we're going up to the tens of millions.

First, $Hege has an holder count of more than 5000 members. Our holders have been growing almost every single day ever since launch two months ago. We are now at 4.2 millions, with double the holders we had at this MC in previous pumps.  The chart has been consolidating for a couple weeks and is now ready for a huge leg up.

Higher highs, lower lows, increasing volume and double the holders we had before our last leg up. We all know what that means, right?


But apart from technicalities, charts and holders, I wanna tell you why Hege will undoubtedly reach tens of millions on his next pump.  
The project is golden. Check out ANY memecoin over 100millions and look at their website. Brett, Popcat, nubcat... Then check out Hegecoin.com.
The difference in quality is EXTREME. And the coins I mentioned are not in the 10-50mil range. __They are worth hundreds of millions.__

__Hegecoin is not a MS paint low quality Coin.__ 
It's not an AI meme created by chatgpt. 
It's not a copy of any dog or cat, and it's not one of the hundreds of Pepe derivatives. 
All of $Hege's original content comes out from our graphic designer Dev, the illustrations and memes are fire, and we're working on series of Hege shorts and GIFs. But all this content is QUALITY content, original content with a differentiated and eye-catching style. Memes and shorts are also produced by different animators and designers in the community, contributing to keeping the project original. No AI low effort content.

The Dev and Team have been working on Hege relentlessly since launch two months ago. We brought Hege to 8 millions with 3k holders in a fully organic way, community led, with close to no marketing. No big influencers, no big names, no celebs. The Hege-fam alone brought Hege extremely close to 10mil on his first leg up.

Now the consolidation is ending and the breakout is close, and we are double the holders as then.
We have more than 3900(!) Telegram group Members over those 5000 holders. We have a Discord server and a X account with 3500+ followers. Hege is simply not stopping, our numbers are growing daily, and once the accumulation phase is over we'll see fireworks.

Why would a new investor buy into Hege?

__Because we have HUGE upside potential, still being at 4.2 millions MC, while also having showed that we are solid, rug-proof, and here to stay.__

__Because we have more original graphics and content than ANY other Coin at this MC, and of most coins on the 50-500mil MC range.__

__Because we have the same liquidity pool as $BRETT (500millions market cap) with a 100 times lower market cap. Whales are watching.__

__Because we have an online shop with QUALITY merch with all profits going in our marketing fund.__

__Because Dev never sold a cent, is as hard-working as ever, and keeps creating new content every week, even listening to requests from the community.__

__Because we have a winning narrative, the underdog narrative.__ 
We are here for all the rugged, the losers, the poor, the exploited. Hege is all of them. Hege is a beacon of light, has the cleanest ethics in the Solana memecoin minefield, is scam-free and is not backed by shady influencers waiting to dump on you. 
Hege is like we all once where. Broke, desperate, looking for love. And we are gonna give him the life he deserves. We'll make him the biggest memecoin, and we'll show all the non-believers that a wholesome, honest crypto space is possible.

Join quality. Join commitment. Join hard work.

__Join the $Hege-Fund!__

With the intention of an anti-rug memecoin this founder is aiming to give back to his investors much more than just a safe meme experience. Already providing .1 sol per week to LP providers over 500$ they are growing quickly!

$Odie was created to be educational and fun. The DEV wanted workers and the grinders to feel safe coming to Odie for an investment not just a pump and dump trade. He is looking to provide real value with many real revenue generating plans. Dev comes from a real life background of running 100 million dollar projects is aiming to navigate throught the crypto space with an underdog! 

Giving back to rugged communities is ongoing, as the dev has placed funds from his own pocket back into others. This aligns with his goal of restoring faith in crypto projects and being the change he wanted to see! He wants to view crypto as an investment not insiders capitalizing on hard workers money. 

With an NFT project that may be a game changer to solana and a trustwothy solid group moving it, its worth a closer look. Ok, so talk is cheap. Lets take a look...

Missed on $BONK $WIF $SILLY ?  
We've had a nice pump on the last token I've posted and I went back to digging. This token differentiates itself so much from the other meme tokens on the market and along with the very active community despite the low times its had, their memes keep coming with numerous twitter posts daily and it looks like it should be make a very nice movement very soon.   
IMO, with the amount of persistence that the dev and community is pouring in the project despite its harder times really show the commitment similar to what most of those tokens that did really well.  
If it can reach just 1 million MC, that's already 50x from our current price, 100x @ 2 million, and 250x at 5 million and definitely has room for more!

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Dwake on sol | 6 days old | found floor at 450k mcap | doxxed team | collabs and marketing in the works $DWAKE,"**Is Drake the Key to Making Memecoin History in 2024?**  
  
A community-driven decentralized meme token that caricatures Drake.  
  
The goal? Make this the biggest memecoin of 2024.  
  
**The Launch**  
  
The token was launched on April 30th and managed to trend as the number one trend on Dexscreener with a launch on Pumpfun.  
  
No paid promoters or solicitations, with a total of 1500 holders.  
  
Only organic growth.  
  
**Ecosystem**  
  
Led by Based Devs, $DWAKE introduced a stable investment opportunity via a Stealth Launch, making market waves.  
  
Thriving on Solana, the project flourishes through active community engagement and token holder contributions.  
  
**Backstory**  
  
The devs started the $DWAKE coin because he was tired of being rugged & asked a friend to create the website and here we are, DWAKE is born!  
  
Holding only 0.07% of the supply, the rug is out of reach.  
  
Everything is in the hands of the community.  
  
**Community**  
  
The community is strong with over 2000 members in the Telegram.  
  
Constantly at the top of the telegram raiding leaderboard.  
  
Over 100 members in the meme channel.  
  
The community is made up of invested and humorous individuals.  
  
**Events**  
  
As seen just before, the community is very active, with constant video calls and plenty of organized events.  
  
Rap battles, push-up contests, and a lot more going on.  
  
I haven't laughed this much in ages. Isn't that the real goal of meme coins, right?  
  
**Alpha**  
  
What if, like you and me, some people find pleasure in this community?  
  
Sometimes, individuals with more influence dip their toes into the game.  
  
Owner of Graffiti Mansion Izadi, who has 2.5 million followers on Instagram.  
  
He promises to put $DWAKE on his Instagram if $DWAKE hits a $2 million market cap.  
  
**Drake**  
  
The IP of $DWAKE is related to the biggest rapper in the rap game. Everyone knows about Drake.  
  
Growth potential is exponential.  
  
And just imagine if Drake stumbled upon it. I can't even fathom how crazy that would be.  
  
Lots of planned upcoming collabs with other projects and influencers.  
  
**The Dev**  
  
The dev's name is SnizzyOTB, and he's a multi-platinum Grammy-nominated producer who has worked with Lil Wayne, 21 Savage, and many other notable artists.  
  
He produced the song ""Nightmares of the Bottom"" with Lil Wayne.  
  
His contact list in the music industry is vast.  
  
**To summarize**  
  
This project has a strong foundation to grow its community with a powerful IP that appeals to everyone, an engaged community.  
  
The developer's contact network can truly make a difference and send the project to the moon.  
  
Come vibe with us on TG.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots, Day 4 Update! $SBC Sol Bets Casino on $SOL,"
Welcome back for another exciting update on $SBC (Sol Bets Casino)! Today marks the fourth day of our journey, and things are looking more bullish than ever.

**Day 1 Recap:**  
If you're just joining us, check out our initial post where we introduced $SBC and discussed its potential [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMars/comments/1bgji7s/sbc_sol_bets_casino_the_next_big_thing_on_solana/). We started with a modest market cap of 35k, setting the stage for what has become an incredible journey.

**Day 2 Highlights:**  
We witnessed remarkable growth as $SBC's market cap surged to 185k, demonstrating the project's promising trajectory.

**Day 3 Developments:**  
Yesterday, we saw another surge in our market cap, hitting a healthy 200k. The integration of socials on Dexscreener fueled this growth, reflecting the increasing recognition of $SBC within the Solana community.

**Day 4 Updates:**  
Today, despite the overall downturn in the crypto market, $SBC continues to stand strong with a market cap of 100k. This healthy consolidation is a testament to the resilience of our project, even in challenging times.  
Exciting news: We received a reply on our CMC listing application, indicating that it's in the works. This is a significant milestone that will further enhance $SBC's visibility and accessibility to a wider audience.  
Additionally, we're actively working on collaborations to integrate other coins into our casino, expanding the utility and appeal of $SBC even further.

**Calculating Potential Gains:**  
For those who joined us on day 1, let's calculate the potential gains:  
Initial Investment: $100  
Initial Market Cap: $35,000  
Current Market Cap: $100,000  
Gains ≈ 185.71%  
Therefore, if you invested $100 on day 1, you would now be sitting on gains of approximately $185.71, resulting in a total portfolio value of approximately $285.71.

**Looking Ahead:**  
With our market cap steadily growing, exciting collaborations on the horizon, progress on our CMC listing, and ongoing development efforts, the future of $SBC looks brighter than ever.

NFTs - Buy/Sell your fancy usernames as an NFT. There will also be a BullVerse NFT mint at a later date with value provided to NFT holders.

This utility token is sitting at around 370k and is holding a solid floor. In my opinion this is a solid, safe long-term project. I can see this fly within the next weeks/months if the team manages to play their cards right, which they have done up until now.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,KittenWifHat (KITTENWIF) : 4500 SOL Already Raised on Pinksale | Dont Miss Your Last Chance,"Greetings, crypto enthusiasts! I'm excited to introduce KittenWifHat (KITTENWIF), a new, community-driven coin that's gearing up to be the next major success on the Solana blockchain. Our project draws on the experience of the same team behind Baby BNB, which saw a staggering 330x growth from its presale price, skyrocketing from $60K to $22M. Our team is committed to transparency and security, demonstrated by being the first Solana project to receive a full suite of PinkSale badges: Doxxed team, SAFU, KYC, Audit, and AMA sessions.  
  
We've allocated over $200K to our marketing efforts to ensure KittenWifHat makes a splash across key platforms such as GECKOTERMINAL, DEXVIEW, DEXTOOLS, and AVEDEX upon launch. Additionally, we're on the fast track for listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, with planned listings on BitMart and MEXC to expand our reach.  
  
What sets KittenWifHat apart? Aside from our engaging theme and experienced team, we've ensured there are no buy or sell fees to make transactions as straightforward as possible. Liquidity is a priority for us; 60% of LP tokens are locked for one year to stabilize and secure our market presence.  
  
Interested in getting involved? The soft cap for our project is set at 5 SOL, with a maximum buy limit also at 5 SOL, making it accessible for a wide range of investors. You can find more information and stay updated through our website and social media channels:

Our contract address is: 9a8AmDfQxFJ44RrVhKdiXnkwCWT99igWp5QrRuC73Pin. For those interested in our presale, details can be found on PinkSale's launchpad.  
  
We're not just another coin; we're a movement. Join us as we take the crypto world by storm, one kitten with a hat at a time. Let's embark on this journey together and make KittenWifHat the purr-fect success story!",64,2024-04-10 09:51:35,2
SOL,CryptoMoonShots,420 Blaze It on sol | $WEED | 50k mcap | great opportunity | good narrative,"$WEED 420 Coin Headed For $420M MC by 4/20 (currently $16K MC, 25000X Moonshot Potential)

I’ve been researching 4/20 meme coins over the last day as I’m sure at least one will pump significantly in the next couple of days, in the run up to the annual 4/20 smokers holiday - which also happens to coincide nicely with the bitcoin halving this year

Of all the projects out there $WEED 420 Blaze It on Solana (CA: G3bNZLjkQ1u29sJd68sCgidcdTpQZdjP8gbhiiUA2Jra) looks like the most legit community, dev and is still super low market cap at the time of writing ($15K mc).

They have an active Telegram channel and Twitter, and they plan to take over Reddit and Twitter over the next couple of days with memes that the Dev has already prepared and shared with the community.

Checked the ownership of the wallets and everything looks legit and rug-safe also, with this coin initially being launched on pump.fun (as always please DYOR)

The project went through the usual pump and dump that every new project seems to go through, but the chart has already started building back up and looks like it could be about to grow exponentially

If they get anywhere close to the planned goal of a $420 mill MC by 4/20, this would mean a 25,000X return on investment right now. So $10 to $250K.

We’ve seen so many viral meme coins lately explode to MCs above $50M with very little marketing, just capitalizing on current events.

So this seems like a great moonshot opportunity to me, and worth throwing $20 at

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$HEGE Announces BIG Future Plans Including Marketing Push Next Week,"HEGE launched 4 months ago raising approximately 150 SOL from presales at a MC of $60k. With that raise, 7.5 SOL was kept for initial marketing and the rest was deposited into the Liquidity Pool. The tokenomics were 50% to presales, 45% to LP, and 5% to dev.

Off of that, the project has put together a great team and an amazing community that has contributed \~$250,000 USD for various fundraises. Like the early days of PONKE and other large MC memecoins, HEGE has gone through pump periods where the price 5-10x'es in a week and periods of consolidation where the price is rangebound for several weeks. These periods of consolidation are necessary to shake out short term traders in order to clear the skies for a big pump when the next catalyst comes.

HEGE, sitting at $10m MC with an all-time high of $30m MC has shaken out short term traders and profit takers. The vibe in the community feels like the last few times before the price 10Xed in a matter of a week and all that is need now is a catalyst.

That catalyst is here now. The details are in the team's recently released 13 page document which you can find below.

🌐 [https://x.com/HegeCoin/status/1818402736083292234](https://x.com/HegeCoin/status/1818402736083292234)

**However, the summary is the following:**

* Collaborations. There are a few collaborations in the works including one that if you hold HEGE you will get an airdrop from another project that raised $4 million USD and is valued at $40 million USD.

* Team has studied PONKE's success with animations and engagement and will be applying lessons learned from that research

* Team is upsizing content and has onboarded 4 more animators who in addition to the other designers and animators will be creating content for HEGE nonstop. A weekly news show HNN (Hege News Network) using our digital controllable puppet week also started last week

* Project is focusing on spinning up YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram to reach holders who have never heard of HEGE before. Just started posting to YouTube this week and have gotten over 15,000 views thus far!

* BIG marketing push starting on Monday! Last marketing pushes have been catalysts for big pumps

*  Bringing HEGE into the real world

*  $2000 sticker contest for best real world HEGE sticker location. Over 15,000 stickers have been ordered thus far

*  A custom HEGE painted RV will be touring the United States starting next week and lasting 2 months (Red Bull Marketing style). It will be visiting hot areas like the Las Vegas Strip, Santa Monica Pier, National Parks, etc



As with any investment please do your own research. In addition to the released document above, checkout the X as a survey of the content and the Telegram channel for a sense of the community.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$LMEOW on SOL | Prev ATH 2.5M | GCR meta | Great beta play to Eth (14.5M),"Hey guys

So I’m sure you’ve heard and or seen the now famous GCR post of waiting for a cat coin called $LMEOW.

Although one exists on Eth, this one was launched on Solana to challenge the inherent laziness of the Eth version, with the idea it is not worthy of being the “official” GCR token. 

Launched on pump.fun in March, there is clearly a demand for a quality $lmeow coin on SOL as this went to 2.5M almost overnight (no paid callers, no paid trending, all 100% organic). It was only due to one person who bought a large amount of supply while on pump (not the devs) that dumped the token and with it, the price.

Devs are doxxed and have never sold a token. Wallets with holdings are publicly available. Consistent posts on Twitter and TikTok.

$LMEOW on sol is inherently anti influencer. It simply wants to embody GCR’s vision of being a based cat coin that lmeows the timeline.

Devs also host weekly spaces and are working hard on partnerships with other coins ($CIGGS and $GCR on Solana so far).

Definitely worth scooping a bag at current prices, especially when Eth gas goes crazy and people are scrambling for Solana alternatives.

Finally, given it’s pump origins and meta, has the potential to do a $michi or $sc type run.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Pepe on Sol | update ATH | ticker $PEPE | the flippening is real | ATH 20m | 1.2m mcap dip | bottomed out | rising floor,"Hey fellow crypto enthusiasts,  
  
I wanted to kickstart a discussion about something that's been buzzing in the crypto sphere lately: Pepe on Solana, with the ticker $PEPE. This little frog has been hopping around Ethereum for a while now, with a market cap of around 400 million and a peak market cap of 1.4 billion. But guess what? We're eyeing a flip to Solana, and here's why it's got potential:  
  
🌟 Strong Community: First things first, let's talk about the community. The $PEPE gang on Ethereum has been nothing short of amazing, with meme creators, investors, and tech enthusiasts all joining forces. And now, with the move to Solana, we're ready to expand and explore new horizons together.  
  
💡 No Dev to Dump on Us: One of the things that bugs us all in the crypto world is devs holding a ton of tokens, ready to dump them on unsuspecting investors. Well, fear not, because in the world of $PEPE on Solana, there are no devs waiting to rain on our parade. It's a fair game, and that's something we can all get behind.  
  
🎯 Early Snipers Out, New Opportunities In: You know how it goes—early investors come and go, making their quick gains and leaving the rest of us wondering what's next. But with $PEPE's move to Solana, most of those early snipers have already made their moves. That means there's a fresh wave of opportunities for us to dive into.  
  
🎨 Memes Galore: Let's not forget the memes! They've always been a big part of the crypto culture, and with $PEPE on Solana, the memes are already flowing. From hilarious artwork to playful jokes, the creativity of this community knows no bounds.  
  
🔥 Solana vs Ethereum Pepes: Now, here's where it gets interesting. As the crypto market heats up, the battle between Solana and Ethereum Pepes is heating up too. While Ethereum has its strengths, Solana offers scalability and speed like no other. It's a showdown we're all eager to watch unfold.  
  
So, what do you think? Are you ready to join the $PEPE movement on Solana? Let's hear your thoughts, fellow hodlers. We're in this for the long haul, and together, we'll ride the waves of the crypto market like true champions. 🚀🐸

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,MOTHER IGGY: The Explosive SOL Chain Memecoin Endorsed by Iggy Azalea,"MOTHER IGGY, a new memecoin on the Solana (SOL) blockchain, has taken the crypto world by storm. Endorsed by the famous rapper Iggy Azalea, this token has shown an unprecedented rise in value since its market debut. Launched on May 29, 2024, MOTHER experienced a dramatic surge, reaching an all-time high shortly after its introduction. Following Caitlyn Jenner's pioneering move into the crypto space, MOTHER became the second celebrity-linked cryptocurrency on the Solana blockchain.

Starting with a modest market cap of less than $50,000, MOTHER's market cap soared to $16.6 million in a short period. By June 2, 2024, just days after its launch, the token hit an all-time high price of $0.08952 with a market cap of $88.7 million. Currently, MOTHER boasts a market cap exceeding $105 million, with a trading volume of $72.93 million in the last 24 hours. The token has performed over 300x since its launch and is now trading at $0.1202.

Iggy Azalea has been actively engaging with the Crypto Twitter community, adopting a custom Mad Lads profile picture on June 1, 2024, a day after the Solana project released a custom honorary avatar for her based on a photo reference. Mad Lads, the most valuable Solana NFT collection, is currently valued at a floor price of 62.83 SOL, or $10,434.72. Azalea’s involvement with this collection highlights her deep engagement with the Solana ecosystem.

On-chain data indicates that there are over 18,273 holders of the MOTHER token, demonstrating a substantial community for a newly-launched token. MOTHER ranks in the top 3 in terms of trading volume on the Solana blockchain, with a 24-hour trading volume reaching $23 million. The token’s holder base is growing rapidly, positioning it to potentially replicate the success of other Solana-based meme tokens. The consistent rise in token price and an on-chain liquidity pool of $3.4 million make MOTHER an attractive investment for market participants. The potential for wealth creation continues to draw market funds.

The token has gained significant attention thanks to Iggy Azalea’s endorsement and active promotion by key opinion leaders (KOLs) in both the Chinese and English-speaking communities. The enthusiasm among Azalea’s fan base adds to the token’s appeal. Furthermore, MOTHER has been listed on Bitget, presenting an early opportunity for investors to capitalize on this trending project and potentially reap significant returns. Seize the opportunity to invest in MOTHER IGGY, a token that combines the power of celebrity endorsement with the innovative Solana blockchain, promising substantial returns and a thriving community.",2,2024-06-06 05:51:33,2
SOL,CryptoMoonShots,"Insider Nets $5.6M by Selling $DADDY Tokens for $SOL
","**An Insider Trades $DADDY Tokens for $SOL Coins to Gain Profits**

In its recent post on X, the analytics provider noted that the cost of the insider was even less than just $2K. According to Lookonchain, the respective event resulted in a significant gain for the insider. It added that, before the initial post that the CTO of Daddy published, the insider had spent just 13.2 $SOL. The respective tokens had a value of nearly $1,950. The insider reportedly used them to purchase 29.8 million $DADDY coins.

[Lookonchain](https://lookonchain.com/) brought to the front that the insider carried out this move through three wallets. Following that, the insider traded a minor amount. In addition to this, the insider transacted the majority thereof via several addresses several times. The respective tokens ultimately moved to “DpL2Tm.” Nearly 18 hours back, the insider reportedly transacted $DADDY coins in a big amount to unique wallets and began selling.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$DuckMe | Presale Reached 50 Sol,"$DUCKME…. Gearing up for an amazing launch on 4/20… The project has already been audited by BlockSafu (Links Below).

I really think this coin will explode and become a absolute gem.. This project has such cool art and has great “NFT” capabilities when you look at the DuckMe Character and its art it just screams NFT, MEME, CUTE, LOVING. People love ducks. This project also features cartoony animated episodes which can be found on the website. This episode tactic feels perfect for meme coin community adoption as well as collab’s with other meme coins and communities. 

The community is growing steadily and organically while it anxiously waits to be listed on pink-sale to increase its number of SOL. They are currently working on their 3rd episode to be used as an introduction video which is required by pink-sale. They are planning something special during launch which is set for 4/20 the magical number to many people. 

The current presale amount just reached 50 Sol with 2 weeks left until launch. I say this is a gem waiting to explode and really become the next “BIG” Meme coin that people can 10-100x. 

DuckMe Presale is still ongoing so I recommend joining the Flock, become a Ducker, and quack all the way to the moon.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$SMURF on SOL might just be the memecoin to match Smurfcat's potential. Holding strong near 145k after 4 days.,"The hashtag smurfcat has over 3.4 billion views on TikTok, and it's Russian counterpart шайлушай has an additional 1.1 billion TikTok views. Memecoins on Solana tend to do there best after the creators have sold and a community takeover comes and establishes a strong floor. 

There are some strong communities involved that have a history of running up projects just like this. This is in a spot that many whales are watching for, some waiting for a higher market cap before jumping in. Considering some of the strongest meme coins (Pepe, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin) had similar roots and the current market movements, I believe this to be very worthy of a Crypto Moon Shot.

$SMURF on SOL is sitting at a $152K market cap and I have definitely gotten myself a bag. 

He is real. 



I need more characters for this post so feel free to skip over this text. There is an ETH Smurf cat, that hasn't met nearly as much success. In my opinion that's because it stopped operating out of the meme space. None of the most successful meme coins have attachment to a team, they are ran by the community. I think this has a much better shot at reaching the highs that you would want in a good meme coin. Especially with a good bull run on the horizon.",12,2024-02-16 18:46:09,10

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,SMURF on SOL has massive potential,"After the community takeover, it went from $20k MC to an ATH of $1.3M. Everyone is talking about it on Twitter and has been recognized by major influencers  
  
To further breakdown its price trend after the community takeover, it went from $20k to a high of $500k before dipping to a low of $100k, and then reached a new ATH of $1.3M before dipping to $200k. After its $200k bottom, it quickly did a V shaped recovery and reached $400k in just a few hours. Following the price trend, it’s around its current bottom and gearing up for another moonshot.  
  
As some of you know, the crypto's team and community affect the price, so here is what goes on with the SMURF team and community.

1. The TG community (link below) is extremely committed to raiding X. They've consistently fulfilled raids with 40 likes and even got one with 97 likes in just 5 minutes!
2. The leads have a work ethic of their own. Look at the website linked below and you'll see what I mean; it is one of the most aesthetically pleasing crypto websites you will come across. You can find the link to their website on their X, SmurfCat\_IsReal.
3. Owning 5 million tokens allows you to join SMURF's team where you learn what goes on behind the scenes, what their short and long-term plans are, and you also get to voice any ideas you have that would increase the crypto's value! You'll also learn what to look for when investing in future crypto!  
  
They're also applying for Coin Market Cap listing (which you can confirm on their X), so buy in now or get left behind!",22,2024-02-24 04:57:07,8

11 Feb 00:00 - 12 Feb 00:00 (GMT +1)  
We will reveal the wallet to which you will be able to send your funds when the presale starts.  
There will be 7 different tiers you can invest in.  
0.1 SOL  
0.25 SOL  
0.50 SOL  
1 SOL  
2.5 SOL  
5 SOL  
10 SOL  
Don't send any other amount than the 7 listed above.  
You can do multiple transactions in different tiers. DO NOT EXCEED THE 10 SOL limit.   
So if you want to invest 3,5 SOL you invest 2,5 in one transaction, and 1 SOL in another transaction.   
In case you participate with another number, we round down and go with that tier.   
No refunds will be given.   
In case you want to have a bigger $Notwork bag.  
The listing price will be 5% higher than the presale, please respect the community and invest after the presale on the open market. 

After the Pre-sale concludes there will be a period in which we verify the transactions.  
This will be to ensure that no-one uses multiple wallets to buy in with more than 10 SOL.   
In case you try to do this and we find out, we will use any funds above 10 SOL to fund the treasury.   
After this verification period we are safe from whales, $Notwork is distributed to all participants based on their contribution.   
All revenue from the pre sale minus the fees will be used to create liquidity on Raydium.  
When we launch there will be a big opportunity for liquidity providers.  
The initial emissions will be large and unsustainable for the first months after which you vote on the new emissions!

We kicked off with a modest market cap of 35k, setting the stage for the incredible journey ahead.

**Day 2 Highlights:** We witnessed remarkable growth as $SBC's market cap surged to 185k, showcasing the project's promising trajectory.

**Day 3 Developments:** With a surge in our market cap to a healthy 200k, fueled by the integration of socials on Dexscreener, $SBC continued to gain recognition within the Solana community.

**Day 4 Updates:** Despite the crypto market downturn, $SBC stood strong with a market cap of 100k, demonstrating resilience and stability.

**Day 5 Highlights:** Today, $SBC has reached another milestone with a market cap of 365k! This impressive growth is a testament to the project's potential and the dedication of our community.

Exciting news: We received a significant endorsement from Crypto Moon Shots, indicating a willingness to invest in marketing efforts. This demonstrates our team's commitment to promoting $SBC and reaching a wider audience.

Additionally, our betting volume hit almost 1.8k today, showcasing the high usage of our casino platform. This bodes well for the revenue split for hodlers, promising lucrative rewards for our supporters.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,We changed from SOL to BASE. Gulp launching next week and presale only 4 days. Dont be a loser.,"Listen up, future legends and skeptics alike—it’s your main cup, Gulp, here, splashing into your world with an opportunity that’s too juicy to pass up. We’re not just moving; we’re making monumental waves by launching on Base. Why? Because it’s where the magic happens, where the real gamers play, and where Gulp becomes more than a token—it becomes a legacy.  
  
Let’s get one thing crystal clear: the Gulp dev is doxxed. That’s right, no shadows here. We’re all about transparency, trust, and a little bit of that bold 90s bravado. Because hiding? That’s for the arcade era’s final bosses, not us.  
  
Now, for the real kicker: the first 1,000 presale pioneers get something that money later on won’t buy—the Founder Edition NFT, waiting for you at Level 2. This isn’t just an NFT; it’s your VIP pass to history, your badge of honor showing you saw the potential before Gulp became the name on every digital lip.  
  
So, here’s the deal: You can sit back, watch from the sidelines, and let the future pass you by. Or, you can grab your destiny by the joystick and join us on this journey to the top. Miss out now, and you’re not just missing a token; you’re missing out on becoming part of a brand set to redefine what crypto can do.  
  
Are you going to be a part of the crowd watching us in awe, wishing you’d hit that buy button? Or are you going to stand with us, a proud owner of a Founder Edition NFT, and say, 'I was there when Gulp changed the game'?  
  
The choice is yours, but remember—only losers sit this one out. Let’s make history together. Are you in, or are you out?

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,"Wife Changing Money from SOL, now on Base","Wife Changing Money - a potential moonshot

&#x200B;

Yo, crypto fam! You heard about Wife Changing Money (WCM)? It's the memecoin from the same dev of the memecoin with the same name but on SOL.

&#x200B;

Why it can be a moonshot?

&#x200B;

1. Dev is well-known by his last successful token on SOL.

2. We have a website, telegram, twitter.  All inclusive!

3. Base is a much more stable blockchain for memecoins. More holders than jeets.

4. Dev pays for marketing. He did updated dexscreener, dextools, geckoterminal, base trending, moontok listing, and keeps his hands on shilling.

5. Ticker is $WIFE. Sounds nice and easy to remember.

&#x200B;

Why Base?

&#x200B;

Base is the new kid on the block from Coinbase, and it's gonna be huge! It's fast, cheap, and perfect for memecoins like WCM. So, get ready to witness WCM soar like a majestic eagle!

&#x200B;

The Community

&#x200B;

WCM has a tight-knit community of diamond-handed hodlers. They're the best in the biz, always pumping WCM to the moon! Together, they're gonna make WCM the next big thing in crypto.

&#x200B;

So, What's the Catch?

&#x200B;

There ain't none! WCM is a pure-play memecoin. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. It's just here to make you laugh and make you money.

&#x200B;

How to Get Your Hands on WCM

&#x200B;

Head over to your favorite crypto exchange and grab some ETH and swap it for WCM on uniswap exchange. Just remember, this is a memecoin, so invest only what you're willing to lose. But hey, if you miss out, you'll be the one crying into your pillow!

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,HEGE Prepares for another CEX Listing,"In early June, Hege went down the path of listing on various centralized exchanges. This made sense at the time, because the Crypto market was hot in the summer and cooled down late summer into the fall. Many projects continued to list on CEX’s at this time with limited success. 
 
With the US elections finalized, and SOL exploding in growth, rising up to $240, the market is clearly heating up again for the better. Money has been moving into new launches, but the tide is slowly turning to tokens that have solid foundations and charts trending towards explosive movements. 
 
Facts about $HEGE 
 
 1. Still run by the OG Hege DEv 
 2. Launched in april at 57K MC, ATH 30M MC, currently consolidating in the 7M range 
 3. Listed on Mexc, Toobit, Bitmart, SuperX 
 4. 24K X followers, 1.8K Reddit, 1K IG and Tik Tok, 9K YT 
 5. Community funded, meets all criteria of Murad’s definition of a cult Meme coin 
 
As always DYOR, but HegeCoin in my opinion has proved time and time again they are here to stay and could be potential leaders of this bull run.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$Fofar (0x71) Will Be Listed on BitMart Tomorrow!,"How often do you see a $2 million market cap memecoin get listed on the 18th largest centralized exchange (CEX)? It does not happen every day, and when it does, you can bet it's bullish! BitMart, a highly respected and reputable CEX, has an astonishing 540 million USD of average daily volume. This listing will significantly increase exposure and trading volume for Fofar, opening the door for even more opportunities on larger and more known CEXs.

Furthermore, certain Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) won't partner with memecoins unless they have a proven and trustworthy community. Being listed on BitMart means that Fofar's community is strong and dedicated... or it simply indicates substantial backing from [**significant players**](https://debank.com/profile/0x6bEf22A76391E16E9d577b5a386Cf97bA39D88F7)**.** Either way, it works in Fofars favour.

Not only is Fofar set to be listed on BitMart, but some [investors](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5fa2811b4126fd561b6c8f8ebf1a52c3ab6d41a7) are so bullish on its potential that they have sold their holdings in Andy, Birddog, Turbo, and Wolf to accumulate more Fofar, a memecoin that offers a highly appealing risk-reward potential.

Additionally, Fofar's [community marketing wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5fa2811b4126fd561b6c8f8ebf1a52c3ab6d41a7) still holds 7.5 billion coins, worth $40,000 USD, an incredible amount for such a small market cap memecoin. The BitMart listing is just the first domino to fall, marking the beginning of an incredible journey for Fofar to join the other Boys Club memecoins at the $100 million+ market cap table. Where will we see Fofar next?

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Kendu inu - Entry for generational wealth ,"Gm chads.

$KENDU (ETH) is setting up for a massive run the likes crypto hasn't seen since Shiba Inu. The Army has been building for 9 solid months and engagement is off the charts. 

Search 'KENDU' on the recent tab on X and you will see the activity is on another level and a night and day difference between other highly praised ""community cult coins""

1.5 million monthly impressions on X and rising, all with no cabals, no influencers pumping or dumping. And no paid KOLs. 

Miazaki said, ""would you rather be the person who got lucky on a meme coin, or be the person who was pivotal in building a multi billion dollar project from the ground up?""

Some alpha is our Dev, Miazaki, will have a KENDU booth set up at Shibcon in Dubai this December and will also be presenting on stage. He is a Shib OG whale with alot of connections in that community (followed by Shytoshi Kusama on X, Shib lead dev). 

In addition, We have hit an ATH of 280mil back in the summer with only ~7000 holders and have since then retraced to 30mil mcap but have doubled the holders in that time now at ~14800 holders. This means that 55%+ of the supply has been redistributed since ATH which hardens and strengthens the project.  Chads show up everyday to work and the vibe is incredibly good with a focus on the eye on the prize.

Now is an unbelievably good entry to ride this bull the entire cycle with targets to 100B mcap this cycle. See you on the fffn MOON! Join the pack at www.kenduinu.com 

There you will find all of our projects within the ecosystem and also our telegram which has over 10k members. Very active!

With over 20 million social media followers and an astounding 1.6 billion views on YouTube, Simon’s Cat has become a cultural phenomenon, celebrated for its charming depiction of feline antics and relatable humor.




$CAT is the official memecoin of the Simon's Cat Ecosystem and will be integrated and promoted extensively through official Simon's Cat channels. $CAT will also contribute to feeding and saving cats around the world.



$CAT is the world's most popular cat memecoin due to its strong association with the Simon's Cat brand and IP!

Additionally, the $CAT project is supported by the BNB Chain and several major exchanges, further solidifying its credibility and reach.



Why $CAT Stands Out:



 • Strong Brand Connection: $CAT benefits from its association with Simon’s Cat, ensuring a robust community and widespread recognition.


 • Charitable Impact: A portion of every transaction will be dedicated to helping cats globally, making each investment meaningful.


 • Extensive Promotion: $CAT already  featured across Simon’s Cat’s official channels, ensuring broad visibility and community engagement.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$RAVE : A Project That Started As A Reddit-Post,"There are very few Crypto projects that can claim to be 100% community driven and inspired. Now the Solana network has it's first, truly community inspired coin... $RAVE

$RAVE is a brand new 100% community driven token ,only on the #Solana network.

$RAVE is just 2 weeks old since conception from a single Reddit post and the Telegram community has already grown to over 1000 members. The pace of $RAVE's project and impending launch are just one example of why $RAVE has so much potential.

There are no restrictions on ideas and possibilities in a community project such as this. With ideas and decisions coming directly from the community, the ideas can be put into action far sooner than any 'planned' project could adapt.

This adaptability is something that really gives $RAVE (and a very small handful of other projects on other networks) a REAL future, with utility and community always at the very forefront of development.

The #RAVE token launched on Solana less than 50 hours ago and since launch, $RAVE has been exceeding expectations, reaching 5 times the starting price several times.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$HEGE on Solana | 2 Week Post Launch Update,"After raising 150 SOL pre-launch, hitting a high of $2.1 mil MC hours after launch, $HEGE found a floor at $200k MC before organically rising to the ~$1.3 mil MC today, reflecting the organic growth of the community.

$HEGE is a meme of a hedgehog with a story and a cast of supporting characters (explained on the website). This is a unique meme (and not just the thousandth dog, cat, frog, elon, etc copycat) where its graphics are carefully crafted by graphic designers on the team and not just shoved into an AI generator. This care and meticulousness shows and requires tons of work, but the team is relentless. The results of their efforts and the community's efforts show up in all areas of this project and has led to a top notch community with top notch contributors.

As the community grows and starts to compound (over 20x users in Telegram and over 15x followers on Twitter since launch), the price of $HEGE has also followed. This project is now starting to gain traction and get the attention of a larger audience with more significant influencers taking notice and is poised to have a major upside breakout.

The community, the comradery, and the laughs have been great, but nothing beats the potential of a huge return.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,the next Matt Furie character to moon will be GREMLY from 'The Night Riders' with a proven team and whales from other huge projects about to start marketing. Facts:,"Matt Furie characters such as Pepe, Brett, Andy and LandWolf obviously rule the meme token space and always will. The newest meta-within-the-meta lately has been the recent rise of 'The Night Riders', a beloved book Matt Furie wrote for children. (Though us grown-ups think its fucking dope too). Night Rider characters have been blowing up lately, such as Draggy, Flappy, Wat and Hoppy, all floating between 7 to 70million MC. 

Gremly appears in Night Riders, and was just launched last week, so still under 2 mill, very solid considering it launched in a downtrend. Many of the same team members are involved with Nitefeeder, who appears in both Boy's Club as Pepe's pet and The Night Riders, and Nitefeeder is another Night Rider character at 7million MC... 

Gremly is only a few days old, so will soon hit the 7mill floor like the rest of 'The Night Riders' characters, maybe 70mill like some of them.

I don't post about a lot of projects - I'm one of the few people on Reddit who posts under my real name, because I'm proud to have a solid reputation in both Hollywood and the crypto space - I write movies and TV shows and contribute creatively to various projects that are built around great art AND offer a unique chance to make serious gains. Sure, I'm an artist, but I also enjoy financial freedom and I get that from crypto projects when they moon. This will be a big one--- Kendu whale (top 3 wallet) turned me on to this. Nearly all my huge gains in this new bull market (and the last) has been from people with large portfolios telling me where the big money is about to flow. True story. Kinda like Hollywood, who ya know helps a lot.

Hop in the telegram to catch the vibe--- running gag is that Gremly is mysterious and mischievious but fun--- don't we all kinda wanna be that way? Maybe I'm just an aging nerd who likes dorky things. But I have a good eye for these things, and a good ear, because I listen to what other whales whisper in my ear.

P.S. if you are usually a SOL investor, and you avoided ETH because gas fees were always 20-50 bucks a trade, that's all changed--- update in the chain has changed gas fees, now only 2-5 dollars. so while ETH used to be 'whales only', now its whales as well as anyone else who wants to join----- i find SOL projects people are quick to jeet, versus ETH projects, holders put in more money and hold longer, as its not their only hundred bucks, ya know? SOL kinda sucks lately, try ETH.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,🔥Panda Multiverse🔥 | 🚨FPS P2E GAME 🚨| 💰Free NFT Giveaway💰 |,"  

🔥Panda Multiverse🔥 | 🚨FPS P2E GAME 🚨| 💰Free NFT Giveaway💰 | 

We are a devoted, doxed, and professional team working together for the first time on the same project. This is our first token launch as token owners. We have previously worked on multiple teams assisting with marketing, listings, and community leadership positions, but we are now achieving our aspirations of operating our own business. We have responsibilities in several renowned cryptocurrency groups and decided it was time to unite all of our efforts and create something extraordinary.

The Panda Multiverse is first and foremost about its community and our commitment to helping one another, as well as our passion for Pandas!

Aside from that, we are a reward token that pays out 1% BUSD to token holders and 4% BUSD to token holders who also own one of our BSC NFTs (with the ability to bridge the others).

We are a cross-chain NFT platform that has an FPS P2E Zombie Panda game that rewards in legendary NFT pieces. We're also collaborating with other tokens to create their NFTs, giving further income and publicity back to the Panda multiverse. 

Tokenomics

2% LP

6% MARKETING

Holders of 4% NFT in BUSD

2% NFT HOLDERS' WEEKLY PAYDAY

1% DEV

We have announced a new collaboration with FarmerDoge!

We'll be performing their next NFTs alongside the great musician himself!

In addition, FarmerDoge will be cultivating Panda Multi-verse in the near future, which will bring us massive volume and new holders only from this collaboration!

We've also recently announced that each new investor who purchases a $50 minimum will receive a complimentary limited edition 8bit Panda NFT!

Where else can you buy a tiny quantity of tokens and receive an NFT as a welcome gift?

Panda Multiverse is continually rewarding its fans with gifts and games based on our own Telegram and Discord communities!

Our cross-chain NFT sales and ability to bridge them help us separate from other typical initiatives. And our FPS P2E Zombie Pandas game is on a completely different level of professionalism; it is nothing short of spectacular! This is a must-play for both gamers and crypto aficionados! Our game will include branding and marketing as though it were its own metaverse that changes over time. One of our more ambitious aims (you heard it here first) is to have a Panda multi-verse NFT Temple within the TCG metaverse. More specifics coming soon. We can't provide everything at once, and of course, our NFTs are hand-created masterpieces you can only acquire within the Panda multi-verse! 

Our initial 250 NFTs on BSC sold very quickly, leaving many people wanting more.

So, as we waited for our deal to be completed, we put an extra 250 on BSC, and they sold out even faster! We sold 550 NFTs in total in the run-up to our token launch, generating additional income for marketing and assisting with liquidity. 

We are actively minting on SOL and searching for extra usefulness for SOL holders to profit from without needing to bridge back to BSC for incentives.

In addition to NFT purchases, the Panda Multiverse will generate other revenue streams through our P2E game, in which players may spend in-game money and other projects can pay to advertise in-game (2 already on board). In addition, we will offer a line of personalized clothes and one-of-a-kind shoes to help generate marketing income for the project. In addition, our NFT artists will collaborate with other projects on their NFTs, generating more revenue for the Panda Multiverse.

We're here to have a good time, trade beautiful art, form strong bonds, support the Pandas, and help one another grow as tall as the tallest bamboo! 

""In an infinite multiverse, there is no such thing as fiction."" PandaMultiverse

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Introducing $PRINT: A Revolutionary Solana Reflection Token The Biggest Step Of The Future,"What is $PRINT?  
$PRINT is a revolutionary Solana reflection token that provides passive income to holders through auto-rewards in Solana (SOL). Unlike traditional reflection tokens that rely on manual swaps, $PRINT utilizes a unique auto-swap script to convert token taxes into SOL and distribute them directly to holders’ wallets. This innovative approach ensures that holders receive their rewards seamlessly and efficiently.  
  
Key Features of $PRINT  
 • 8% Tax: $PRINT implements an 8% tax on all transactions, including transfers and swaps.  
 • 6% Auto-Rewards: 6% of the tax is distributed as auto-rewards in SOL directly to holders’ wallets.  
 • 2% Operations Wallet: The remaining 2% of the tax is allocated to the Operations Wallet, which is used to fund the development and marketing of $PRINT.  
  
How Does $PRINT Auto-Swap Work?  
The $PRINT auto-swap script operates periodically, collecting all available taxes generated through transactions and swaps. These collected $PRINT tokens are then stored in the Rewards Distribution Wallet (PrintRewards.sol).  
Once the minimum swap threshold of 1 million $PRINT is met, the script automatically swaps the tokens for SOL. 25% of the acquired SOL is sent to the Marketing Wallet (PrintMarketing.sol), while the remaining 75% is distributed proportionally to all $PRINT holders based on their holdings.  
  
Early Success of $PRINT  
$PRINT has experienced remarkable growth since its launch, attracting over 25,000 holders and generating over $17 million in trading volume. The token has also distributed over $1 million in rewards to its community.  
  
PrintPad™: Solana’s Auto Swap Tax Solution  
PrintPad™ is an upcoming Solana-powered platform that will revolutionize the way projects manage their taxes. PrintPad™ will enable developers to connect their Tax Withdrawal Authorities to the platform, allowing $PRINT’s auto-swap script to seamlessly convert their taxes into SOL and deposit them directly into their marketing wallets.  
  
Benefits of $PRINT for Project Developers  
 • Streamlined Tax Management: PrintPad™ simplifies tax management by automatically converting taxes into SOL, eliminating the need for manual swaps.  
  
 • Enhanced Rewards: 5% of all taxes collected for linked projects will be directed to an auto-buyback wallet, providing consistent buy pressure and elevating rewards for $PRINT holders.  
  
Why Choose $PRINT?  
If you’re looking for a revolutionary Solana reflection token that offers passive income, seamless auto-rewards, and a supportive community, $PRINT is the ideal choice. With its innovative auto-swap mechanism and the upcoming PrintPad™ platform, $PRINT is poised to revolutionize the Solana ecosystem.  
  
Join the $PRINT Revolution  
Get involved with the $PRINT community today and experience the power of passive income through Solana’s first auto-swap reflection token. Stay tuned for exciting developments and the launch of PrintPad™!

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Pedro - the RAVE Raccoon is here to stay - Don't just believe me - check for yourself. ,"Let me begin by saying that if you haven't seen our previous posts outlining our whole road(map), including each and every pitfall we came through, you totally should. But, here's the deal, why don't you do it after reading this post, just for verification's sake? 

Pedro, our beloved raccoon meme star is paying dear tribute to his ""momma"" Raffaella Carrà by raving to her tunes honestly, diligently, and specially with tons of fun! Does this sound absolutely impossible for a Solana project? Well, I don't blame you, I'd be thinking the same, *but*, we are here to try a different spin, erm, tune, or die trying. 

This isn't certainly the very first 100% community-driven token (a lil' secret: that's the hot sauce), but on all our platforms we strive to be as transparent as can be. In fact, this very post is an example of it, it's written by a community member who volunteered after 2 days of launch because he wasn't seeing the engagement he would like to see and wants to push for higher standards. And we, the whole team and community itself want to *encourage* every newcomer to see this, and truly gauge the underlying potential of the project, and then based on that, decide if you want to jump in, hell, why not even pitch in with ideas? 
Reddit is very much unlike other platforms in that simply by virtue of checking an account age and karma, you can easily distinguish pond scum from a good project, and we are really grateful to have been able to launch on this platform. 

*Now then*, very sorry if that introduction took a bit long. Let's get to the meaty part: 

- No matter what it takes, we are going long-term, we can't stress this enough. Our main goal is to spread positivity and foster a healthy hub for people to come, chill, hang out and well, of course, RAVE! 

- Our roadmap includes milestones such as giving to animal-related charities as major end-goals, and we want to achieve that mostly by snowballing gamification. How? By hosting community activities and events such as a poker night (we already had one a few days ago when we were about 500 members - we are over 1k now- and it was a total success), and rewarding our members in light of their contributions. Be it kick-ass memes, reels, copywriting and more. The beauty of this is that we allow the entire community to vote on what they think is best, transparency is vital to us.  

- This post is getting long enough for me to ""bore"" you right now with our tokenomics, but should you like what you've read so far, do check everything which is properly outlined on our website. Oh, and of course, have a peek at our chart where our LP to MC ratio is really strong. 

— Now then, the question is: want to hop on Pedro's wagon, erm, Lambo and help us achieve our dreams while having fun and making some money as well?

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$DOKY - a meme coin supported by Binance Top influencer - 4.3K+ Holders Right Now - Check Out Our Binance Article,"The world of cryptocurrency is full of meme coins, each trying to be the next big thing like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu or Pepe. But most of these coins are about dogs, cats, or frogs. 

While the market is flooded with dog, cat, and frog-themed coins, i found a one new entrant stands out for its distinctiveness and i do think this can be a next big meme coin if it catches some attention: The Donkey King, also known as 'Doky'. 

#Donkey king (Doky) is a Solana meme coin. Here’s why I am bullish on Doky meme coins:

**Uniqueness: A Refreshing Idea**

The first thing that got me interested in this meme coin is it's different from other meme coins. Wif , Pepe and other meme coins that made it to the top had one thing in common and that is all of these came up with a different meme idea. A copy pasted idea doesn't really last long in my opinion.

Donkeys are different and fun, making Doky stand out. People are always curious about new things, and a donkey coin is a fresh idea that can grab the  attention.

**Minimal Developer Involvement**

One of the most appealing aspects of Doky meme coin is the minimal involvement of developers in holding the coin’s supply. With most of the Doky supply held by the community and only 5% retained by the developer for project development, there's a reduced risk of large-scale sell-offs that can crash the coin’s value. 

This approach fosters trust and transparency, as the community knows that the developers are committed to the project’s growth rather than short-term gains.

**Doky MarketCap**

As per CoinMarketCap data Doky is currently sitting at $1.8 Million marketcap. 

If we compare it with the coins that made it to the top $1.8M marketcap is nothing. Pepe and Wif alone sitting at $6B and $3 billion marketcap. So the potential is huge if things start taking off and it takes no time for a meme coin. Most of you know that.

Meme Coins have so much potential and can make you life changing money if you get into it early and have a right choice.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,SatOllie's Diaries: from the genesis of Bitcoin until the present day ($BTC on Solana),"**8/8/2024: The Genesis of Bitcoin**
SatOllie here! After reading that token creation on pump fun is now FREE, my mind went into overdrive. A peer-to-peer electronic cash system. A currency that could change everything. I felt this rush of excitement, the same feeling I imagine the original Satoshi had when he penned his Bitcoin whitepaper. I dropped the link in the ""Street Bets"" Discord. Time to see if the world was ready. Spoiler alert: they weren’t. Not yet.

**9/8/2024: The Slow Drip**
Woke up and checked the chart, expecting to see fireworks... instead, just a few buys trickling in. Street Bets was too busy getting rugged by some presale coin to notice my groundbreaking creation. Classic. Oh well, early days, and patience is key.

**10/8/2024: The Rise Begins**
Boom! We’re gaining traction! Word has spread about this revolutionary digital currency called Bitcoin, and throughout the morning the buys kept rolling in. By midday, we hit King of the Hill status! We even started a Telegram group, and I’m feeling this nostalgia vibe - it’s like the Bitcoin forums and newsgroups all over again. I paid for a Dexscreener listing in anticipation of bonding, and to show my commitment to the project.

**11/8/2024: Jeet and Repeat**
The King of the Hill high didn’t last long. Some folks jeeted hard, as expected. A lesson learned from the old Bitcoin days: not everyone has diamond hands. But the vibe in our Telegram channel? Electric. It feels like a time machine straight to 2009, with OGs reminiscing about the early Bitcoin days. The community is small, but it’s mighty.

**12/8/2024: Pump Fun Shenanigans**
Thanks to some generous investors, we now have marketing funds. Time to play with the big boys. We launched a bump bot on pump fun because, let’s face it, visibility is everything. Market cap’s creeping towards $60k. Slow but steady wins the race. It’s crazy watching history repeat itself, but now in this wild west of meme tokens and SOL bonds.

**13/8/2024: The Raydium Rollercoaster**
Someone dropped 30 SOL on $BTC today, finally completing the pump fun bonding curve and launching us on Raydium! It was glorious for about five minutes before they immediately sold off, tanking the price in a sharp drop. Oh, the joys of early crypto markets—wild swings and instant heartbreak. Onward and upward!

**14/8/2024: Jeet Storm**
$BTC is now live on Raydium! The market cap hit $54k for a hot second before the inevitable jeeting began. Totally normal, and honestly, I’m not even mad. It’s part of the process. The thrill of the game keeps me going.

**15-16/8/2024: The Raid Begins**
We’ve built a solid Telegram community—200 strong and growing! Raids are happening everywhere: Reddit, X, you name it. We’re making noise. The people need to know about this coin, and we’re here to make sure they do.

**17-19/8/2024: The Calm After the Storm**
The weekend was quiet—too quiet. Most of the early pump fun buyers have taken their profits and moved on, leaving us at a $13k market cap. But this? This is where the real fun begins. We’ve formed a strong floor, and the diehards remain.

**20/8/2024: The Diamond Hands Chronicles Begin**

The Telegram has become one big LARP, and honestly, we’re having a blast. Memes, jokes, and talks of the glory days are keeping us going, but make no mistake—we’re still in this for the gains. The dream? To push this market cap high enough that we can all afford some pizza with our $BTC. The laughs are great, but we’ve got our eyes on that moon. Time to rebuild and send it.

**SatOllie out.** 💎✋ Let’s keep making history.

Bitcoin ($BTC) is the first LARP-driven memecoin on the Solana network.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$HEGE | Why Liquidity and Community Strength is Critical,"Investors tend to be focused on market cap, however, less seasoned investors tend to overlook liquidity and community strength. Practically, people will sell their coins for various reasons and projects have to be prepared for that (people dream of what they're going to do when their crypto holdings moon which requires selling). With good reason, projects all fear when whales sell their tokens because if there is not enough liquidity or the community is not strong enough, the token price will collapse.

$HEGE experienced such an event 2 days ago. Our 3rd largest holder (held 2.2% of all tokens) sold half his bag over the course of half a day. Because $HEGE has great liquidity and a strong community that is ready to eat any dip, the price of $HEGE ended up at the same price after the exit versus before the exit started (at some later point, the whale ended up buying back in)!

The amount in a liquidity pool tells you how much SOL there is to be cashed out by sellers (amount / 2 because half is in the token itself). There is a relatively new dog coin on the ETH chain that claims to have relations with SHIB. Apparently they are threatened by $HEGE and have recently told their community members to target us because we are ""running them over'. So, using them as an example, they have a market cap around $58.0M and Liquidity of around $1.4M having a HORRIBLE MC to Liquidity ratio of 41:1 (versus $HEGE's great 7:1 ratio). Another way to look at it is even though the token is ""worth"" $58M, there is only $700k total of SOL for sellers to have (the other $700k is in the token). Thus, what happens is any medium sized sale will cause that dog coin's market cap to come crashing down.

The events over the past few days have proved $HEGE's resiliency to whales taking profit. Put your money in a place that is protected from the downside but has huge upside potential. Come join our community and see for yourself (links at the bottom).

Since inception, $HEGE has:

* Reached >5,000 holders, 3,800 Tg members, and 2,500 X followers
* Gotten listed on CMC, Yahoo Finance, and Apple iPhone Stocks Application
* Deployed Generative AI bots for each of the characters in the Hege storyline for users to interact with and for automated marketing
* Developed a controllable puppet rig of Hege that is used for creating animations and livestreaming
* Created a series of animations that has been released and will continue to come out over the following weeks and months

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,New memecoin Snake wif Hat launches soon!,"New memecoin on the block called Snake wif Hat. All big wif coins have performed very well but the difference to this one is that there is a already legit community existing putting cute hats on their snakes. And the best thing about it is that the coin hasnt launched yet. Final launch date hasnt been released yet but it might be soon. So make sure to check out the TG and watch this project closely. I see big green dildo candles coming as soon as this launches. NFA though ;)

There is not much info out in general but since $wif is on sol im guessing this will be on sol as well and thus prob launch on pump fun.

Here's why I'm personally bullish on the project: I know a few in the team personally and last project they were in went to 1.9 Million at its peak. Now imagine a starting mcap of 4k up to even 1M is insane returns.

Now ofc I recommend you join the telegram yourself and have a look. With more people joining, more infos will be released. And just for a disclaimer this is full Degen trading and super risky, make sure to stay save and DYOR.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$TSUKI - Biggest sleeping giant in crypto. 10 reasons I can't sleep at night!,"This project is **the** craziest rabbit hole in all of crypto. It is full of puzzles and riddles! Don't worry, we've already figured lots of it out.

Ready? (This is just a FRACTION of it buddy)

*CA: 463SK47VkB7uE7XenTHKiVcMtxRsfNE2X4Q9wByaURVA*

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

# 1. TSUKI ties to Roaring Kitty

Roaring Kitty (RK) is also known as DeepFuckingValue or Keith Gill. A massively influential person. DYOR!

TSUKI preceded Keith's return after 3 years away from Twitter. TSUKI posted an RK meme, and RK returned to twitter 1 day, 1 hour, 1 minute after that. TSUKI preceded RK a few more times within the span of about a month. The disclaimer page on the TSUKI website is also signed ""DFV/KG.""

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

# 2. WallStreetBets Arrives

WSB was in the TSUKI telegram at around 200k mcap. He hyped TSUKI up massively at a price range that makes zero sense unless WSB wanted to feed into the TSUKI narrative. When asked if RK is behind TSUKI, WSB responded, ""you're wondering if Keith is behind TSUKI, I'm wondering who's behind Keith"" indicating a team around RK.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

# 3. WallStreetBets Leaves Dramatically

Wallstreetbets left TSUKI telegram due to ""harassment"" from one community member named ""Dr. No."" Dr. No is the bad guy from a James Bond movie **who attempts to stop a space launch.** If you know Roaring Kitty, you know he loves his movie references.

This was 100% staged.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

# 4. The NFT Tweets - Obviously Coordinated

On the 17th of August, Phantom wallet posted on Twitter ""OK hear me out... NFT's."" Solana replied ""bring back NFTs tbh."" WallStreetBets tweeted ""wait, NFTs are back?""

**TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE THESE TWEETS BEGAN,** the TSUKI community solved one of the riddles given by dev. The answer to this riddle was ""Time to unlock the TSUKI NFT page!"" Additionally, TSUKI dev posted in-between the Phantom and WSB posts! (TSUKI has posted only a handful of times).

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

# 5. Solana Phone Partnership? Qualcomm / 665

The TSUKI dev is named ""Dvid665"" on Telegram. Dvid665 = Device ID 665 (Snapdragon 665 chip used in the Solana Phone. Ryan Cohen (Gamestop CEO) recently posted Trump's name 665 times on Twitter. This all hints towards the Solana Phone and TSUKI being involved somehow with the Gamestop merger.

Some people behind Qualcomm are OG engineers from Solana as well.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

# 6. Gamestop Merger?

GME is likely merging with Chewy, Toys R Us and several more. Roaring Kitty is definitely involved with this. This merger involves discussion of an NFT marketplace. TSUKI is creating an anime and brand around its name, and will offer NFTs.

In relation to the release ""Tsukihima,"" a video game based on an anime, Gamestop posted ""what is your favorite anime?"" A community member responded ""TSUKI of course!"" This got a like from the Gamestop Twitter!

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

# 7. Let them Leave, it's Good.

Following the initial post-launch pump in May, TSUKI crashed relatively hard. Dev subtly indicated in the chat that this was intentional. Much of the community at the time was just there to get rich, impatient moonboys, constantly harassing dev asking if he's Elon, etc. Dev wanted to weed out the impatient and non-believers.

If you know RK, you know he's THE cult leader for memestock / ape culture (diamond hands, etc.). He wants strong believers and supporters to make up the core of the TSUKI community. I can say 4 months into TSUKI's lifespan, our community is genuinely amazing now!

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

# 8. Mysterious Floor Support

Roaring Kitty is known for buying Gamestop shares in $5,000 increments repeatedly. For a couple months now, when TSUKI hits its floor price, several buys of 5 SOL come in from new wallets. Happens all the time 🤷‍♂️

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

# 9. The Chart

Silly to waste a point on this, but seriously take a look at our chart over at dexscreener. It's a sexy ass chart ready for takeoff. If you can read charts at all you'll see.

# 10. Milestone - Roaring Kitty Video ?

* MC@15M: Collaborate with one of YouTube's top 🐱 ⌛️***1f920babbb0f2cc50bb7495264338726843338b8483f67f82e6a078758aae592***

This roadmap milestone included a code \^ This code was eventually cracked by the TSUKI community. It contained a link to youtube. This link led to Roaring Kitty's stream. Presumably, once TSUKI hits 15m, it will explode due to this video...

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

I think RK might have something to do with this project...

Here's the breakdown:

1. 60% allocated to a presale to foster a broad and inclusive distribution.
2. 18% designated for burned liquidity, enhancing overall security.
3. 5% set aside for Centralized Exchange (CEX) listings, with a 30-day lock for heightened security

Fairlaunch Details:

Our fairlaunch is scheduled to take place from June 13th to June 16th, with a soft cap of 50 SOL and liquidity set at 30%. We've strategically planned our fairlaunch to leverage the high volatility of the low liquidity market, supported by an aggressive marketing campaign and ample funds for both pre-launch and post-launch activities.


We strategically keep the liquidity of the presale raising funds at 30% and burn it to leverage the high volatility that comes with a low liquidity market at launch. To maximize this potential, we have planned an aggressive marketing campaign and have ample funds ready from our side, as well as the 65% marketing funds we receive from the presale after the sale is finalized for both pre-token launch and post-token launch marketing. This approach aims to attract a significant number of investors and traders at launch. With this influx of investors and traders, we believe we can drive the market upwards. Additionally, we plan to buy back tokens and burn them at launch ourselves, further stimulating the market and supporting our token's value and We have planned to use 15% of the marketing funds to buy back tokens at launch and burn them to support the token value.


Conclusion:

In conclusion, BullRun2024 is more than just a meme project; it's a movement that's poised to redefine possibilities and shape the future of the crypto space. We invite you to join us on this exhilarating journey as we pave the way for a new era of

laughter, creativity, and cultural expression in the thrilling Bull Run of 2024.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,Why I am Buying $GigaChad on Ethereum: A Thread,"1/10
 $GigaChad is one of the most recognizable universal memes and an OG 2023 Eth meme alongside Pepe, Mog, and Bobo. Unlike its peers, $GigaChad lacked a team to push it—until now. 

2/10
 Dive into the holder base of $GigaChad and you'll find whales with significant holdings in Pepe, Mog, and Bobo. These are people with conviction. Study previous millionaires and you'll see why they believe $GigaChad is a minimum 1 billion market cap meme. 

3/10
 Liquidity will ultimately flow to Ethereum. Eth Maxis know the hype surrounding other chains will eventually fade, and that money will come back to Eth. We saw this in 2020-21 with $BNB. $GigaChad is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this shift. 

4/10
 Even if you're not an Eth Maxi, recognize that $GigaChad's universal appeal will attract significant capital from Eth enthusiasts. That's a fact. 

5/10
 Some coins on other chains suffer from low liquidity, which deters large whales. In contrast, our liquidity on Ethereum is extremely strong, making $GigaChad a more attractive investment. 

6/10
 Ethereum is a stronger chain. Solana makes it easy to jeet and for weak hands to sell off, but Ethereum discourages this behavior. $GigaChad, as an OG meme, is set to soar with the right push. 

7/10
 In crypto, things move fast. Today's hot item can quickly become yesterday's news. Just look at Andy. In March, Andy on SOL was at a 50m market cap while Andy on ETH was at 2m. Fast forward, and Andy on ETH is sitting at 155m (with a 200+m ATH) while Andy on SOL dropped to 3m. 

8/10
 The universal appeal of $GigaChad cannot be overstated. Its strong meme status combined with the robust Eth ecosystem makes it a prime candidate for explosive growth. 

9/10
 Study the trends, watch the whales, and see why $GigaChad is generating so much buzz. It's not just a meme—it's a movement. 

10/10
 Don't miss out on what could be the next big thing in crypto. With the right support and the power of Ethereum, $GigaChad is poised to reach a 1 billion market cap and beyond.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,"Why BUENO? if you know the right people, you can make a ton of $$$. if not, you're gonna lose. follow a dev that makes gains--- here is how i made $ last bullrun and this one.","BUENO is a new sol token. Dev is Miyazaki, who this year took Kendu to 250mill and Mega to 30mill. Bueno is currently at 5mill, so I think you can do 10x here, probably even more. he named it after his cat, which is the meta right now.

99% of meme tokens are scams. you're gonna get beaten by a clever farm team. sorry.

however, if you know certain devs who make $ for themselves and their community, you simply follow what that dev is doing. (im not talking about 'influencers' that post 10 projects a day for pump and dump)

im talking about actual devs.

last bullrun, when most of the meme projects were BNB, i made a fuckton of $ because i got friendly with some devs, and just bought into their projects.

im doing the same this bullrun, but its mostly SOL and ETH.

not all of the devs i follow im friendly with--- some i just know to follow.

anyways, this new token BUENO is launched by a dev who has a good track record this year-- everything he is a dev on did a 10x minimum for me personally. (i suppose people who got in earlier did 20x or 100x, im just being honest about when i got in and what sorta profit i made)

DYOR, but i cant stress enough, it aint about the project, or the marketing, or anything, except for the dev.... find a few devs with a proven track record, you'll make $ this bullrun. I certainly have. 

BHX4SUvAcchzxd3hPr1KH4w83tzu9QdbYwjyXdK7pump is the contract address for BUENO.

P.S. - if you find a good dev who makes his people $, likely you will meet other people in that community that also have alpha tips. made a lot of $ that way last bullrun and this one, got chummy with other whales and we made $ together. be smart, stop gambling. your net worth = your network",59,2024-11-16 20:16:18,103

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,The hidden gem of the Crypto world - $ZYPTO,"Zypto has been going from strength to strength with no signs of slowing down. This token is severely undervalued at the moment but not for long. Get in while you can still get a bargain!

The Zypto token is the native token of the Zypto network on the Eth chain. The Zypto network combines ZyptoPay, and the ZyptoApp to provide true financial functionality to the whole Crypto space.

One of the things I love about the Zypto network, is it allows you to directly purchase virtual crypto cards using memecoins, which provides a great off-ramp and creating true functionality from tokens with no true utility.

Some extremely bullish news from the team -

""Update regarding Zypto:

* More t1 CEX have approved/wants to have ZYPTO featured on their platform. The deployment will be done in the best way possible (From the bottom up)
* Zypto Defi app will be released in about 4 weeks!
* The Dubai deal will be announced in about 4 to 6 weeks once everything is signed and integrated! Hint: Got excited in 2021 ? It's back and done with no down side. ""

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,r/snoofi: Reddit dog with a thriving community - Next Low Cap Gem!,"**stumbled my way from the blockchain to reddit**

$SNOOFI is our favourite white & red dog which boasts a community of over 5000 members already putting it in the top 10% of communities on Reddit. The Snoofi community is tight knit, welcoming and is developing a lasting cult which fits all of Murads criteria for memecoin gems which will stand the test of time. The Snoofi devs have worked close with Reddit to ensure compliance which which grows from strength to strength compared to derivative tokens which have been removed across both Reddit & X. 

The Snoofi lore is strong with a central theme of **saving the trenches** from scammy memecoin rug pulls. The Snoofi community has survived for several months through multiple dips and continues to build from strength to strengh and grow its holder count to now beyond 8000 (and rising!). 

There is no telegram chat as the community is already vibrant as one of the earliest communities to make the most of Reddit's intrinsic chat feature! Jam packed collabs with multiple top memecoins including GMEcoin on SOL.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,"Baby neiro - THE Rise of A New King - 100% safu, long term legit project!","**THE RISE OF BABY NEIRO: A NEW LEGEND IS BORN**

After the passing of Doge, the most beloved meme in internet history, a new king was destined to rise. Baby Neiro, adopted by Atsuko Sato, carries the spirit of Doge and is set to dominate the meme kingdom, uniting both old and new memes.

**Doge’s Legacy**

Doge wasn’t just a meme; he was a cultural phenomenon, spreading joy and laughter worldwide. But like all legends, Doge had to pass the torch to the next generation. The meme world was ready for a new hero.

**The Arrival of Baby Neiro**

Enter Baby Neiro: small, wide-eyed, and mischievous, capturing hearts across the internet. Though young, Baby Neiro exudes the same playful spirit and charm as Doge. With his innocent grin and boundless energy, Baby Neiro embodies the perfect blend of nostalgia and future potential.

**The Coronation**

The coronation of Baby Neiro took place atop the sacred Meme Mountain, where the greatest memes are honored. Atsuko Sato raised Baby Neiro high into the sky, and the meme world erupted in cheers. Baby Neiro was crowned the new meme king, ready to carry the legacy forward.

**Rivals and Allies**

The meme kingdom is full of rivals and allies. Figures like SHIB, Pepe, Baby Doge, and Brett still stand tall, each representing different eras of meme history. Some will challenge Baby Neiro’s rule, while others will join forces with him to shape the future of the meme world.

**A New Legacy**

With Baby Neiro on the throne, the future of memes looks bright. He is not only the heir to Doge’s legacy but the herald of a new era, where creativity and laughter will continue to thrive. Baby Neiro is the meme king for the future, blending the best of both worlds.

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,$EMOTI community is growing day by day - Don't be to late for the coming breakout - Team KYC'd - Loaded with launched Utility,"$EMOTI - Fusion of Meme and Utility?! The $EMOTI community is growing organically day by day ON SOL!I've seen my fair share of cryptocurrency projects come and go, but a new player caught my attention recently: Emoti-Coin.

# 👥A Community-Driven Movement

What sets $EMOTI apart is its vibrant and active community. In its current Stage, the project emphasizes conquering the market by empowering its members. The community engages in creating content, promoting the project, and driving social media campaigns. It’s clear that EMOTI is as much about the people behind it as the technology itself.

# Why $EMOTI Matters ❓

For anyone looking to dive into a project with real potential and a supportive community, Emoti-Coin might be worth exploring. It’s not often that a project comes along with such a solid foundation and genuine community engagement.

# Final Thoughts

I’ve been keeping an eye on Emoti-Coin, and it seems like it’s on a promising path. If you're curious about what’s next for this intriguing project, **you can find more information on their Website (in comments too).** It might just be the wave you want to ride in the crypto world.",495,2024-11-05 19:19:38,28
SOL,CryptoMoonShots,The Magic Internet Money wizards are casting some serious spell on $MIM,"I wanted to share a really cool CTO project with you guys. ATH is 9M MC, currently sitting at around 500K MC. Community is still active. They have a temporary raid rewards bot, but they are cooking up one of their own that’s made to compete with some of the others. The memes are great, the main Twitter account is active and they are fairly active here at r/MIMonSOL



One thing I thought was kind of neat that they posted today is that they’re going to begin airdropping random holders every month. They are preparing to airdrop some of the most active communities on SOL as well so I’m expecting a lot more eyes on this project soon.



It’s worth noting that their treasury has something like 7% of supply and a pretty large liquidity pool so they do have some some sort of income which is definitely a net plus for a CTO. This is definitely a net plus compared to the CTO’s begging for change and at the mercy of user donations. All of their funds are locked away in a multisig wallet too so I’m not really worried about a big dump.



The chart keeps on rejecting going lower than 500K so the community seems to be adamant about defending its chart. My gut feeling is that it’s up only from here. I’m curious to see how they use their LP SOL rewards in the future. I’m expecting a snowball effect of self-propulsion alongside volume. 



Ultimately, I just really like the meme. Magic internet money is classic and we need more of the old fashioned BTC style HODL and less of the new flashy dog/cat coins in my opinion atleast. If the community is still kicking this hard after 5 months while most coins have died, I think they’re way below value. Anyways, as always DYOR and good luck!

SOL,CryptoMoonShots,"After Selling $200,000 USD in NFTs, $HEGE is Launching an Enormous Marketing Campaign","Over the weekend, HegeCoin's official NFT set went to main sale and sold out within 90 minutes due to crazy demand. All NFTs available were sold and now the collection of 2,222 NFTs will start generating monthly dividends for its holders. Your only way to acquire one now is on the secondary markets like Magic Eden / Tensor.

There are now several things that will push HEGE to new highs:

1. $120,000 USD Buyback of HEGE. There is roughly $30,000 USD in the NFT Bank and $20,000 in the Future Utility Bank, both which will be used to buy back HEGE. There is an additional $70,000 in the Treasury wallet which will also be used to buy back HEGE for a total buyback amount of $120,000 USD.
2. Content Creation on Steroids - With the increased budget, we will be ramping up our content creation over the next 3 months. Expect to see more content than ever before.
3. 18 Channel Marketing Campaign - With these funds, HEGE will be launching an insane marketing campaign to reach more potential investors than ever before. This campaign will last for approximately 2 weeks and will be the largest marketing campaign in the 6 month history of Hege. The campaign will include the following 18 channels with most events lasting between 7-14 days:

   * TikTok / YouTube / Ig posting contests using TrafficTide's viral platform
   * Renting the CryptoCurrency Subreddit Banner
   * AMA on the CryptoCurrency Subreddit (pinned to top of CC Subreddit for 4 days)
   * 6 YouTube KOLs
   * 9 X KOLs to call our project
   * Press Release to over 75 outlets, including Decrypt, CoinMarketCap, and CryptoCompare. Featured on the homepage of each one. Also featured on Business Insider, [Investing.Com](http://Investing.Com), Benzinga, AP, ADVFN, and Google News
   * YouTube Ads
   * Large Scale Airdrops to over 3000 high value holders of other projects
   * Daily 50 Subreddit + CMS Reddit blasts
   * Reddit Contests
   * X Raiding Contests 
   * Meme Contests
   * Instagram Giveaways
   * X KOL RTs for expand contest and giveaway reach
   * SolScan Ads
   * DexScreener Ads
   * NFT Promotion with Pure
   * X Spaces call on ""How They Built It"" with GameStop. AMA / X Spaces call with Shiba Wings (sax player for Pink Floyd)

Finally, there are 3 more significant events to point out:

1. We have been working on increasing our X Spaces presence and making inroads with some KOLs. We have signed up a small KOL to be an ambassador, are exploring many different partnerships (will be released when finalized), and are working on an partnership to having a regular spaces presence.
2. Remember how we struck a deal to allow normies to buy $HEGE with credit cards / bank debit directly from a phone app? This will be going live in the next few weeks and will be available to United States, Australian, and New Zealand citizens.
3. With our Hegends NFT launch, we have been generating royalties on transactions. Even though our main sale was only 3 days ago, we have already generated approximately $3,500 in royalties, with $1,750 going into the marketing bank and another $1,750 going into the NFT bank being paid out as dividends to NFT holders. This will provide great funding for our project going forward.

With fresh funds secured in the treasury and a continuing revenue stream into the future, HEGE is armed with tools that we could only previously dream of. HEGE's future is now more secure and looking brighter than ever before. The buzz in the community is also noticable. People are coming forward and becoming involved in the project faster than ever before!

As always, DYOR, but HEGE is looking like it can skyrocket at any minute.

SOL,Altcoin,Solana's Rise Fuels DeFi Growth and Staking Opportunities,"Solana (SOL) has experienced a notable boost in performance in the past few months, mainly thanks to its distinctive blockchain technology providing high speed, affordable transactions, and scalability. The improved performance boosts user satisfaction and backs the expanding network of decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects, establishing Solana as a top competitor in the cryptocurrency industry.  
  
Bitget and Binance are now offering restaking services for SOL in order to capitalize on Solana's growing popularity, enabling users to earn BNSol and BGSol recpectively which can be used for restaking. The APR (Binance 10.45% and Bitget 22%) on these exchanges further encourages users to stake their sol on this platform.  
  
Bitget recently launch its BGSOL staking which has exceeded $10 million in under 24 hours, demonstrating significant user engagement. Users can restake BGSol on Bitget flexible saving to earn more APR. This shows exchanges increase interest in deFi and could position Sol as the top token soon.

SOL,Altcoin,Solana Memecoins history and current state; The ones that had the strength to overcome the hardships and prevail.,"&#x200B;

If you've been in this space long enough, you probably remember all the projects that claimed to be the next big thing. I'm talking about $Chef, $BLBY, $YeWifHat, $Seat, $Powsche, $RedPill, and so on. The only two projects I'm not throwing any shade at are $Powsche and $Seat, as their communities really tried to fight and keep up with their hard work (and who knows, one day they may be back). Other projects (99% of them) fall into the worst category of them all: Rug Pulls.

&#x200B;

A lot of meme coin projects didn't have the quality and the strength to fight off certain trends in the market. We had a few major dips in the market, then the Andrew Tate frenzy, the WIFHAT phase, the Donald Trump shooting, and so on; Phases where a lot of people were abandoning their projects and were brainlessly chasing pumps (which led them to losing their money every single time).

&#x200B;

**In the sea of projects two of them prevailed, and stood tall and strong after every trend fight-off - I'm talking about $HEGE and $KENDU.** The reason for that is simple - their communities didn’t allow them to fall. We all know that community is the most important factor of a meme coin project. **Both of these communities were too strong and united; they held with conviction and fought off the jeets every single time.**

&#x200B;

Disclosure-wise, my one and only conviction play is $HEGE. That doesn’t mean I’m here to bash on Kendu, even though bashing is something that some of their certain individuals always do to us and our community. I acknowledge and respect their ""Working for our bags"" mentality, and they do a fantastic job of actively raiding, shilling, and spreading the word about their project. The only reason I'm not a holder is because, with all due respect to them, I see more potential in Hege.

&#x200B;

As of this writing, Hege has a market cap of $6.5 million and as for Kendu, it is $100 million. That means that in order to double my money, if I go with Hege, I need a $13 million market cap. With Kendu, I would need $200 million. Another example would be putting $100 into both projects and waiting for a $200 million market cap. An investment in Kendu would then be worth $200, while an investment in Hege would be worth $3,000. The logic is very clear: Hege has MUCH more room to grow. Everything I said was with all due respect to Kendu community, and I wish nothing but the best for them. We all can eat. As for us and our community:

# 

# $HEGE is considered to be the king of Reddit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Recently, more focus has been put on real-life marketing stunts, as well as growing our presence on other social media platforms (X, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok). The most recent marketing stunt was an airplane flying above Los Angeles with our banner. The stunt yielded great results, as many people joined our Telegram group directly from it.

&#x200B;

[Plane with $HEGE banner flying above the Hollywood.](https://preview.redd.it/yffv3dmyi2id1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f99536d10d22a1b9ff4575060307dab9315e086)

&#x200B;

**Our team member fully customized a $HEGE-RV and is doing a tour with it.** Over the next few months, our $HEGE-RV will be making its way around the US and Canada. The RV will visit many famous landmarks and sites of interest (i.e., Las Vegas Strip, Santa Monica Pier, Yosemite National Park, etc.).

&#x200B;

[$HEGE-RV visiting the South of the Border.](https://reddit.com/link/1epq7gw/video/3ibig7azi2id1/player)

&#x200B;

Hege's real-life-sized mascot is in the works, and we will soon have some insane content featuring it (for example: Hege's mascot interviewing people on the street). Besides that, there are many more real-life marketing stunts that are being worked on behind the scenes, but I can't talk about it currently. We want it to be a surprise!

&#x200B;

On the technical side of things, we like to say that our boy $HEGE is Rug-Proof. LP tokens are burned; freeze and mint authority are revoked. You can find all of the safety information in the following picture:

&#x200B;

Being a part of the $HEGE community brings you many opportunities to earn while working for your bags. We constantly host competitions and contests where our members' hard work and creativity pay off big time! We often host Reddit competitions, meme contests, social media giveaways, and so on. We even had a ""$1,000 Riddle"" giveaway where the member with the best detective skills won big! Currently, we're hosting a sticker contest (until August 19th) that has a $2,000 prize pool! Get creative and you're in it for a chunky win!

If you're wondering what's next, the team has released a 13-page document outlining future plans for our boy $HEGE. That means you can get an inside scoop on the project, so check it out.

&#x200B;

I'll conclude this post with the following statement: This project has everything it takes to reach a billion-dollar market cap. Once it gains even a little bit of exposure, an insane takeoff is imminent. Watching it from the sidelines will not be a pleasant experience, knowing you could have hopped on the rocket.

SOL,Altcoin,Can Tron meme surpass Solana meme?," Solana meme has dominated the meme industry for a longtime surpassing Eth and BNB. While Ton ecosystem has been buzzling with a lot of projects outperforming $Solana will be hard, although Ton is currently the hub for #Crypto adoption with so many innovative projects like #Notcoin, #HamsterKombat, #Pixfil, #Tomarkeai etc. With the entrance of Tron to meme coin industry could it outperform Solana meme? Despite Justin Sun frequent post about SunPump and tagging himself as SunPump Chief Customer Service will this help him to led a new meme coin era?

SOL,Altcoin,8-Bit Coin changing the whole Solana GameFi space,"“We have created $COIN in 2024 with one simple goal, to render it as the most valuable gaming-focused asset”. -Team

8-Bit Coin will probably never stop surprising me. When you look at the chart and market cap you would think that the team spend enormous amounts of money on marketing, calls, partnerships etc. But the opposite is the truth. To date, there has been almost 0 marketing. Only some Reddit posts and 1 single small partnership.

So no, I am not joking when I say 8-Bit Coin will be the biggest GameFi project on Solana.

And the reason? Well, it is very simple. The people on the team are BONK whales. And when I say whales I mean one of the biggest holders of BONK. And they made this coin with 1 goal. To level up game development on Solana network.

Just imagine what will happen once the real bull-run starts and they start with paid marketing. BONK partnership, big institutions, articles everywhere.

8-Bit Coin is a great investment right now because as one of the community members said “Literally the easiest buy and hold, number goes up like the s&p.” So you can make nice 2x at this stage with no marketing and shitty market. BUT!!!!! Once they start, holy macaroni this will be insane.

8-Bit Coin is one of those projects that everyone should have in their portfolio if they want some nice safe returns.

According to the Binance Crypto Fear & Greed Index, the market is at greed, a little more than neutral at 65. As last week, we are seeing 72, which is significant as compared to this week. Solana is trading at a discount from its peak in April. From the peak of 200$ to the lowest near 124$, and is currently trading around 140$. What are the expectations for Solana's future price?  

Solana URL:[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana)

From Coingecko, Solana chain has a market dominance of 4.2%; however, base chain and arbitrum are chasing tight behind. Personally, I heard about Base Chain’s memecoins rising, and I think they have huge potential. With only 1.79% dominance, there is a huge space for growth. Base has been performing significantly for the past 30 days, whereas Solana has underperformed as compared.

Solana has several robust memecoins with a huge market cap, which undoubtedly boosts its value. Such as WIF,BONK,BOME,POPCAT, MEW, and Honerable mention (POWSCHE$). Maneki and Gummy sparked the market this week.

Base has Brett with dominating performances as compared to its peers in the chain. There are still spaces with huge potential for new 100 million market cap coins in the near future in the chain.

SOL,Altcoin,Will TON network meme outperform Solana meme?,"Ton Blockchain continues to lead in crypto adoption by introducing innovative projects like Notcoin, Tapswap, Hamster, Dogs, etc. All these tap-to-earn projects continue to buzz the ecosystem while hypes and user expectations continue to rise. This creative innovation has led to a massive accumulation of $TON which has seen the token rise from $2.5 to $7.4.

Similar to the rise of Solanameme, Ton is trekking in the same direction but I wonder if it could outperform Solana. With the introduction of the first Ton Dog meme (DOGS Point), many wonder if it could outperform $BONK over 27k % gain. Considering the fact that $DOGS was airdropped to telegram users based on age of their account, many analysts are skeptical it could attain that height but don’t forget the success of $NOT which promises nothing but did a huge airdrop to users.

I wonder if Bitget and Gateio adding DOGS to their Pre-market Trading means anything but since DOGS image is inspired by Spotty, a mascot created by TON founder Pavel Durov for the Telegram community we could be on for something big.

SOL,Altcoin,Deep Dive on Solana ($SOL)- NOT a Shitcoin and The Most Undervalued Top 15 Altcoin (IMO),"Hello! Wanted to share my thoughts on Solana, a blockchain platform that I believe has the most upside potential of the top \~15 cryptocurrencies currently on the market.

Coinmarket Cap Link - [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/)

**The Founding Story (**[Source](https://docs.solana.com/history)**)**

* **Solana's Founder Anatoly Yakovenko spent the bulk of his professional career at Qualcomm, Dropbox, and Mesosphere** where he spent a lot of time designing distributed systems and figuring out how to get different systems of software and hardware to talk to each other
* It was at Qualcomm that Anatoly met two of his other **Solana co-founders, Greg Fitzgerald and Stephen Akridge** and the three of them spent nearly a decade working together
* **Greg had an expertise in languages** and compilers and he convinced Anatoly to migrate Solana’s codebase from the C programming language to Rust and became the CTO of Solana
* **Stephen led the GPU backend that constantly beat Nvidia** and he demonstrated that massive amounts of time could be saved through GPUs leading Anatoly to recruit him to the team in early 2018
* The **Solana founding team had about a decade of experience working together** solving complex software and hardware problems at Qualcomm and **you don’t find many founding teams with such deep qualified shared work histories like this in the crypto space**
* Solana was the name of a beach in San Diego where the three of them would often surf so the name doesn’t really have particular significance beyond that

**Proof of Work vs. Stake vs. History**

* **What sets Solana apart from its competitors is its core innovation, Proof of History**
* To understand Proof of History and why it’s different, we first need to go over the method Bitcoin made famous which is proof of work and this is what Ethereum currently uses as well (explaining this for the beginners on the sub)
   * For **proof of work**, when person A sends a transaction to person B through a blockchain, there are 1000s of computers also known as miners that work to confirm the transaction by solving tiny math problems and once a number of computers agree that a transaction is correct, then the transaction goes through, a block is produced, and the computers are rewarded with tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum
      * **This basically is the essence of the buzzword decentralization** you hear so often because instead of one centralized system like the US Treasury that mints money, a crowd of people are earning money in the form of tokens through computers
      * There are large mining farms across the world that have thousands of computers making computations to earn tokens through Proof of Work and this has caused many to worry about all the electricity consumption cryptocurrency mining is resulting in
      * **But the bigger problem with proof of work is that it’s much too slow** with Bitcoin and Ethereum both struggling to scale beyond 15 transactions per second and **in addition to that, average fees per transaction currently (as of 5/19/21) sit at** [$13 for bitcoin](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m) **and** [$21 for Ethereum](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#3m) which is just way too high
   * In interviews, Anatoly states that he views Bitcoin and Ethereum more as revolutionary proof of concept products rather than platforms structured to serve worldwide audiences (debatable point of view ofc)
      * **Bitcoin** proved that cryptography could be used to create currencies while **Ethereum** proved that blockchain technology could be used for smart contracts BUT **neither were built with the knowledge of how massive crypto would get and how transaction fees would skyrocket**
* The next development to improve upon Proof of Work is called **Proof of Stake**, which is something Ethereum is trying to migrate to but there have been many delays
   * **In proof of work,** the miners who are willing to spend more on energy consumption are selected to confirm the transactions on the blockchain
   * **In proof of stake,** miners are called validators and validators are chosen based on the amount of money they lock away or how much they have ""staked"" and the more validators have staked, the more likely they will be chosen to confirm transactions and thus earn tokens
      * If a bad actor tries to attack the network or do something sketchy, the tokens he/she has ""staked"" will be taken away (this is known as slashing) and provides a layer of protection against bad actors
      * **PoS completely gets rid of the need to consume massive amounts of energy** and is a much more sophisticated approach that many cryptocurrencies have migrated to
* This is where Solana's **Proof of History** comes in
   * Solana still uses proof of stake as its method of verifying blocks, but Anatoly pushed it forward by creating a consensus mechanism called Proof of History and this is at the core is what makes Solana unique
   * **The trouble with decentralized systems is that you have thousands of computers working together to verify transactions but they each use their own clocks and don’t have a common notion of time**
      * As a result, most blockchain infrastructures require validators to talk to each other to agree on the time before verifying transactions and producing the next block
      * **This results in notable delays in the network and is the reason Bitcoin produces blocks only every 10 minutes and Ethereum every 15 seconds**
      * Here's an analogy: imagine that there is an army of 1000 soldiers who in this analogy represent each validator. Each soldier has his own watch and so the time to each soldier is what he believes the time to be, but the actual time may be off by a few seconds or minutes
      * This means that if a general wants the solders to execute an order at a very specific time, he needs to get all the soldiers to agree on the time before that order is fulfilled correctly which is basically what is happening in current blockchain infrastructures
   * **With Proof of History, all computers on the network agree on a universal time through what’s called a SHA-256, sequential-hashing verifiable delay function**
      * **Proof of history results in 0 delays in the network and no waiting around for other validators to agree on the time**
      * **As a result, while most of the latest proof of stake blockchains have blocktimes of a few seconds, Solana is able to achieve blocktimes of 0.4 seconds, and this is why Proof of History is a giant leap forward**

**Why Solana is a Gamechanger (**[reference this chart for this section](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium)**)**

* The primary reason is **Solana’s ability to scale**
   * Solana can currently achieve **blocktimes of 0.4 seconds** and **65,000 transactions per second** which makes **Solana one of the fastest blockchain infrastructures in the world**
   * What’s more is that as internet bandwidth and CPU and GPU improve, **block times can reduce and transactions per second can increase theoretically scale to infinity** with a 1gb network supporting about 700,000 TPS and a 10 gb network being able to support 7 million TPS
      * To be fair, this is true for most other crypto platforms as well
   * In comparison, **Visa requires 65,000 transactions per second**, and the **NASDAQ exchange requires 500,000, so Solana can support databases at any scale**
      * This is an extremely important development because applications as large as Facebook or exchanges like the NASDAQ can eventually be built on the Solana platform without performance issues and without enormous fees
* Solana’s capabilities are also better understood when compared against the competition
   * **Solana currently supports the highest transactions per second for a crypto with a working product** (this is from my knowledge, please correct me if I'm mistaken)
      * Though Ethereum 2.0 can scale to 100K transactions per second, the upgrade has yet to come
      * Cardano's hydra solution can scale to 1MM per second, but has no mainnet (launching in August 2021)
   * But more importantly, **Solana is miles ahead in block time versus the rest of the field due to proof of history and block times will also come down with time as well** with Anatoly on the record saying he envisions messages across Solana traveling at the speed of light
   * In addition, **Solana also offers extremely low transaction costs at $0.00001 meaning that 1 million transactions would only cost $10 and Solana also has more validators than the rest** of the field besides Avalanche ([chart reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium))
   * Github stars is a bit of a vanity metric and are similar to Facebook likes but basically even though Solana has only been around for a few years, it has a **pretty high number of Github stars which slightly demonstrates the interest developers have in the project** ([chart reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium))
   * And lastly **Solana is a complete layer 1 solution** meaning that everything is built on the Solana blockchain vs. Ethereum 2.0 and Polkadot which are two of Solana’s biggest competitors which utilize sharding ([chart reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium))
      * Sharding isn't a dealbreaker based on my research and I'm an ETH holder just to be clear but I do think having everything on a Layer 1 solution is cleaner
* All of this is why **Sam Bankman Fried, a prominent figure in the crypto community and founder of the exchange FTX, chose to operate Serum on Solana after a year of testing out different options**
   * In case you’re unfamiliar with it, FTX has been growing rapidly over the past 12 months and as a fun fact, the exchange recently paid for the rights to call the Miami Heat Arena FTX Arena

**Why I Believe Solana Can 3X-5X**

* The logic behind this is very simple and relates to **relative valuation** and this also is based on the assumption that the crypto market continues its bull run
   * Personally, I think we're in the mid to late stages of a crypto bubble, so what I've written below will not come true if the market collapses
* **As of 5/18/21, Solana's Market Cap = $14.6BN, Polkadot = $36.4BN, Cardano = $64.5BN**
   * I think Solana's tech makes it a pretty **undervalued cryptocurrency** just compared to other projects currently on the market
      * I'm not trying to ding other cryptos or say that other projects are bad, just saying I think Solana should be worth more than it is today based on these market caps
   * Why is this? I'm not sure, and perhaps it's because it's a relatively new project (founded in 2018) vs. the other ones so not as many investors are aware
      * **It's also possible I may have missed something, so please let me know if there is reason to doubt Solana or if other projects are just far superior**
   * Anyhow, all this is why if I had to choose one coin the top 15 right now, I would bet on Solana, and I am personally invested in it right now (for full disclosure)

**TLDR**:  Solana is one of the most performant blockchains in the crypto space, using an innovative technology called Proof of History to solve the scalability problem currently faced by earlier technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0. Solana has the potential to 3X-5X, considering that it has superior technology compared to many competitors that have much higher market caps and much fewer actual projects in their ecosystems.",37,2021-05-18 16:46:40,17
SOL,Altcoin,How will the FTX thunderstorm affect Solana and even the entire DeFi Lego?,"One of the most challenging and potential issues facing FTX Thunder is that the wrapper Sollet token of the solana ecosystem, i.e. soBTC, is widely used in lending and AMM platforms. The problem is that these tokens are issued by FTX (or Alameda, no one really knows). 

This is very problematic as almost all major DeFi platforms have soBTC assets as collateral as it has long been considered the de facto BTC in the Solana space. If soBTC proves to be worthless, it may exacerbate risk contagion on more dimensions.

I'm bullish with all the stuff happening with NFTs (that you can actually afford the gas) and the sol DeFi is growing like crazy. The coins in this ecosystem seem to have underperformed over the last year but with Coinbase beginning now integreating spl tokens maybe the smallcaps have some upside?

I just saw this [post on Medium](https://medium.com/marinade-finance/a-glimpse-towards-the-end-of-2022-8fa680aeafc9) about Marinade planning more utility for their mnde token. . If it's true they are working to decentralize solana then maybe whales will feel like they should be part of this. The marketcap is $10 million on coingecko.

SOL,Altcoin,The last chance to buy $HEGE before the biggest godcandle! ,"$HEGE has been out there long enough to prove us that it is a serious project that is not going anywhere. Rising during green market and holding during big market drops. And this is exactly what separates good coins like $HEGE from shitcoins that will sooner or later end up being rugged.

But this is not what I want to talk about today.

I want to talk about the generosity of $HEGE community and about the competitions they are holding every once in a while. And I am not talking about small prizes there. Every competition has 1k+ in prize-pool usually divided between 3-6 people.

And I think that $250 for making a simple Reddit posts or Tiktok videos is definitely worth it.

So first, let me tell you about my experience with $HEGE.

I first found $HEGE when it was at 700k market cap. I bought it here and sold for 2x without even joining the TG. But then I saw it absolutely flew and had to join. In only 1 month I won around 150k $HEGE tokens from competitions. That is around $4,5k at ATH and I never sold a single token.

And now you have a chance to win a giveaway too. The community is sending thousands of dollars to people making Reddit posts. The more you work, the more money you get. Simple as that.

And because the community is working hard every day, $HEGE is already listed on 4 exchanges and even appeared on Binance AMA, it is a no brainer here at 8mil market cap. I said it 2 months ago and I will say it again.

$HEGE will reach 100mil+ this bullrun!

So join our Telegram and take part in one of the comps to win a bag of $HEGE. And who knows, maybe you will end up making a lot of money.

SOL,Altcoin,Honest rating of memecoins pt. 5 ($HEGE),"I came across $HEGE few days ago and after joining their Telegram I had to ape in and I am glad I did because it went up by 100% in the last 3 days despite the fact whole market is red and Solana is at $130. But this is just a beginning and a lot more is coming.

**But first, let's take a look at our growth and achievements in the past 7 days:**

**Market cap-** 6M **➡️** 16M

**Holders-** 5800 ➡️ 6800

**X followers-** 6400 ➡️ 7400

**Telegram members-** 4300 ➡️ 4800

**1M all-time total impressions on X✅**

**15k donated to the CEX fees wallet✅**

You see? This shows that this is a real growth caused by the hard work of devs and community.

**But we all buy memecoins based mainly on their future, not their past, so let me just quickly tell you what's coming up and what I like about this project:**

**CEX listings and marketing push-** We are getting listed on 3 CEXs on Tuesday 25th. So from next week, you can easily buy $HEGE from an exchange anywhere in the world, including the US & EU! To help new investors find us, devs are developing a detailed marketing push for the day of listing.

**Competitions and giveaways-** Giveaways are common in memecoin space but $HEGE is a whole different story. Have you ever seen a community member give someone 7k? 7k dollars, not tokens!! Dev also held some giveaways and competitions so the total value of tokes distributed last week was $10k! And there are new ones coming this weekend.

* **Reddit competitions**- You can win up to 30k tokens ($400) for making reddit posts.

* **Twitter giveaway**- $500 will be distributed between 5 lucky people.

* **Tiktok competition**- Rules and prizes will be announced this weekend.

* **Raid to earn**- There are twitter raids happening every day. Most active people will be rewarded with tokens.

**More partnerships coming-** Big people from memecoin industry are starting to notice us. We have been mentioned by Rodney, CryptosRUs, Moneybags Rico and many more. We have also appeared in many big spaces of crypto influencers and other memecoin. That opens the door to bigger people, companies and CEXs. Dev is already cooking something, we don't know what it is yet, but I'm sure it will be HUUUUGE.

**Community commitments-**  

**J C:** ""IF WE HIT 20M THIS WEEK I WILL BUY AN ARIEAL AD FOR A PLANE TO FLY OVER THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN SAYING: SOLANA SUMMER - BUY $HEGE"" 

**Dutch1214:** “If hege reaches 10mil MC within a month i will tatto hege also LOL”

If you're searching subreddits for the next big coin of this bull run, stop and join the $HEGE FUND on Solana. And if you still do not feel convinced to buy $HEGE after reading this, join our tg or go through our website or Twitter to see for yourself. I can guarantee you will FOMO in after 5 minutes.

SOL,Altcoin,Will HEGE join the Billionaire boys club? ,"**What is $HEGE?**

Let's keep this short. $HEGE is a Solana coin launched back in April. It was created by a professional animator who was tired of losing money. This is why it outperforms 99,9% of coins in terms of high quality content. During these 2 months, we gained over 4,5k community members and over 6k holders. We created a strong base of our community with people from all walks of life. With a wide range of opinions from different people we are able to progress quickly. 

**What we have achieved so far**

So as I already said, we have 4,5k tg members with 30% increase in the last 2 weeks, 6000+ holders with 1000 new holders in the last 7 days. Our Twitter went from 3k to over 6k followers in just 1 week. We are gaining traction everywhere and our recent growth only confirms my statement. Our market cap was only 3M last Tuesday. Yesterday, we reached the new ATH which is now at 9,5M. Current market cap consolidates between 7M and 8M. We have also been invited and appeared in various crypto spaces of crypto influencers and other coins.

**What makes us stand out?**

Well, I don't even know where to start :D. First of all, our content and memes. It is hard to find a coin with no AI pictures but it is one of our rules. We do not want to post AI content, we want to do it all ourselves and make sure everything is high quality and exactly how we want it. Good and high quality memes are crucial to make it to the 100M club and to stay there. Second thing is a bit cliché but it is true. It's our community. I have bought a lot of coins in my life but I have never seen a community this active at only 8M market cap. They are constantly hyping each other, helping with everything and creating an insane vibe I absolutely love. This shows that we all believe in this project and that we are ready to bring it much higher than where it is right now.

**Future plans and outlooks**

It may look like we've already used all our tricks, but the opposite is true. This all was just the result of constant shilling, raiding and working for our bags in general. The real show starts now. We will appear in a huuuge space of a crypto influencer with 500k followers today, our first CEX listing is coming next week, HEGE Academy and much more content are in the process of making.

If you still do not feel convinced to buy $HEGE after reading this, join our tg or go through our website or Twitter to see for yourself. You can also listen to some of the previous spaces or join today's held by Travladd Crypto, crypto influencer with 500k followers. If you want to find out more, ask questions and I will try to answer them :).

SOL,Altcoin,$POWSCHE is giving away a real Porsche,"$POWSCHE on Solana is back on the track!! It is up by 450% since Sunday and still growing. To help this growth even more, dev decided to hold a real Porsche giveaway. That's right, one lucky $POWSCHE holder will win Porsche once we hit 10M market cap. And the best part is that you can win even with 1 $POWSCHE in your wallet!

**Let me tell you more about this giveaway.** 

All we know so far is that it will happen once $POWSCHE reaches 10M market cap and also how the winner will be chosen. Every participant gets 1 entry for every token he holds and also for every time his refferral is used or for every time he uses refferral of somebody else. No word yet on which Porsche will be competing but believe me when I say that this is something unique and will definitely push $POWSCHE even above 10M target. 

**But $POWSCHE is not just about this giveaway.** 

The marketing team wants to take an advantage of this growth and start pushing Twitter, Reddit, IG, Tiktok and maybe even some paid advertising as hard as possible. All these efforts along with the FOMO of everyone who sold during the dip will skyrocket us right into a new ATH. 

Always DYOR but I believe in $POWSCHE mainly because of the dev's insane strategy and a community that never gives up.

SOL,Altcoin,$HEGE update - Is it still early? ,"I made a post about $HEGE yesterday but due to our rapidly quick growth, I have to make another one today to keep you all updated about what is happening in our community and what has changed since yesterday. Fasten your seatbelts because this is going to be a hell of a ride!!

**So, what are the hottest topics in our community right now?**

Competitions and giveaways- There are 3 comps/giveaways running this weekend. Reddit competition, Tiktok competition and Twitter giveaway to celebrate our CEX listings. There are around 150k tokens in prices which is roughly $3,000. Join our Telegram if you want to find out more about them.

CEX listings- Our 3 CEX listings are not anything new and you have probably already heard about them. BUT, admins are already talking with other exchanges about potential listings in the future. Considering our market cap, volume, holders etc. I believe it is definitely CEX from top 15.

Marketing- We all believe in organic marketing, raiding and working for our bags but paid marketing is important if you want to play at a higher level and match coins like PONKE or even PEPE or SHIB. Our dev and admin team know that so they decided to start with paid marketing push next week on the day of our CEX listing.

Hollywood plane- JC, one of our community members, said earlier this week that if we reach 20M market cap by Sunday, he will pay for an airplane with a HEGE banner to fly over HOLLYWOOD sign. And guess what? We did it, JC is now preparing everything for this monumental moment because he is a man of his word.

**Now, let's take a look at our growth in numbers**

* Market cap: 14M > 25M
* Holders: 6800 > 7000
* Telegram members: 4700 > 4900
* Twitter (X) followers: 7200 > 8100
* 1M all-time total impressions on X achieved this week

# Conclusion

As you can see, we are taking this really seriously. Our community is full of diamond handed and hard working people and our hard work is finally paying off. We are reching new ATH every day and creating new floor much higher than the previous one, hundreds of new holders and community members are joining us every day and the best part is that this is just the beginning. We achieved all of this during red market! Solana is still at $130 but we did nearly 2x in the last 24 hours. So if you are tired of being rugged all the time and want to finally buy a promising memecoin with 50x or even bigger potential, buy a bag now because we are going much higher.

And if you want to do more research before buying, go through our website or join our Telegram to see for yourself what we are capable of.

SOL,Altcoin,13 Reasons Why You Should Hold a Fat Bag of $KENDU (Or Get One ASAP) - NFA,"https://preview.redd.it/4znedcfcrcad1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=349d39e376eea7ab1f77ba6aa50910706a6ffe9f

  


**1)  SHYTOSHI KUSAMA INVOLVED**

**Shiba Inu lead Dev Shytoshi Kusama**, considered among the **top 50** most influential people in the whole crypto space, is confirmed to be following Kendu Inu and holding a bag since at least $1M market cap.

**Kendu Miazaki**, Kendu Inu Dev, is one of his friends, and he made sure to bring Shy in at the right time.

 

 

**2)  HUGE WALLETS APING (MULTIMILLIONAIRES)**

Wallets with **10+ million dollars' worth of ETH** that had been inactive since the last cycle got back to life only to buy Kendu Inu.

It has even been confirmed that a **Middle Eastern Prince** holds a bag.

Other millionaires (and multimillionaires) are confirmed holders and part of the ecosystem as well.

 

 

**3)  KENDU MIAZAKI**

Kendu Inu Dev ""**Miazaki**"" is an unhinged individual always ready to rock & roll.

He is a **SHIB multimillionaire** (his bag was worth 50+ million dollars at ATH IIRC), and that explains the close connection with **Shytoshi** and other **SHIB Ogs** that are now part of Kendu.

Apart from his **incredible work ethic** and **crazy personality**, him being a loaded individual makes the project much easier to trust because one of the most common reasons for projects to fail is broke millionaire-wannabe devs who can't resist the urge of dumping on everybody to make a quick buck.

He recently admitted on a X Spaces that he doesn't even have that big of a bag. He said ""**I’m maybe top 20, if even that**”.

He always says he does not do this for money because he already has money. He does this because he likes to “**build**”  and to allow other common people to become “**stupid rich**”.

 

 

**4)  COMMUNITY**

What can I even say about the **Kendu Army**? Everybody knows about it.

With unmatched work ethic and always ready to spread the word, the Kendu Army is what makes Kendu…**KENDU**!

People who join Kendu go from being dirty, tiny-handed jeets to 7.6ft tall, muscular chads with strong and big hands.

You’re soon taught that success depends on you and to ask yourself, “**What can I do for $KENDU?**” instead of waiting for the team to release the “**next big thing**” and hoping for a pump while doing absolutely nothing to help.

**We’ve got relentless shillers** on any social media known to humanity, people making Kendu **energy drinks**, people managing a Kendu **merch store**, people with Kendu **tattoos**, people smashing plates on their heads in the name of Kendu, and much more.

**5)  ORGANIC GROWTH**

Kendu Inu fully believes in organic growth.

Apart from financing for the first **CEX** listing, so that “**normies**” were able to join the project without having to go through **DeFi** if not tech-savvy enough to avoid being scammed, **Kendu Inu does not pay for any listing, call on Tg, post on X, video on YT or any other thing you can think of**.

All the influencers that talk about Kendu or CEXs that listed us have had to buy supply from the liquidity pool like any other person.

Kendu Miazaki explained this from the very beginning.

“**It might be slower, but it works**.” is what he used to say.

**Organic growth allows you to build a strong floor of diamond-handed holders** who fully believe in the project and do not believe in random FUD.

On the other hand, if you build your floor with people sent by influencers, everybody is ready to jeet at the first chance because they’re just there for a quick buck and do not see the bigger picture.

 

 

**6)  UTILITY AND SHIB ECOSYSTEM**

Even though all details have yet to be revealed, it is known that **$KENDU** will play a role in the Shib ecosystem, which might explain Shytoshi’s involvement in Kendu Inu.

Make no mistake, though, Miazaki has always said that **Kendu has its own identity** and will not just be one of the small dogs existing under the SHIB umbrella.

One of the first Kendu utilities, named **Kendu Chads**, will be released in the following weeks after being thoroughly tested for months by Miazaki’s team of developers.

 

https://preview.redd.it/iizlff0bqcad1.jpg?width=1195&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a5643a5c028cd785132e6788480639d6bf2ebb6





**7)  THE DOG OF THIS CYCLE**

“Never two without three”.

People love dogs and always will. **DOGE** and **SHIB** were the first two dogs to reach **$10b**+ market cap.

**$KENDU** has everything it needs to be the third this coming bull run.

 

 

**8) 275M MARKET CAP WHEN THE MARKET WAS BLEEDING**

Kendu Inu reached an **ATH** of over **$275M market cap** when the whole crypto market, from BTC to all the shitcoins, was bleeding badly.

**Kendu is your hedge against the market** and will not wait for BTC to reach new ATHs before jumping to $1b market cap and beyond.

With that being said, when the actual bull run starts and all the random shitcoins are in green, what do you think will happen to a **strong project** like Kendu?

Multi billions are programmed.

 



**9)  BUILT ON ETH**

**Kendu Inu is only on ETH**. Love it or hate it, Ethereum is the king of all chains and sees fewer scams than all the other jeet chains such as SOL and BASE.

Since Kendu Inu is on ETH, and the liquidity pool is paired with ETH (KENDU:ETH), **when ETH goes up in value, so does KENDU**. As simple as that.

The news of the coming **ETH ETF** is super bullish news for all KENDU holders, both **short-term** and **long-term** investors.

 



**10)  GREAT-LOOKING CHART**

Even CMC, in their recent article, admitted that $KENDU chart looks very good and **on the verge of a breakout** from a pure TA standpoint, and they’re not aware of all the **alphas** behind the projects and all the future implementations that are going to be unveiled.

So, if you like technical analysis, you will like Kendu Inu chart.

**11)  GOAL: FIRST MEME COIN TO EVER CROSS $100b**

While every other project in the meme sphere tries hard to reach $1b market cap, at Kendu inu, we think that to be an embarrassing goal.

While Miazaki says that **“$10b is programmed**”, meaning it is inevitable, the real goal that excites our community is to be the first meme coin ever to cross $100b market cap.

Miazaki’s bio on Telegram says: “**Taking $KENDU to $100 BILLION and beyond!**”

Many experts expect this to be a “**super cycle**” and even more a “**meme super cycle**”, meaning we expect not only more liquidity to be deployed in the whole crypto space compared to 2021, but also that **meme coins will grab a much bigger % of that liquidity** flowing around compared to last cycle.

**We can then expect new ATHs for well-established projects** such as DOGE and SHIB, and that’s why, at KENDU, we’re working towards that $100b MC goal, which will not look as unrealistic at the peak of the bull run as it may does right now.

 



**12)  LOW MARKET CAP ≠ MORE GAINS**

Many people have been led to believe that the lower the market cap of a certain token, the better chance of making a 100x or 1000x. That is SO wrong and misleading.

90% or more of the “projects”, especially when launched on Solana or Base, **are complete scams**. Period.

The other 0.99% are projects created with the best intentions, but that, unfortunately, are going absolutely nowhere.

**Kendu Inu, at this stage, is bulletproof**. It has proved its value to everybody. “**We’re too big to fail**” is what Miazaki always says.

Kendu is going nowhere but up.

With such ambitious goals, a **100x means reaching about $15b market cap** (at the time of this writing), which is far from being out of reach for Kendu, especially considering we are about to enter what it’s supposed to be the **biggest cycle ever** (especially for meme coins).

Another thing to keep in mind is that when you invest in **super-low MC projects**, liquidity is so thin that any whale exiting their position leads to a cascade of sales caused by fear, especially since it’s not uncommon for investors of small projects to hold 5-10% of the total supply.

On bigger projects, instead, since liquidity is way thicker, you can **enter and exit your positions more accurately** without having nightmares about being rugged while asleep.

 

https://preview.redd.it/1a4row5fqcad1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ab676c8aab4bd351620875cf6b919d71522a86a

  


**13) BEAUTIFUL SUPPLY REDISTRIBUTION**

At Kendu Inu, redistribution is ongoing **24/7**. When the market cap goes up, the number of holders goes up. When the market cap goes down, even significantly, the number of holders still goes up!

And that’s counting on-chain holders only! **With millions of $ of daily volume on CEXs**, God knows how many holders we actually have.



To make money with altcoins, especially memes, you need to understand two things:

1. What a good project is
2. Buy when everybody else is afraid to do it.

Kendu IS a good project.

Now, you have the opportunity to buy or top up your bags at 40% of the ATH.



If you like Kendu, this is the best time to become part of the army. See you on the other side!

SOL,Altcoin,Project with the BIGGEST potential in the upcoming Bull-run.,"As crypto is becoming more mainstream, people are more than ever starting to invest in it. That means that now, besides crypto enthusiasts, we have more 'regular' people in the cryptocurrency space.
And as it turns out, 'regular Joes' LOVE Meme coins.

I know that there are crypto projects that are working on 'legit' utilities and real life purposes, but they aren't getting the same action and exposure that Meme coins are getting. It's just the way it is.
Could be a sign that the majority of the cryptocurrency space are now 'Regular Joes', which is not a bad thing (Mass adoption).

With that being said, we can conclude that Meme coins have MASSIVE potential in this upcoming bull run.
And home of the Meme coins is, whether some would like to admit it or not, Solana network. (Fast, secure, and nearly non-existent transaction fees).
Expected rise of the price of Solana in this upcoming bullrun will have a positive 'consequence' - Meme coins on Solana network will grow in price accordingly as well.

In the sea of Meme coin projects in Solana, there is one that stands tall and stand out - our boy $HEGE. 🦔

$HEGE started out on Reddit, and that is why we rightfully call it Hege's home.

Disclosure wise, I am a presaler on this project (65k MC), and in the moment of writing $HEGE's Market Cap is 16.5 million dollars.
Idea of selling never crossed my mind. Actually, I kept buying and adding to my bag as a firm believer of this project and its community.

In the Meme coin space, community and content (memes) is something that makes or breaks a project, not the other way around. And $HEGE has it all.

Community is strong, united, and most importantly, HEALTHY. You actually feel comfortable and pleased being in the TG groupchat (Our notorious HEGEQUARTERS).
You feel proud and like you're a part of something (Yes, it's possible. Even in this sea of scams and rug-pulls).
Besides TG Group and dedicated channels for different cultures, we got Discord server. Little bit of everything for everyone.

Content and memes part wise, $HEGE has BY FAR the best ones in the game, with all due respect to other projects.
Community and Dev. team is full of graphic designers and creative people, and that is the reason we dominate with the Content and Shilling material (And we'll only be getting better and better!).
Cheap and non-professional AI artwork is not something we do, and what you're used to seeing today.
Mentioned content and memes are then used by our hardworking community members, in relentless raidings we do.

As $HEGE is slowly getting the exposure he truly deserves, we got ourselves 3 CEX listings on the 25th of June.
BIG Marketing push is planned to follow up the CEX listings, which means that fun and exciting times are ahead of us.

It's nice being a part of something where you're not scared that your holdings went down to 0 overnight. We can proudly say we are rug-proof!

Feel free to check out our mentioned HegeQuarters (Telegram group), I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay and meet some wonderful people. We have a 100 Million Market Cap holders party planned out in London!

We're currently having a 500$ Giveaway! Head over to our official X account for more details.

I'll conclude this post with the following message;
Trust me when I say, it's still not too late to become a holder of this undervalued gem!

$HEGE Rocket WILL fly to a Billion dollar Market Cap either way, so you might as well join us on our journey. We'd be glad to have you! 🦔

SOL,Altcoin,HegeCoin ($HEGE) Skyrocketing,"Fueled by a strong grassroots movement, this ""Reddit-born"" coin is seeing remarkable growth. We've broken past our last resistance, and our returns are skyrocketing! New users are flocking in, determined not to miss out like they did with DOGE, SHIB, or WIF. Veteran community members often say HEGE’s vibe brings back memories of SHIB's early days. 

**Current stats:** 

- **Holders:** \~6,800 

- **Market Cap:** \~$12 million 

The HEGE community is truly outstanding. The passion and commitment here are exceptional. We're in this for the long run, not just a quick gain. The chart clearly indicates we have a solid project with a dedicated holder base ready to propel this to new heights. 

Our developer maintains high transparency, constantly involving the community in decisions. Besides being incredibly talented, they are also a top-notch graphic designer. People feel secure with Hege, and that trust is essential for our success. 

HegeCoin is about enjoying good times with our community, but we also have a roadmap that reveals Hege’s story, with new chapters unfolding at each market cap milestone. The higher we reach, the more intricate the chapters will be. It’s a very cool and unique concept.

SOL,Altcoin,I’ve held POWSCHE for 82d 14h 22m - Here's my thoughts,"My POWSCHE Journey: Why I'm Still Confident Despite the Ups and Downs

I've been holding POWSCHE for 82 days, 14 hours, and 22 minutes as I write this post.

I've watched POWSCHE soar to an all-time high of a $28 million market cap and plunge to $1.9 million. Like anyone, I've had my doubts, especially in the unpredictable memecoin space with all its rug pulls and false promises. But something about POWSCHE keeps my faith strong, and here’s why:

**1. Trustworthy and Transparent Leadership:**  

The developer, who is incredibly active and open about his past experiences in crypto, marketing, and life in general, had over $3.5 million in his wallet during POWSCHE's peak but didn’t sell a thing. He's participated in numerous “Ask Me Anything” podcasts and video chats, openly sharing his vision for POWSCHE and its origins rooted in a love for Porsches. This transparency and commitment from him and other major holders (whales) who have refused to cash out even when they could have become millionaires, speak volumes.

**2. Strong Community Relationships:**  

The POWSCHE community is tightly knit. It's like a circle of close friends—if we could achieve something spectacular and make a lot of money together, why would anyone sell out their friends to be the only one with millions? This camaraderie is evident in the top 10% of holders and beyond. Together, we can achieve so much more. Even when POWSCHE hits billions, the plan is to DCA (dollar-cost average) out profits as needed, ensuring stability and longevity for the coin.

**3. Organised and Professional Team:**  

The leadership team is structured like a corporation, with heads of departments managing specific areas like memes, videos, and marketing. It’s refreshing to see this level of organisation. The team consists of experts in their fields who are knowledgeable in the crypto space and always ready to help and advise. If you haven’t already, check out POWSCHE’s podcast on YouTube or Spotify—it’s pretty amazing and different from anything else out there.
Read more here about the Podcast:

[POWSCHE Podcast - On The Cusp - Episode 5 out now](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1dkzpo9/powsche_podcast_on_the_cusp_episode_5_out_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

**4. Exciting Real-World Initiatives:**  

I haven't even mentioned the Tesla and Lambo burns yet! Both events will be streamed live on Twitch for the world to see, which will undoubtedly attract more attention to POWSCHE. They also host numerous giveaways and have a referral program where you can earn POWSCHE. 
They’ve also announced Porsche giveaways to a lucky holder! Check out https://www.powsche.com/ for the full roadmap.

**5. Long-Term Vision:**  

I genuinely feel I’ve made a good decision with this investment. The memecoin space is highly competitive, but like any successful business, it's the ones that think outside the box, the innovators, the first movers (like the first car-themed memecoin) that truly make an impact and have longevity.

For all these reasons and more, I’m not worried. No more getting rugged or losing faith in the dev’s intentions. No more investing in generic cat or dog memecoins. None compare to POWSCHE’s dev, leadership team, and community.

Porsche, as a car brand, is recognisable, relatable, and aspirational, just like POWSCHE. I'm not chasing short-term gains; I want to be part of something that looks set to become a significant part of crypto history.

For just a couple of Solana, you could be involved too. My advice? Stop chasing pump-and-dump schemes for short-term gains. Get involved in something you can be truly proud of.

Buy POWSCHE now.   Sit back, Hold, Know you’re in safe hands.

SOL,Altcoin,Let's build a meme together. Will this work?,"After all my losses and failed attempts in crypto, I thought about creating a memecoin as a form of representation. At first, I wanted to call it ""Losers,"" but eventually, I changed the name to ""WorldofLosers."" My plan was to create an OpenbookMarketID, set up a liquidity pool, and somehow get it out to the community.

I always feel optimistic before starting something new, but I also get anxious. While setting up the OpenbookMarketID, I made a costly mistake and ended up losing 3 [SOL ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/)(around $600). That loss hit me hard, and I’m still working on forgiving myself for it. Ironically, it felt like the name of the coin reflected what had happened.

Later, I discovered pump fun, which made it possible to actually create my memecoin, WorldofLosers ($WOLOSR). Even though I was able to launch it, I still need support from the community to get people trading it. I’ve read that you need about 40 SOL to create enough trade volume and complete the bonding curve, but I don’t have that kind of funding or backing from friends.

So here I am, reaching out to you, fellow redditors. If you've experienced losses in investments that didn’t ruin your life but gave you something to laugh about, come trade $WOLOSR on pump fun. Let’s build this meme together. Who knows—maybe losers can be winners too! If the coin gains traction, I plan to build a website (I already own the domain) and grow the community

SOL,Altcoin,A Meme Coin Honoring Peanut the Squirrel Gains Popularity,"PNUT, a meme coin on the Solana blockchain, has quickly gained popularity, reaching a market cap of over $120 million within just three days of listing. Inspired by Peanut, a pet squirrel known for doing tricks in tiny hats on social media, the coin has struck a strong emotional chord with fans.  
  
The coin's exposure grew with its listing on Bitget, and shortly after, Binance announced it would list PNUT, sparking even more interest. This led to a significant rise in its market cap, from $129 million to $447.5 million, before stabilizing around $422 million, with a current price above $0.41.  
  
In addition to its growing popularity, Bitget is running a campaign where users can win $10–$20 worth of PNUT tokens by participating.   
  
At its core, PNUT shows that cryptocurrency can be about more than just profit. It taps into cultural moments and brings people together over shared emotions, proving how meme coins can build strong communities.

SOL,Altcoin,My moon bag for the next bull run," These are my bags for the next bull run. I already made over 10X, so I am convinced it will pump really hard. Some are based on utility, while others are just based on community hype.    


First on my list is Floki. Yeah,  it’s a meme, but the community is really strong, and they are doing a lot of charity programs in Africa, which means they have good VC backing. I think it might flip Shiba, and it's just about 2B MC.  

The second is QANX; it’s a possible 100X; this one has utility; and its blockchain just got adopted by a country in the EU, which I believe is a huge buy signal. Now that a country has started using blockchain because of its security, I believe banks might get in too soon, and you know what they say: follow where the money goes.   

The last, but not least, is SOL. I wrote a thread a few months ago about this, and whoever ever bought SOL with me at $10 will be in huge profit now. IMO, SOL might flip ETH, as we can see many are beginning to jump on it, and the new memecoin trend will be in the SOL ecosystem rather than ETH.  

Anyway, feel free to share with me what you are holding so I can add that to my list of coins to research   
[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/qanplatform/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/qanplatform/)

SOL,Altcoin,Here are my top altcoin picks for next year," As you can see, there is a high chance of having a bull run soon, as BTC has shown a good price move to the upside for several months now. IMO, it's wise to start accumulating gradually.  

But the real question is what to buy and why I think it’s the best option. I will only be listing the two tokens I’m accumulating now. One is a large cap, and the other is a low cap. Both are my biggest bags, and if you do proper research, you will agree with me that they have a high chance of leading the next bull run.  

The first is SOLANA; it's funny because I personally FUD SOL a few months ago before it had that huge price move back up. Recently, I have noticed SOL has started gaining a lot of traction, and memecoin is now gradually shifting from ETH to the Solana ecosystem. If this trend continues, then a lot of people will end up buying into SOL, and I predict the price will be around $500 for its next ATH.   

The second, which is a low-MC gem and is gradually gaining traction, is QANX. It’s a layer 1 hybrid blockchain that is EVM-compatible. One of the features about it that I feel will blow up so much is the fact that it allows developers to code smart contracts in any programming language, which QAN aims to use to onboard over 20 million developers into the blockchain, which I believe even If they are able to achieve 10% of that, then this layer 1 blockchain will be greater than ETH. And my price prediction for QANX is $1 in the next bull run.  

Anyway, please feel free to share with me what altcoins you are buying as well.

SOL,Altcoin,A synopsis of crow with knife ($CAW) - Why it's worth looking into,"crow with knife ($CAW) has huge upside potential in what will be the biggest memecoin season ever this bullrun. 

Memecoins are a dime a dozen at the moment, the market is absurdly oversaturated. Caw is different though, not just because it's actually a famous meme but also because of the following points: 

100% circulating supply since day 1- devs bought in at the same price as everyone else. Contract renounced, code cannot can be altered, no more tokens Mintabie. 

Available on Solana, Base, Cronos, Polygon, and the Binance Smart Chain, as well as 2 centralised exchanges, all from the same supply of 777 trillion tokens total across all chains. Caw-specific bridges make it easy to bridge tokens across chains. 

Currently 48m market cap, about 40% of ATH. Huge liquidity pool, currently 3.8m on cronos. 2.5m-3m of this is owned by VVS (dex on cronos) who has locked it for the next 11 months (was part of an agreement for a token VVS released about a month ago where you could pay with CAW, they would match it with CRO and add to LP and lock for 1 year). Liquidity on other chains continuing to build. 

Ridiculously healthy coin distribution. Of the top 10 wallets - 

Wallet #1 is owned by crypto.com 

Wallet #2 is owned by crypto.com 

Wallet #3 is also owned by crypto.com 

Wallet #4 is the VVS dex LP 

Wallet #5 is a bridge address 

Wallet #7 is the burn wallet 

10.5k holders on cronos, 2.2k on solana, 1.3k on base. Indeterminate number holding via crypto.com app/exchange and bitmart (though crypto.com and their users own around 40% of the supply right now so there are a *lot*. 

Listed on crypto.com and bitmart, another top 10 CEX fundraise is in progress right now and about 65% of the way there. Community has contributed 100% of the listing fees for payments so far as there is no reserved marketing wallet (read: no risk of being dumped on) Currrently $100k raised in just over a week, with another $120k in the treasury from a prior fundraise. This will be a legitimate, tier 1 centralised exchange, not some pump and dump fake volume mill. 

[Verified circulating supply by coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crow-with-knife/). [On coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crow-with-knife). Whitelisted in coinbase wallet and on solana dex aggregator Jupiter's strict list (no need to import contract addresses) 

Fanatical, cult-like community across discord, telegram, Twitter, reddit. Every day is a flurry of activity, memes degen humour, inside jokes, shitposting. The discord in particular is an absolute zoo and ridiculously compelling. This is mixed with genuine, wholesome support- rallying behind crows going through hardship like bereavement and donating to those who have been drained by scammers. 

The memes. Dear God the memes. Endless, dizzying, constant memes, not just basic image macros but insane numbers of photoshops, art, gifs, videos, music. Relatable and enjoyed by normies- I had a quote tweet by Ice-T a few days ago which was liked by hundreds of non-crypto users https://twitter.com/FINALLEVEL/status/1801558231547822273?t=lvVej_BCcHfFVCaHg9R8nA&s=19 

Oh yes and the coin is 3 months old as of Saturday 15th. 

Come check out the discord (https://discord.com/invite/cz9j7Yr2) or subreddit (r/crowwithknife). Links for contract addresses etc. available there and also on www.crowwithknife.com

SOL,Altcoin,FRED Raccon best Community Meme ,"  
with a heavy heart Today, I want to share with you a story that's both heartwarming and heart-wrenching, centered around a unique meme coin on the Solana blockchain called **$FRED**  
  
  
Fred was not just any raccoon; he was a beloved resident of a wildlife sanctuary in Pine City, living a life that many of us wish for our wild friends - safe, cared for, and loved. However, life took a harsh turn for Fred and his squirrel friend, P'Nut, when the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) intervened, leading to both animals being taken from their sanctuary. Sadly, Fred was euthanized, leaving behind a legacy and a movement.  


In honor of Fred's memory, **$FRED** was created on the Solana blockchain. This meme coin doesn't just play into the fun, speculative nature of crypto markets; it carries a message. It symbolizes:  
  
\-Animal Welfare: The coin aims to raise awareness and possibly funds for animal rescue and rehabilitation.  
\-Community Support: With every transaction, there's a narrative of standing up for those who can't speak for themselves, it's listed on Bitget with a community Giveaway to win upto free 30$   
  
\-Memorializing Fred: Every time you hold or trade $FRED, you're keeping the spirit of Fred alive, promoting discussion on animal rights, and how we treat our wildlife.  
\-Meme with a Mission:Unlike many meme coins that exist purely for speculation, $FRED has a narrative that resonates, encouraging a community around a cause.  
  
Let’s come together to remember Fred, support animal sanctuaries, and perhaps find a new way to invest in crypto that feels right. $FRED isn't just another coin; it's a symbol of what community and crypto can achieve when they align for a cause.  
  
Feel free to share your thoughts, experiences If you're in the fred community

There’s likely to be big demand for XRD because it’s the primary token of the Radix blockchain, which is a highly specialized decentralized ledger that’s purpose built for DeFi. Unlike other blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana, Radix follows what it calls an “asset-oriented” approach to DeFi, in which cryptocurrency tokens and NFTs are treated as native assets on its platform.

SOL,Altcoin,$URO price chart looking good but could this be the beginning of a DeSci Memecoin evolution?,"It is obvious that Blockchain has revolutionized every industry including science. Currently, memecoin is trending in the industry and it seems even DeSci is now getting involved. Could this novel intersection between biotechnology, health, and cryptocurrency change the landscapt? $URO, known as Urolithin A, has emerged as an intriguing meme coin within the realm of decentralized science (DeSci). The Solana meme token embodies the health and anti-aging potential which is why it is currently trending in Pump Science platform.

Urolithin A is a metabolite produced by the gut microbiota from ellagitannins found in foods like pomegranates, berries, and nuts. Its discovery has piqued interest due to its promising health benefits, particularly in the field of aging and longevity. Research has shown that Urolithin A can enhance mitochondrial function, a process known as mitophagy, where damaged mitochondria are recycled, promoting cellular health and potentially extending lifespan. This compound has been linked to increased muscle strength, reduced inflammation, and improvements in metabolic health, showcasing its anti-aging attributes.

Notably, analysts on twitter havce start hyping the project and predicting of a DeSci memecoin trend since Bitget and other top exchange have already listed the token. The price chart is looking good but could this signal a DeSci memecoin revolution?

SOL,Altcoin,"It's an open discussion, what are your plans ahead of the coming bull run, are you buying anything now or not?","I remembered the last bear market when a friend advised me to buy ETH, but I was hesitant. My first purchase later was around 3000, and I planned to hold to 10K if possible, but the bear market had other plans. To avoid repeating the same mistake, I've decided to conduct research, compile a list of a few good crypto projects that I believe will lead the next bull run, and then ask you guys to vote on which ones you think are good and which ones you think are bad.

The first on my list is potential Solana. I know some people don't like it because of centralization issues and the fact that it has had a few shutdowns, but I believe it's a great blockchain with a lot of great potential. I have DCA from $60, and I may still buy more. Some advantages of SOL include its high scalability, which makes Solana a better blockchain for Dapps such as DEXs and staking protocols.

The following is DOT. Polkadot should not be overlooked either, as it has a fantastic community. It is designed to allow unrelated blockchains to securely interact with one another, allowing value or data to flow between blockchains without the need for an intermediary. It's also intended to be fast and scalable, thanks to the use of numerous parallel blockchains or ""parachains"", that offload much of the processing demand from the main blockchain. Dot has an ATL of $2.69, so buying at $6.27 now isn't a bad idea. I just want to start DCA-ing DOT this month.

I also discovered a low-cap project called Qanplatform. It's a layer 1 quantum-resistant blockchain, which you may have heard of. It recently released QVM, which allows developers to code smart contracts in any programming language. In comparison to EVM, which only allows programming in Solidity, this could be huge for the crypto space in general. It also has several other USPs, such as the quantum-resistant features I mentioned above, which make this chain one of the most secure ever and not hackable by a Quantum computer. I've had DCA-ing QANX since it was 0.014, and I'll be buying more this month to hold for the long term.

The fourth one is MoonRiver, an Ethereum-compatible, smart-contract parachain on Kusama. It is intended to be a companion network to Moonbeam, where it will provide a permanently incentivized canary network. The token name is MOVR and it has several utilities for this decentralized smart contract platform.  I did buy some for around $15 and am still looking for more if possible.

The last one is a meme called TSUKA. It has the same founder as Shiba and I will be gambling in on that, hopefully, it will become the next Shiba.

So guys, what do you think, I’m I good to go? Do I need to add any other gem before the bull run, let me know in the comment section

SOL,Altcoin,This project is promising. Big CEX listings and HUGE Marketing push this week!,"In the meme coin space, a project has to tick multiple boxes in order to have a chance of succeeding in the long term.

We're not talking about **5,000% overnight gains** that translate to a **99.99% loss the next day.** We're talking about projects that grow the best way— **the slow and organic way.**

**Multiple factors determine the quality of a meme coin:** Name (+ticker), Theme of the coin, Content, Leading team (developer + team), and the most vital component— community. **And $HEGE has it all!**

**Name—** I mean, how can you not love the name ""Hege""? Short, simple, and insanely catchy. **You'll remember it, whether willingly or not!**

**Theme of the coin—** Determines how easy it is to market the coin and make memes for it; and low-hanging Hege the hedgehog is one heck of a theme! Slap Hege on anything, and you basically have a funny, attention-grabbing meme. The ideas are limitless.

**Content—** I strongly believe that Hege has reached a level where its content is better than its most similar project content-wise - Ponke's. Animations (especially Chapter 4) and memes are only getting better and more professional. **Maybe we will make an animated movie at a certain Market cap!**

**Leading team—** May the results and their work speak for themselves; **They know how to manage.** Constant giveaways, constant competitions where the most active and creative members have a chance to **EARN while working for their bags**, constant new animations and memes. We're even having a $1,000 Riddle Giveaway (for additional information head over to our official X account) that is ending today, so take a chance with your detective skills, it would be worth it! **Alongside mentioned, team is dedicated and working on technical stuff as well - CEX Listings, partnerships and similair.** So far they've done a great job (4 CEX Listings, PAAL partnership, and more).

**Community—** I'm not overexaggerating when I say that the Hege community is the healthiest community out there. It feels nice being a part of something that doesn't hate or bring down others, but is focused ONLY on positive energy and building itself up. **We're united and hardworking, which is why you've seen us a million times, and why you'll KEEP SEEING US.**

**Community proved the legitimacy of the project by raising a $120,000 in a record time!** The money raised will be used for a BIG CEX listing (last time we were pleasantly surprised and got listed on not 3 but 4 CEXs!). **In addition to the mentioned $120,000, we have a marketing wallet with $90,000 in it.**

We're having a **$HEGE MANIA** week where we'll be deploying a full-out marketing push (we got funds for some **serious** exposure!) that will follow a BIG CEX listing (or listings!). And the fun thing is, Hege Mania starts **TODAY!**

I've said it before, and I'll say it again. There's no project like Hege.

We've got everything it takes for a billion-dollar Market cap, and all we need is a bit of luck. **With our hard work, we're placing ourselves in a position where luck will easily find us!**

An insanely fun week, or rather a conquest, full of action and events, lies ahead for every $HEGE holder.

**Why watch from the sidelines? Join us on our journey to the number one spot.**

You'll surely be rewarded for it!

SOL,Altcoin,Wealth Creation of Bitget on BAN after Binance Listing ,"The listing of $BAN on Binance indicates a major step towards mainstream crypto recognition, potentially attracting a larger, more diverse investor pool. However, Binance's regulatory challenges might be a concern for some investors.

$BAN has seen significant price jumps, moving from a market cap of $170M to $290M in a short span, showcasing high volatility and interest, which is typical for newly listed cryptocurrencies on major exchanges, Bitget traders made use of this Opportunity. 

BAN was listed on Bitget 20 days (3 weeks) before Binance (Futures) and it has surged significantly creating wealth for those who've bought on Bitget 
tolerance.

Each platform brings different strengths to the table for $BAN, with Binance offering broader market access and Bitget providing a specialized trading environment.

SOL,Altcoin,$HEGE has been reaching for previous ATH and here are some reasons why:,"Why $HEGE is a long-term hold, and not your usual short-term meme project. Time to rotate those profits into $HEGE!

No I'm not chatgpt or a bot so get that out of your system first, random guy who always comes here. 

Now onto it. $HEGE was born as the anti-rug, the anti-scam, a way to gain trust of those who were rugged before, and as a safe haven for those new to memecoins. Due to that same attitude, we work hard to make sure your money is as safe as it can be, well, in a memecoin space that is. From shrimps to whales.

Because of that, we've made long-term plans to develop this project into something that'll last—not based on a cultural zeitgeist, a fleeting election, a literal photo of an animal—but something new. Every bull market will bring new people and with it—new scammers. $HEGE will be here to help them, to create a community to guide them. $HEGE will be there to make sure your profits from those pump and dumps you got lucky on are safe. Here are things the team and community at $HEGE are doing to make this last:

1. Nobody single person can rug this coin—our liquidity is high, and no one person has enough. We know, our whales have disclosed and once larger CEX listings come, have volunteered to lock a large portion of their $HEGE (I am one of them).

2. Real utility—the $HEGE Academy. While in early stages, the team (current animators, former teachers, and more) are putting together an ""academy"" that will teach newer folks how to identify scams among many other things. As a former teacher, I'll be helping develop the curriculum myself.

3. Roadmaps, marketing debriefs, transparency. Not gonna lie—we had a bumpy time earlier. We were about to start a marketing push when a few unlucky things happened. The team, not wanting to waste the $26k the community raised, stopped the marketing and pivoted strategies. Afterward, they published a marketing debrief, admitting what went wrong and how they were going to fix it. As you can see, it worked. We're up 300% since then! This dedication will continue and as we speak, roadmap #2 is being worked on.

4. CEX listings. We are starting small with TooBit, so that we can dip our feet in as a small MC (7.3m now). We have a plan to continue listing on larger CEXs as MC increases, as it seems logical. These listings will increase the base and give more stable volume as time goes on. A blue chip of memes, if you will.

5. Just, the community itself. You've seen us on Reddit. We're relentless, even when times are tough. We don't give up on our investments or your investments. Go on dexscreener and see how many coins have absolutely zero plan—even big MCs. It's why you'll see them fade over a very quick time or a slow death. Because they rode a wave and didn't actually care about the coin's development. We aren't that. We have been through a movie-worth of struggles. We don't give up. 


TLDR; buy $HEGE, rotate profits, and get your next 50x because this is a safe investment—well, for a memecoin.  Find our TG and other socials at hegecoin.com, see our X, and you'll understand the quality we offer.

SOL,Altcoin,"Following $PONKE's early days, the bottom for $HEGE is in — A prime time to buy before a massive reversal!","

$HEGE has found the ultimate floor, mimicking the exact actions of $PONKE and $KENDU after their falls following their first 10x. And we're about to reveal something that I think is potentially revolutionary in the memecoin space. 

Depending on who you are, yesterday was either awesome or scary. For people who want to get rich and understand the memecoin ecosystem, it was a chance to buy a dip and immediately be up 50% on it. For people who don't understand memecoins and the way they can move, it was probably scary. But scared money don't make money. Momma didn't raise no scared money. 

$HEGE had insane support after a presaler sold his whole stack in only two sells—each over $30k and $40k each. For a low MC coin, that's a helluva lot and it hurt. However, what really proved that $HEGE is here to stay, and is only getting stronger, was the rebound. The Telegram was absolutely endless with buy after buy after buy, hundreds coming in. In a matter of hours, we nearly recovered fully from the presaler and the following sales. It was madness, but those who bought that dip all the way to $3.7m are now already up significantly as we sit at $5.2m.

You might be thinking—damn, didn't $HEGE get to $30 million? Why's it at $5m? You'd be right, we did. And $PONKE went to $4.5m after hitting $43.4m. $SHIB lost 99% of its value before it blew up. $HEGE is a quality project. We got a team of animators working every day to pump out quality content. Our socials are growing at insane rates—YouTube, IG, etc. all at rapid speed. We aren't going anywhere, and whales selling just give you all a chance to hop in a quality project for higher upside. You probably look at these higher MC coins and think ""damn, the upside with those just isn't there. I need to find one early.""

Well, you found $HEGE, and you're early. So hop on in.

SOL,Altcoin,Sneak Preview of Syscoin NEVM,"**TL;DR**

Some of you here know about the sleeping giant that is Syscoin (currently celebrating its 7th birthday this week) 🥮

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/syscoin/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/syscoin/)

Well my friends, today is the day the Syscoin team unveiled the first screenshots of their NEVM! (""Network Enhanced Virtual Machine"") As a matter of fact, the NEVM is currently live on a private testnet, & the public testnet phase is anticipated approximately three weeks from now. Heard enough? Go 👀 the screenshots on the official blog post!

[https://syscoin.org/news/syscoin-platform-news-update](https://syscoin.org/news/syscoin-platform-news-update)

**I'm Intrigued, Tell Me More**

By launching the NEVM, Syscoin will be unique in that it will not only have *Turning Complete smart contracts* (and have the ability to port over contracts from ETH), but it is also merge-mined with Bitcoin, so you get the decentralized smart contract & DeFi capabilities of ETH, plus the hardened security of Bitcoin (did you know that Syscoin has the second highest hashrate of any coin ... period?) 💪 Also of note: the speeds are insane, scalability is through the roof\* & that fees (to mint NFTs, gas, etc) are microscopically tiny. \*audited by Whiteblock",73,2021-08-19 22:18:13,140

This coin was created by BONK top holders to level up game development on the Solana network and to on-board the next wave of web2 gamers into web3.

This coin is still in its early stage when insiders and few lucky people like you are buying and securing supply for the long term. That is why the chart looks like S&P 500 on steroids.

But very soon, when the whole market reaches new ATHs and ordinary people (including gamers) start buying crypto, the Dev will start with paid marketing, collaborations, listings and many more.

This is the time for everyone who wants to front-run big KOLs and people that will buy after collabs. The market cap is around 13M which might seen high but in reality there is still 40x potential thanks to the connections with BONK.

Always DYOR but I started buying this coin at 5M market cap and I have kept buying small amount since then. It is up to you if you will make it. It is not luck or connections. It is hard work and researching projects like this one every day.

SOL,Altcoin,Why it matters to be recognisable in the memecoin space,"We all love a cute dog or cat and they can appeal to many, but what makes these coins any different to each other?   You see memecoins popping up everyday and it’s this dog or this cat, one with a hat, one without, these are all great and I am sure some may even do well, but i’m not sure if they are starting to lack originality?  Please share your thoughts in the comments about this….

That’s why when I came across POWSCHE, I thought to myself, this is different, this is original and it is very recognisable, memorable and appealing. 

Who hasn’t dreamed of one day owning a car like a Porsche?   You might even prefer Lambos, Ferraris or even a Buggattis, but Porsche has always been respected and appreciated for it’s unique look and German engineering, it’s a brand that hasn’t ever shied away from competing with the other luxury sports cars.  It’s a brand that is prestigious.

So when it comes to being recognised and memorable, it’s POWSCHE that is going to come out on top, thats what makes me really bullish about POWSCHE, to add to this it’s the first car coin in Crypto, first to market means a lot, category defining means a lot. 

As POWSCHE becomes more known, it will be the choice of many in the general public just due to how relatable it is in the real world, the thought of being able to buy a Porsche with POWSCHE will be really appealing to the masses.

This coupled with the fact that POWSCHE is planning to burn a Tesla followed by a Lambo is going to send POWSCHE viral, bringing millions of eyes to the coin. 

The Porsche giveaways are pretty insane too, community members have the chance to win, again, this is sure to go viral bringing even more eyes to POWSCHE. 

I’ve invested a couple of Solana in POWSCHE, it’s a great entry at the moment.  I’ll let it sit and won’t sell any, it has gone up where i’ve been making profit and has gone down a few times where i’ve been making a loss, but I am not worried in the slightest, if anything, I know the Dev and the team are pushing it hard everyday, navigating this space isn’t easy and you need a strong team and community like there is at POWSCHE.   

I’m still doing some short term trades on a few memecoins, you know the ones that are really hyped up, the Tates and the Trumps etc, all good make a bit but you can’t leave your money in there too long, none of them last and they are left to rot with the false promises coming through a couple of times in the not so active Telegram groups.  

POWSCHE has proven that it is here to stay, the team are relentless around the clock and are always thinking out of the box to attract more attention, they are a blueprint for other memecoins on Solana.

From VC backing and revolutionary NFTs with an actual utility, to a full-out marketing campaign, $HEGE has a lot in store. Let’s dive right in into the exciting news and upcoming events!

**If you’re unfamiliar with $HEGE, let me give you a quick introduction:**

*Hege is a meme coin on the Solana network and the first project to take a storytelling approach to cryptocurrency.* Our concept centers around our boy Hege, a hedgehog on a quest to win the heart of his dream girl, Hegena. We use this unique and relatable narrative to connect with our community, and as we hit certain market cap milestones, we unlock new chapters of the story! But Hege isn’t just about price speculation or quick profits. *We’re building a fun and interactive project—a place where holders can truly engage and be part of a healthy and supportive community.* We’re often called bots, which says a lot about our dedication: people can’t believe how hardworking and devoted we are. And this is just the beginning of what we can achieve!

**With the rise of meme coins and community driven tokens, it’s clear that Hege is playing into the trend, but with a slightly more structured and narrative-driven spin than most - with all due respect to most!**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# VC-backing:

**Victus Capital, a leading venture capital firm specializing in the crypto sector, is investing between $300K and $500K into our project!** This isn’t just about the funding; it’s a strong endorsement from a firm that’s collaborated with top-tier exchanges, crypto-friendly businesses, and has an impactful marketing strategy.

Victus Capital’s support is only the beginning, as this partnership will only open the doors to more partnerships, deals and opportunities for the project!

# Revolutionary NFTs:

![img](hg3n29x2w8od1 "" 2,222 uniquely generated Hegends on the Solana network.
Drawn by hand and assembled by code, no two Hegends are the same. "")

&#x200B;

**A HegeCoin NFT collection** was planned and teased at the inception of the HegeCoin project in early April. According to plan, the NFT would be released once the $10 million market cap was surpassed. Having reached that milestone, we are pleased to introduce the widely anticipated Hegends NFT collection.

[\\""HEGENDS\\"" - The official NFT collection of $HEGE coin.](https://reddit.com/link/1fel81a/video/97o9ay94w8od1/player)

&#x200B;

There are 2 NFT sets, the whitelist set and the main set. The whitelist set was distributed to HegeCoin donors (“Friends of Hege” members) and will entitle holders to mint a number of main set NFTs depending on donor tier. Additional whitelist spots were available to claim by the public/non-donors. *The main set will consist of 2,222 unique NFTs with traits of varying rarity.* While there will be future benefits of holding the whitelist NFT, this document will focus on the main set.

**With a total of 2,222 NFTs available, they will be distributed amongst the following groups:**

&#x200B;

* 600 for whitelist members
* 100 for influencers
* 600 maximum for project treasury
* 922 for main sale

The project treasury will be kept by the project for distribution as rewards for community members or for marketing purposes in the future. *No more than 90 NFTs from the project treasury will be released per quarter.*

**Whitelisting will be facilitated through the HEGE official discord.** Those on the whitelist are encouraged to review/communicate there for minting details. If whitelist positions are still available, they can be claimed by going to the whitelist channel and requesting a position on the list.

**14 Guardians of Hege are responsible for contributing greater than $250k in project donations. Their donations have made the HegeCoin project possible. For their contributions, Guardians will receive an NFT with a 1-1 trait, to commemorate their commitment to HegeCoin.**

&#x200B;

**Utility**

**Holders of the NFT will be entitled to certain benefits.** While more benefits will be announced in the future, a benefit we would like to announce immediately is the Hege dividend.

When an NFT is initially minted, a certain percentage of the purchase (see NFT Proceeds section for breakdown) is deposited into an NFT bank. This NFT bank will be used to purchase $HEGE. **Every month, 2% of Hege tokens in the bank will be distributed amongst NFT holders.** Each NFT held will entitle a holder to the same distribution from the bank (and if a holder has 10 NFTs, they will get 10X the distribution versus a holder who has 1 NFT). This will have 2 major benefits:

&#x200B;

* *This provides a floor price for the NFT.* The more valuable the $HEGE token becomes, the more valuable the NFT becomes due to the increased dividend distribution.
* *Provides an initial boost to the $HEGE price.* Since the funds in the NFT bank will be used to purchase $HEGE, this will provide a nice boost to the token.

**Additionally, when an NFT is bought or sold in the future (when it changes wallets), there will be a transaction tax. 4% of the total sale amount will be deposited into the NFT bank, used to purchase $HEGE, and thus increase the future dividend amount.**

NFTs listed for sale on the distribution date will not be eligible for the distribution. *Also, the wallet holding the NFT must also hold a minimum of 100 HEGE tokens. The holding requirement is primarily in place to prevent the need to create a token account for the wallet, which would increase fees and potentially minimize the overall distribution value.*

NFTs will be categorized in 5 standard rarity tiers: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. The dividend payment will vary based on the tier with the rarest tier having the highest dividend payment. Below is a breakdown of the tiers with the dividend payments:

[Detailed explanation.](https://preview.redd.it/itywzap7w8od1.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdeabab19d10c84d33340b25b846eb3a6514b1a4)

&#x200B;

**NFT Proceeds**

NFT Proceeds come from two areas, the initial minting of the NFT, and future buys and sells of the NFT. When an NFT is originally minted, there will be a minting cost.

The proceeds of this will be distributed accordingly:

15% of the proceeds will be deposited into the NFT bank, 10% of the proceeds will be set aside to develop future utility for the NFT, and 75% of the proceeds will be used for HegeCoin project expenses including, but not limited to operations and marketing costs. As mentioned above, the NFT Bank will be used to pay NFT holders a 2% monthly dividend.

**Royalties**

When an NFT is purchased or sold, there will be a 8% royalty on the overall transaction. Of that 50% will go into the project wallet and 50% will go into the NFT bank.

[The NFT Collection - How it works.](https://preview.redd.it/8mmoat89w8od1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=052befecbc2bd8b98121db40edcf644fbad1f330)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Besides NFT launch we’re expecting on the September 19th (presale September 17th), **Gate.io (the 7th largest CEX globally) and Bitvavo have both shown interest in our project and informed us that we’re on their watchlist.** If we keep progressing as we are, we could be listed on both exchanges in the near future. This would expose $HEGE to a huge number of new users and could bring the project to new heights.

[$HEGE x Gate.io x BitVavo](https://preview.redd.it/uur95wnaw8od1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebfd30964acf2a3e48ad34450ba54b34d76d4afc)

&#x200B;

# The Social Media Tool:

**The latest social media tool is showing great potential!** It developed over 40 videos that effectively promote $HEGE, *tailored to perform well with different short form social media algorithms* (TikTok, Instagram reels ,Youtube shorts). Each video comes with more than 100 unique variations, and as a result, every video will appear completely original to social media algorithms! More about the tool here:  **https://x.com/HegeCoin/status/1833359312053256275**

# Two new partnerships:

&#x200B;

**IceCreamSwap -** This is a DEX using the Neon EVM which allows developers to build and deploy Ethereum-native apps on Solana. The Neon team reached out to us to join in a partnership to bridge our token to the Neon chain. This will allow our token to be traded and used on the Neon chain. ***This partnership is free for $HEGE, but will bring us added visibility from not only announcements and tweets by Neon Labs and Ice Cream Swap, but by being available for use on their chain.***

**Wing Swap -** Several weeks ago, we were on an AMA with Wing Swap ***(this was the one who's project's co-founder was the saxophonist for Pink Floyd)***. They really liked our project, we really liked them and are now entering into a larger partnership. The opportunities are endless, but **over the next few weeks, the Wing Swap application will be released and will allow $HEGE to be purchased directly using credit cards or bank debit for United States, Australia, and New Zealand citizens.** This will allow normies in these countries to very easily purchase $HEGE without going through CEXs or DEXs. This will be huge, especially for Americans who do not have access to the CEXs that we are listed on. They will now a very easy way to acquire $HEGE!

&#x200B;

I will conclude this post with an intriguing fact: despite challenging market conditions, Hege has managed to thrive. **Since June 1st, Hege has been one of the few meme coins to deliver a positive return!** More about this here:  [***https://x.com/HegeCoin/status/1832117898569249096***](https://x.com/HegeCoin/status/1832117898569249096)

SOL,Altcoin,InvestDex.io - The most advanced All-In-One Crypto Trading Station,"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/investdex

InvestDex is a multifaceted crypto token organization platform that equips traders with the tools to effectively manage their trade workflow, acquire or sell tokens securely, and manage such token acquisition or sale strategically while keeping a close watch on the pulse of the cryptocurrency market.

InvestDex is the first-of-its-kind workstation with a special focus on the DeFi Space, essentially making trading easier and more structured. By combining traditional task management software with the most advanced data available on the market, InvestDex’s purpose is to let you visualize, manage, and organize your assets, so traders can gain an edge on the market and strategize their investments in a well-organized manner.

The project launching was postponed with 3 months by the team and instead of raising funds early, they first preferred to develop their product and to start with confidence in this entrepreneurial journey. The project launched on 15th of June on Pancakeswap right after the completion of its triple IDO on TosDis, DuckStarter and BSCPAD. It was sold out in a matter of minutes. It’s important to notice that the amount of funding from VC’s was limited, preferring instead to give an opportunity to the community to enter at the seed sale stage. All early rounds of funding have been heavily vested to protect all of the investors from heavy selling pressure at listing. The contract address (0x853A8Ab1c365ea54719EB13A54d6B22F1fBe7FEb) is audited by SolidGroup and 75% of the liquidity is locked with Unicrypt. The other 25% are reserved for a pool on ETH which will bring Uniswap and cross-chain in a due time.

The next 2 weeks are free of charge using the platform. The payment of subscription fees will only be handled in the native INVEST token by connecting your Metamask wallet. Furthermore, InvestDex introduces a tiered system, where people who hold a predefined amount of INVEST tokens or who provide liquidity will qualify for discounts on monthly subscription fees as well as additional services.

In addition to all of this, InvestDex maintains a deflationary system where 50% of the tokens collected from subscription fees will be burned for the first six months and 15% of these fees will be burned the following year. The users of InvestDex will enjoy the sexiest UI in the space and a lot of advanced features that will help them to stay organized and to increase their wealth. Some of the features are:

* Pair Explorer
* Pool Explorer
* Real time data charts
* Multi Swap
* New listings Explorer
* Whale Watcher
* Workstation (Coming soon)
* Account Scanner
* Portfolio
* Unlimited favorites & Alerts
* Interactive Calendar
* Risk Management Calculator/Analysis
* ETH Vs BTC Comparison
* Telegram Bot Access (Coming soon)
* Integrated Tools (Coming soon)
* Integrated Limit Orders (Coming soon)
* Wallet Tracker (Coming soon)

The Whale Watcher is a feature that allows the users to filter High Volume trades( $10K + ) tracking Whales and their movements..Its very handy tool as you can copy their trades. It can be also filtered by volume of the transactions. Generally the Whales are in the know and this can be a lucrative trading strategy. There is also an implemented feature New Token Listing. It's a dedicated page to show all new token listings on that particular DEX. The next 2 weeks is coming the features Workstation and Interactive Calendar which will help traders and investors stay organized.

Right now, the users can visualize in beautiful charts cryptocurrencies from Uniswap and Pancakeswap. The team is currently working on the implementation of Polygon/MATIC blockchain. Next is going to be SOLANA.

All that in combination with the current Market Cap ($1,1M) should give you an idea about the potential of InvestDex and its token INVEST. The competitors are running behind that beast!

SOL,Altcoin,Why I believe 8-Bit Coin will be the biggest GameFi project this year,"I really like GameFi and when I find a really good project like $COIN I just can not help myself and have to find everything about the token.

This coin project was created to level up game development on the Solana network. The goal is to on-board the next wave of web2 gamers into web3

What is interesting about this coin is its connection with Bonk. $COIN has 3 liquidity pools. SOL, USDC and Bonk. The reason for this is very simple. If you dig into all the wallets you will find out that some of the team members are huge Bonk whales with millions in $BONK.

The Dexscreener page might seem weird but this is only because $COIN is still in early stage when team members are setting everything up and preparing their project for this bullrun.

And even though they have not started with marketing yet you can see that the chart looks insane and this project will go to places.

If you want to find out more about this gem, join our Telegram and we will answer any questions you have.

This project was created to level up game development on the Solana network. The goal is to on-board the next wave of web2 gamers into web3

I have always been bullish on GameFi. The potential of on-boarding players all around the world is huge there and 8-Bit Coin can be one of the best performers this bullrun.

$COIN is backed by **BONK whales that made millions** on this coin and now decided to create their own coin.

The interesting thing is that 8-Bit Coin has 3 liquidity pools. **Solana, USDT and previously mentioned BONK**. The connection between these 2 tokens is inevitable there and you can see it even on the official BONK X

This project is still in its early stages so buying now can he a huge opportunity that you do not want to miss. The chart itself looks insane and it will continue the established trend.

As one of our community members said. **“Literally the simplest hold, it's like watching the S&P on steroids.”**

SOL,Altcoin,5 reasons why everyone should hold $COIN,"I would like to present you a project you have probably have not heard about yet. $COIN is a hidden gem that can get us all out of the trenches and if you are reading this post early, $COIN might be your life opportunity because all the marketing is just around the corner.

**But first, what exactly is $COIN?** $COIN is a GameFi project with one simple goal. To level up game development on the Solana blockchain.

**So where is $COIN and what are the next steps?**

* **Big project with still big potential -** $COIN is currently at 20M market cap. This might seem like a lot but after I tell you everything about this project you will change your mind.
* **Content -** $COIN has a really nice and minimalist content. I like it because it is something new and I have never seen concept like this.
* **Team -** This is probably the most bullish thing about $COIN. The people on the team are BONK whales. And when I say whales I mean one of the biggest holders. This means there is a big potential of bringing people from BONK into $COIN.
* **Partnerships -** Because they are BONK whales, they have a lot of money to play with. This means there will be various partnerships, calls, listings and other stuff that will help with exposure and will bring new investors.
* **Chart -** Honestly, how often do you see a chart like this one? As one of our community members said - $COIN is like S&P 500 on steroids.

Overall, this project definitely deserves more noise because all the work they are putting into this. It is extremely rare to find a project with a team like this and so low market cap. I personally will be adding more at these levels because the opportunity waiting there for us is something you do not see often.

SOL,Altcoin,crow with knife meme coin technical analysis from experienced FX trader - 09/08/2024,"[Yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowwithknife/comments/1en0hvu/comment/lh5i96y/?context=3) we discussed how crow with knife was aiming to break the 3rd touch trend line from our peak.

When we looked at the CAWPrice/USD chart instead of the Market cap chart we saw the attempt at the 3rd touch to be much cleaner.

Yesterday price made a strong recovery and a further attempt at the [trend line break](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LmTtWBt7/)

The second attempt failed but is currently sitting at a point where it might make another attempt to break. The pattern below could be forming a bullish flag which would indicate another run higher...price is also curently sitting on a trend line indicating further support. The risk to this is that a bullish flag typically loses strenght when it becomes 1/3rd as long as the flag is high so we may need a catalsty to break the trend line without another pull back and attempt

Not much more to say until price breaks this line...if it fails it will probably move back to the trend retest we spoke about yesterday and if it does break we will see a decent rally before it pulls back to retest this current trend line. Once that line has been re-tested we take off.

DCA, buy dips , be patient...the roof is going to become a floor soon

SOL,Altcoin,Exploring Memecoins Across Blockchains: Discovering Hidden Gems,"Yo, let's talk about memecoins on different blockchains! 🌐

So, I've been checking out a few memecoins lately, and here's the scoop:

On Ethereum, you've got some classics like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. They're like the OGs of the memecoin scene, with huge communities and wild fluctuations.

Then there's Binance Smart Chain (BSC), home to tokens like SafeMoon and Baby Doge. They're all about those crazy reflections and tokenomics.

But you know what's really catching my eye right now? $Powsche on Solana. It's like the underdog of the bunch, but it's got serious potential. The community is super tight-knit, and they're doing some cool stuff with NFTs and charity projects.

Overall, each blockchain has its own vibe when it comes to memecoins. Ethereum for the big names, BSC for the reflections, and Solana for that hidden gem like $Powsche. Definitely worth keeping an eye on! 🚀

CMC :https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/powsche/#:\~:text=The%20live%20Powsche%20price%20today,USD%20price%20in%20real%2Dtime.",12,2024-04-27 18:18:13,12
SOL,Altcoin,crow with knife meme coin technical analysis from experienced FX trader - 08/08/2024,"[Yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowwithknife/comments/1em5xjk/crow_with_knife_meme_coin_technical_analysis_from/) we spoke about the recovery of CAW to the purple box that's been discussed since the [26th](https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1ecix4j/comment/lf58w8l/?context=3).

I suggested it would fail to trigger the box and then price would fall back to the high 30s before it headed higher on thurs/or friday. Price got so close to the box though ...that I have been debating calling it a hit.

Why this matters is that if then 3rd touch of the big trend line running from the peak is triggered on it's 3rd touch it will be FAR easier to break.

https://preview.redd.it/3dnojbhddehd1.png?width=1428&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6935af31ff81c2c11ecad79a14fc046615d7d39

Now I typically chart in market share view on DEX screener v USD however you can also chart on price view also versus CRO. This gives us 4 slightly different charts. By slighty different I mean price will be 2-3% off. If we were to look at price v usd chart we do actually trigger the box

https://preview.redd.it/36wwlk8deehd1.png?width=1700&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf719148a8c62363d479f529db3c4b08a50ad403

Price then pulled back to the trend line retest of the 6 week down trend line shown and the 38 fib of the latest move up as shown [here .](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ii3Bu7FR/)

https://preview.redd.it/i48j4pj4jehd1.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cee55ada7ee0d3288547ad2280fa9561174876

This means that despite a significant pull back later in the day the price action is pretty bullish and pretty soon ill be able to start discussing our next price targets in more detail

There is however still some downside risk as BTC looks like it's struggling to find bullish direction.

**Proposed strategy**

DCA, buy dips , be patient

I believe there’s plenty of $$$ to made for all those who get in soon.  This is NOT some sort of fickle memecoin that will pump and dump.

$DOG is here to stay. It is the No1 memecoin on the No1 blockchain!!!! It’s that simple.

$DOG was also realised fairly and there were no BS team/VC allocations. AND 100% of the tokens are in circulation so NO UNLOCKS .

I really believe this is a no brainer. Each L1 has a leading memecoin but BITCOIN until now hasn’t.

SOL,Altcoin,Community is the most important factor in memecoins,"This is my second bull run and I decided to try out trading Solana memecoins this time around. I have gone through dev rugs, based devs and the most idiotic devs but through all this, one thing and the main thing that makes a coin go up or down is community. The people actually buying into the coin. 

I have most of my bag in Powsche for exactly this reason. Community. Obviously I still trade with different tokens and coins on the side but I always go back to Powsche because no matter what happens the community always prevails and it has gotten to a point where I do not even check the price anymore because I trust in the community and dev that we will bring the coin up when the time comes.

If you do still do not believe me, why are there successful CTOs? Why is there a CTO meta? Bring it back to what a CTO is, Community Takeover, read the first word again.

SOL,Altcoin,Pitquidity: Passive income King returning 50% of profits to holders from Node/LP/Staking and more,"   
Make Passive Income so you won't have to grovel to a boss again. It is just one component to being financially free, and is what [Pitquidity.io](https://pitquidity.io/) offers. We have been live for a few months now and are now letting the world know what we have built behind the scenes in our new marketing phase starting now!

Most cryptos are projects where investors put their money into a coin and hope the price goes up. That is the sole dimension most investors look at. We have built [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) to be the best passive income crypto on the market today with our exclusive assets. [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) has project tokens on both ETH and BSC chains that are low tax reflection tokens that reward you in either ETH or BNB for holding $PITQD. All [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) tokens have or will have a very low tax as we encourage volume, and having PITQD as a trading token is another aspect to it's functionality.

Here is the best part!! [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) runs various nodes and manages various staking pools amongst other passive income activities and shares 50% of the weekly profits with token holders each weekend. With the other half of the profits, [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) takes and reinvests into node/staking to grow the asset base. Some of the hallmark assets owned are 5 Gala nodes, 15 instance Energi node, Almost 20k Songbird delegation tokens, Mysterium network and Presearch node operations plus more on ETH, BSC, Solana, Songbird and Polygon networks. All positions can be viewed and tracked on the [Pitquidity Financial Page](https://www.pitquidity.io/financials).

The freeing part is once your position is large enough in PITQD, the ETH and BNB it generates for you will allow you to break free from centralized exchanges like Coinbase to buy ETH or another exchange to buy BNB, as they are deposited in your wallet automatically.

There is also another side of the project called [Hardwood](https://www.pitquidity.io/hardwood) that is a trading floor with various trading tokens that will never be rug pulled.

Some of the tokens reflect back XRP, ADA USD and [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) is adding more tokens regularly. [Hardwood](https://www.pitquidity.io/hardwood)

There is a lot more to the project, and this is just a general overview. but follow the twitter, FB, Reddit etc., and get in the Telegram group for more info on how it works. They all can be found at the bottom of the homepage here: [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/)

More importantly, Divi will in the coming months announce the launch  of its cross-chain bridge between Divi to Binance smart chain and  Ethereum developed by Divi Labs. The launch will mark a key milestone  toward making cryptocurrencies simple and frictionless to use, helping  to make digital assets more accessible to everyday users.

This launch is a remarkable debut for Divi, as we expect significant  development in the project’s ecosystem, specifically regarding the  coin’s price. Research and statistics gathered are pointers to the  bullish effect this launch may have on the value of Divi’s coin. Moreso,  the bridge will be integrated into the easy-to-use Divi wallet, which  already supports ETH, BTC, and LTC. No large-scale announcement has been  made yet, so these expectations are not yet baked into the price of  Divi. 

As much as Divi’s cross-chain bridge is exciting, it is not the first  of its kind. There are existing cross-chain bridges such as the wrap  protocol of Tezos, Panama of Binance, Wormhole of Solana, and lots more.  Some of these chain bridges have been launched as far back as 2020 and  have been operational since then. Thorough investigations have been made  regarding the playouts of these existing cross-chain bridges, with  lookouts on the price and volume relative to the dates and periods. The  table below is a table analysis of five different samples of on-chain  bridges.

SOL,Altcoin,Why is $CATHEON is going to make me a millionaire? (DD included DYOR),"After seeing this token pop up on my Twitter multiple times over the last few days I wanted to share this buy-of-the-century opportunity in the blockchain gaming space. SolChicks (first high quality game on Solana) has just announced a rebrand of their single game token to a gaming ecosystem token across 25 games + Steam platform + metaverse project called Catheon Gaming.

The business model is similar to other gaming ecosystems such as Gala, WEMIX and Immutable X with a portfolio of high quality games, and a high degree of vertical integration (ranging from game development to distribution and SDK). Compared to its competitors Catheon is more focused on a publisher / advisory model to convert successful Web2 games to Web3, and has the highest number of quality games among its peers.

While similar gaming ecosystem tokens all trade around \~$1.5 billion fully diluted market capitalization, **SolChicks token (**[**https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solchicks-token/markets/**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solchicks-token/markets/)**) is only $45M now (only \~3% of the price of the competitors), due to temporary mispricing as a single game token, but will be swapped 1 for 1 for Catheon token if it is bought before their snapshot at 1PM UTC on 13 Oct 2022.** With the largest game portfolio and one of the biggest communities (in terms of Twitter following and existing token holders), there’s no way the Catheon token is valued lower than its peers. Already up \~300% in the last few days. You can check out the details yourself on their website, what do you think?

SOL,Altcoin,Copying the investment strategies of top performing crypto VCs Discover what coins top crypto investors are buying,"

**About your author: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast to our weekly Staking and Farming Review. Visit us at www.cryptoquestion.tech** 

&#x200B;

They say imitation is the ultimate form of flattery. It is also a good way to make money.

Most of the top investors publish their investment portfolios. From Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway to some of the top ranked crypto funds.

The only problem is, most of us choose to ignore this valuable information mostly to our own detriment.

The stocks and coins which venture capital firms invest in are generally publicly available. The problem is most of us don’t have the time and or inclination to go searching. Today we are handing this invaluable information to you on a silver encrusted plater.

**Replicating the returns of leading VCs**

It makes sense that if you invest in the same crypto projects as the best performing crypto investors then you should enjoy similar returns.

It can also be an effective way to avoid the dark side of crypto. Hunting amongst the small and micro caps for that elusive moonshot is a dangerous and ultra high risk activity littered with fraud, bad actors and incompetent operators.

**Caveats**

There are a few caveats however. First, remember past performance is no reflection of the future. Just because a VC holds Axie Infinity for example doesn’t mean you are going to enjoy the same level of returns particularly as many well connected VCs jumped in at the beginning. It’s all about timing. 

Secondly many VCs hold a portfolio of investments, this may be difficult to replicate if your resources are limited. 

Finally, just because a fund has performed well in the past doesn’t guarantee future out performance. You don’t need to look very far to see examples of this. Take Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF. It surged more than 152% in 2020, beating the Nasdaq's 43.6% return. But the ARKK ETF sharply underperformed the Nasdaq in 2021 finishing down 24% compared to the Nasdaq's 21.4% advance. That underperformance continued into 2022 with the ARKK ETF down 28.6% through March 3.

**How it works**

Saying all that, replicating the most successful crypto VCs investment strategies is still a powerful tool.

We selected the top performing crypto VCs in the industry. VCs such as Hashed who turned $700,000 into $4 billion in 5 years, Draper Associates, run by the influential Tim Draper an early investor in Hotmail, Skype, Tesla and Bitcoin and MultiCoin Capital, who boasts one of the best performances in history.

We analyzed the top performing VC portfolios and from them selected only their token and coin investments which are tradable on public exchanges. Some of the investments made by these VCs are into blockchain related startup corporations meaning there is no way for the investing public to participate. However we did come across some very exciting investments. A few of these are well known to the crypto community and won’t come as a surprise, but there were many others. 

Space and attention constrained we did have to perform a level of selection as many VCs had extensive portfolios. We would suggest taking a deeper dive into a few of these to check out what we missed.

We have begun by summarizing some of the most common tokens/coins held by the top crypto VCs. We then provided a snapshot of the portfolios for each VC we examined. 

**Conduct your own due diligence**

We recommend you conduct your own due diligence before investing. Don’t just invest blindly but know that these are quality projects/investments backed by the best in the industry. VCs are canny operators, by following their portfolios you should be able to identify promising sectors early and understand how VCs see the crypto world developing. This should help you with your own investment decisions whether or not you invest in the same projects these VCs are invested in.

Another handy technique is to follow these VCs and see what the latest coins/tokens they have invested in. There will undoubtedly be some price action on the back of their investment but this usually drops back after a short time and is a great source of investment ideas.

**Spreading your risk**

We would suggest investing in a small portfolio of these investments which you can add to your existing crypto portfolio subject to only investing risk capital.

Remember this is crypto. VCs have a high risk tolerance. Many of these investments may well be worth billions of dollars but they are still high risk.

SOL,Altcoin,Decentralization of dapps on blockchain,"This is a story where I am one of the early users of the Aptos Names Service (ANS) project. My article is not intended to encourage bashing the project or any requests for the project. THIS IS JUST AN ARTICLE AS THE TITLE SUGGESTS, ABOUT DECENTRALIZATION. The story goes like this:

If you are a recent participant in the crypto market, specifically in early 2022, you may know about Layer1 projects, Defi projects, and recent trends, then you may know about Aptos - a Layer1 blockchain project that operates using the Move language, with the goal of being a Solana Killer & ETH Killer(Here's the project if you don't know [APTOS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aptos/))

On October 19, 2022, Aptos mainnet launched and caused a huge buzz on social media at that time due to the backing of the Diem team and a massive airdrop for users. Like previous testers, I also received this gift and decided to invest it in a native dapp managed and launched by the Aptos development team called the Aptos Name Service. At that time, to mint a 3-character domain of ANS, you needed 80 APT, 4 characters required 40 APT, and 5 characters required 20 APT. At that time, I wondered why the ecosystem's domain was so expensive, but then I trusted the project and bought one domain. Everything would be completely normal like other domain projects until early 2023, when I wanted to renew my domain. After a search, I found that my domain could not be renewed. I went to Discord, asked, and received an answer from the project that there was currently no renewal function and would be added in the future:)). At this point, I had doubts about the project but still ignored them and continued to use it. But it seems that all my guesses and doubts are gradually becoming true.

&#x200B;

On March 8, 2023, which was yesterday, ANS announced on its Twitter that they want to increase the number of users, so they will reduce the fee for minting ANS domain names, with 3 characters being 20 APT, 4 characters being 10 APT, and 5 characters being 5 APT, which is divided by 4. This is also within my speculation because a domain that costs up to 80 APT is quite expensive and needs to be reduced. But what made me extremely disappointed is the second announcement of the project, that the domains created or purchased on the secondary market since January 1, 2023, will be compensated for one year:)). By this point, you probably understand my point somewhat, since January 1, 2023, so what about those who created in October, November, December?

&#x200B;

I and many early users, who created domains before 2023, asked in Discord, and the project team said that compensation would not be given to those who created domains before that. Later, they sent me a bunch of documents about the TERMS OF USE that they had prepared from February 2023 (i.e., 5 months after early users created domain names). Yes, a VALID set of documents was released after we, the early users who created domains 5 months ago, were required to comply with it (I can confirm to you that I and other early users have not seen this before, and we have not used our wallets to sign it).

&#x200B;

Now, I want to ask the project the following questions:

&#x200B;

1.Why weren't these changes announced or mentioned in the Roadmap for the community to know, but were automatically notified and changed (if the project can automatically change the price 4 times, then it is entirely possible for them to decrease it to 0.1 APT)?

2.Why did you let early users create such high-priced domain names? If you want more users and better service, why not make the domain creation fee 20 APT from the beginning?

3.Why do early users who created domain names in 2022 not receive any compensation and not even get their domain names extended?

4. You reduced the domain name price by 4 times, why only compensate for 1 year :))

&#x200B;

A blockchain project community always emphasizes decentralization and equality. However, projects are becoming more centralized, and users are losing their rights.\* => My guess and that of early users is that they intentionally did not allow early users to renew or compensate for their beautiful domain names. I wouldn't be surprised if in the future, they require domain owners in 2022 to pay 200 APT to maintain them :)). But it must be said that a project with a professional team working like this makes me very disappointed.

&#x200B;

I HOPE MY ARTICLE AND MANY PEOPLE WILL HELP YOU AVOID SIMILAR PROJECTS.

SOL,Altcoin,I’m thinking about going hard into KADENA. I’m interested in your perspectives,"There’s 5 or 6 coins that make up about 50-60% of my alt coin portfolio. (About 10% each) Solana, ELROND, KADENA, etc.

The rest are coins I’m interested in but less committed to, and I hold about 5% of each. 

I’m thinking about increasing the percentage of KDA drastically, maybe to 25%. 

From what I have learned about it, it’s $2.5-3 billion dollar market cap is way small. It seems to have the right combination of having plenty room to grow and the momentum to do the same.

What are your thoughts on the project? Is 10% enough? Too much?

Is this a project like Solana that has nothing holding it back or is the “we solved the trifecta” claim a bit of hype?

The market took a hit this week dropping by nearly 13%, 5% of that fall happening in the last 24 hours. However by the time you read this there will no doubt have been another notable market movement. And that is why our general rule is to focus on the micro not the macro. Focus on what you can control - or at least have some element of control over!

Our list saw every one of our selected cryptocurrencies apart from three in negative territory with most seeing at least 20% wiped off their market value. It was not a pretty site!

**The week’s winners were:**

Lunch Money +38%

Faceter +13%

DAPS +7%

**And the biggest losers:**

Rarible -35%

Bridge Mutual -33%

Hybrix -29%

Handshake - 27%

We didn’t add any tokens this week although we have at least one lined up for you next week due diligence depending.

We removed two projects this week, Alpaca and Polkerstarter. We believe Alpaca doesn't offer anything different to the many operators in this market. We are also nervous about the SEC and state regulators targeting this space. For the same reason we have removed Polkerstarter. It is only a matter of time before the SEC targets the launchpad model and Polkerstarter will be at the top of their list.

SOL,Altcoin,MetisDAO - Premier Layer 2 launching its mainnet this month - In-Depth DD Analysis Thread $METIS," EXTENDED DD POST ON METISDAO, THIS WILL BE A LONG, DETAILED THREAD:

As most people are aware, the gas fee crisis that has hit Ethereum this summer has plagued its many users. Without the availability of a viable L2 solution, it will remain an ongoing problem until ETH 2.0 is built, tested and functional (which may not be until mid 2022 or even into 2023). It is worth noting however that the release of ETH 2.0 will not signal the end of L2's as even Vitalik, Co founder of Ethereum has recently stated in an interview that when ETH 2.0 is eventually released, L2’s will still be required for Ethereum to realise its full potential and functionality.

While Optimistic Ethereum and Arbitrum’s Arbitrum One gather the most headlines and excitement as they gear up for public launch, they are just two of several rollup solutions nearing completion.

Metis is one of these solutions. It is a fork of Optimism that aims to improve upon its currently more popular competitors. Metis seeks to offer the standard benefits of optimistic rollups like low fees (<$1), speed (less than one second), and Ethereum-level economic security. But it plans to differentiate its platform by providing native data storage, faster withdrawals to the Ethereum layer 1 main chain, and improved usability for DApp providers.

This is a true hidden gem (and I do mean hidden, as marketing has been rather quiet considering its potential) that has enormous potential to also experience a parabolic price movement like Matic had earlier this year.

If Metis had Matic’s market cap, it would be over $9000 per token!! Metis will no doubt be in the hundreds and most likely thousands in the short and mid term, which is why at a 80m market cap it is such a gem!

**If Metis has the market cap of other competing L2s:** 

**LoopRing -- price would be $866**

**OMG -- price would be $1535**

**Celer -- price would be $498**

**For the rest of the comparisons you can do it yourself at** [**https://www.marketcapof.com/metis-token/matic-network**](https://www.marketcapof.com/metis-token/matic-network)

Also, it currently is only available to purchase from a CEX on Gate.io, but will be launching on multiple exchanges, confirmed by the team, around launch time. This is an optimal time to get in, either on Uniswap or other DEXs. While it is starting to get noticed by CrypoTwitter, notably the following influencers:

\-  ElonTrades                - Carl from the Moon

 \- RonBubble           - BlockChain Whispers

 \- CMTopDog                     - TerraNova

   \- Murfski                            - Scott Melker

\- Ash                                 - Suppoman

Now is the ideal time before EVERYONE apes in and before centralized exchange listings, which is imminent.

**=================**

**$METIS** \- Metis.io

Launched May 13

1 M Hackathon: October 2nd - November 30

Mainnet Launch: Early November

**=================**

**TL;DR: This project will be a a key part of Ethereum’s future and Web 3.0, I expect it will 3x in the short term, and 5x-10x by End of Year. That would be $180+ short term, and $300-$600 by EOY.** 

**If Metis had just ¼ the market cap of Matic, price would be $2250.** 

**Key differences between Metis and other L2 solutions are withdrawal times of hours compared to days, transaction speed, Polis middleware, and DACs, and it having its own native token when compared to Optimism and Arbitrum.**

**Check out the Messari report here:**[ https://messari.io/article/optimistic-about-metis](https://messari.io/article/optimistic-about-metis)

This is an impartial report that goes in detail on what Metis is, what they are trying to do, and an overview of their unique tech compared to other L2’s.

**CONTINUE READING FOR AN IN-DEPTH (LONG) DUE DILIGENCE LOOK AT METIS BELOW:**

What is **Metis**, what are they doing, and why should you care?

**In one line** – The overall infrastructure that Metis is building: Layer2+Polis Middleware+DAC, is for the collaborations in the web3 world. 

**In two lines** \- It’s doing much more than a Layer 2, with faster withdrawal times and additional features, and has the potential to be THE premier L2 on Ethereum, and compared to other Optimistic Rollups, has a token with a very limited supply.

**In three lines –** The entire goal Metis is to build a whole web3 infrastructure. So, Layer 2 scaling to get them cheap and fast transactions, builder mining program which will allow builders on the Metis network to generate a stack of $METIS tokens from the transactions they made, then DACs to run an entire company ON CHAIN, with Polis Middleware which allows ANYONE to create a DAC with no coding templates!

**Tokenomics** (taken from the whitepaper):

* Total supply 4,930,000 tokens
* Current supply 1,260,399 tokens
* Token unlocks are on the 13th of every month
* Team has pushed back the larger token unlock on November 13th back 3 months

**As of 11/1**

· Market Cap: 79,342,941

· Price: $62.41  

**Team**

All doxxed, experienced team with DEEP connections in the industry. The Metis story is an evolution of CryptoChicks, which was founded by Elena Sinelnikova & Natalia Ameline. Crypto Chicks is one of the largest blockchain advocacy and education non-profits in the world, with a presence in 56 different countries.

The growth of CryptoChicks led Elena and Natalia to form a large ecosystem of smart blockchain people, and ultimately a ""hatchery"" to launch new blockchain projects. It was there that Elena met Yuan Su. Yuan is an absolute genius. He started coding at age 6. He has an incredible analytical mind and massive ambitions. Yet he's a genuinely great dude, very hip to everything happening in the blockchain and crypto worlds. When he met Elena he was one of the lead devs for IBM's Hyperledger project. Then there was Kevin Liu. Kevin understands product development and team building better than anyone I've ever met. He's a serial founder who to that point hadn't found the perfect project.

Together the 3 of them co-founded Metis, with the EXACT same goal of CryptoChicks: to make blockchain easy and accessible to EVERYONE, from curious coffee-shop ladies to your grandpa.

In addition to the outstanding dev team, marketing team, founders, and partnerships, a big strength of the Metis team would not be complete without mentioning Natalia Ameline. Natalia is the co-founder of CryptoChicks with Elena Sinelnikova, and a lead technical advisor for Metis. She is listed on the Metis website and has appeared at conferences with Metis. 

Natalia is the mother of Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum.  This is not widely advertised by the team or even in the community, as the main focus is on the technology behind Metis, its partnerships, and its development. You can connect the dots as to the value of having such a high profile and well connected team, especially after launch, but now the focus is on what the Metis team has accomplished and will continue to accomplish.

**Community**

The Metis community is really amazing, one of the most experienced and mature Telegram groups in crypto. Because of its strong fundamentals and long term approach, it has attracted more experienced members, those with deeper pockets and a fundamental understanding of DeFi and the overall crypto ecosystem. This is not a pump & dump or young/dumb, wen moon community. Developers are active in the main chat and discord, and there is regular interaction with some of the bigger influencers that have spread the word about this gem to their community, as well as made videos about Metis.

Here are some great introductory videos:

CMTopDog Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRYtM-489Ss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRYtM-489Ss)

Suppoman’s Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF8qaXTkpeA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF8qaXTkpeA)

By far the best part of the community is the Metis Team. Their communication is unmatched, both with technical questions, onboarding new members with answers to basic questions, getting feedback from the community, and providing updates on development. Jonah leads the marketing and business development teams, and is very active in Telegram both publicly and privately. One of Metis’ biggest strengths outside of its fundamentals and tech, is Jonah and his team, and they continue to shine and inspire confidence. Head on over to their TG channels here:

**Audits**

Metis is being TRIPLE-audited ahead of our Andromeda Layer 2 network launch, part of their commitment to ABSOLUTE adherence to the highest security standards before any network release. They have partnered with Armors Security, one of the largest blockchain security and auditing companies in the world, and have already completed two successful audits with . 

**Marketing**

$1 MILLION Metis Hackathon, lasting two months, that has thus far attracted hundreds of developers; Their core Hackathon marketing team meets every day to plan strategies, attract more developers, and attract more partners. When the event is over, hundreds of new DApps will be deployed on Metis. If you compare this to Matic’s development, who had a 60

Heavy engagement across all social media, especially Twitter, Telegram, and Discord.

Sponsorship of ETHOnline to reach out to the Ethereum developer community.

Outreach to numerous Ethereum developer groups on Discord and Telegram.

They are about to launch ad campaigns on Twitter and Facebook, centered around Hackathon.

They have a guerrilla marketing agency publishing articles for us constantly about the Hackathon, in both mainstream crypto publications and more developer-focused ones.

That agency is also constantly pumping up engagement for Metis progress on Reddit, 4Chan, and other channels.

Metis has dozens of early investors who we reach out to all the time to push and promote their progress. Some of them do so in very visible places like social media. Others do so within private whale groups, VC and investor communities.

A lot of the marketing efforts are geared toward China, which has been the largest and supportive market from day one. If you speak Mandarin and/or live in China, you can see the volume of those marketing efforts.

They’ve conducted community promotions of all kinds, from airdrops in the early days to constant AMAs in other communities to the current $1000 network naming contest.

Between Labor Day and November Meits is attending about 7-8 major conferences all over the world. This week, core team members were in Lisbon for two of the industry’s largest conferences. In the coming weeks they’ll be in NYC, Russia, and lots of other major locales for huge conferences, and they have got the Best Startup Award at BILife\_Forum conference.

In the past two weeks they’ve made multiple hires, tripling the size of their marketing team. Their new hires come with tons of experience in both the blockchain and traditional business worlds. They have vast experience when it comes to everything from traditional marketing metrics such as KPIs to creative community approaches and influencer campaigns. They’re also spread out all over the world, such that the company effectively runs on a 24/7 schedule, with much of their core team in Canada, and then stretching all the way across the globe to Ukraine, India, China, Australia, and beyond.

Round-the-clock business development efforts and outreach. The best marketing in blockchain is to build the most robust ecosystem possible. Metis is meeting with Web2 and Web3 projects of all sizes and types. On average the team is taking about 5 BizDev video calls per day with new prospects.

Metis talk to top-tier exchanges all the time. Blockchain/crypto is all about leverage. As a project grows and gains adoption, the biggest exchanges go from being reluctant to even talk to you to asking for half a million bucks (or more) to list, to eager to list you for free for fear of missing out. They’ve seen this shift occur in real time, as the quality of their exchange conversations has grown a lot in the past six months. Obviously once they’re listed on the largest exchanges, awareness and interest in the project (and token) will skyrocket.

The upcoming staking program is a major, major marketing tool. Pumping starting APYs of 29000% has (and will continue to) attract lots of attention.

One important thing to note, is that Metis is the only one of these solutions that has its own native token!

**Final thoughts**  
**Metis’ Layer 2 solution and the resulting fast and cheap transactions are merely the way in. The key differentiators are:**   
**1) Withdrawal time (compared to Arbitrum)** Hours vs. Days! With ambitions to go on in minutes.  
**2) IPFS data storage:** enabling cheap on-chain storage of massive amounts of data, such as NFTs (neither Ethereum Layer 1 nor ANY other scaling solution does this)  
 **3) Polis Middleware**: enabling BOTH blockchain projects and NON-blockchain projects to integrate onto our Layer 2 with ZERO coding experience required (we ALWAYS emphasize that our entire raison d'etre is to make integrating onto blockchain fast and easy)   
**4) Builder Mining,** i.e. EVERY time a DApp performs a transaction on our Layer 2, that DApp generates token rewards, this is a KILLER feature that our rivals don't offer   
**5) DACs:** The entire goal of the company is to build a whole web3 infrastructure. So, Layer 2 scaling to get them cheap and fast transactions, builder mining to generate a stack of $METIS tokens, then DACs to run your entire company ON CHAIN with all the payroll, accounting, messaging, and other features seen in ""real life companies"", with the added advantage of staking and mining real $METIS tokens to both grow their stack and to have more tokens for utility purposes to run their company on chain. Also there will be templates for the DAC, meaning you will be able to pick the template toc company/community etc…, and on top of that you will be able to modify them to suit your needs.  (More info about DACs here: [https://metisdao.medium.com/what-is-metis-what-the-heck-are-dacs-whats-the-deal-with-staking-ba25f2c274ca](https://metisdao.medium.com/what-is-metis-what-the-heck-are-dacs-whats-the-deal-with-staking-ba25f2c274ca) )

**6) Netswap**: Layer 2 DEX with swap/trade functions, with other functions on top like staking, and **Launchpad** which will enable Metis holders to participate in special IDO and pre-IDO which was available only for whales before.

**DISCLAIMER**

Although I believe there is very little chance of losing money long-term when investing in $METIS at the sort of prices before it gets listed on multiple exchanges, you should remember there are no guarantees in the crypto market and you should never invest money that you can’t afford to lose. Other than this - DYOR, verify all details yourself and make your own calculated decisions. A good place to start is to directly approach the team on their official channels.

**Market Overview**

September has been a pretty negative month with the overall market seeing its value decline by 7%. The fear and greed index slipped back into extreme fear and now sits at fear. However there are reasons to be positive. Firstly the Chairman of the Fed, Jerome Powell, told congress he did not intend to ban crypto currency, although he said stablecoins needed greater regulatory oversight. Secondly, the massive recent negativity surrounding China’s ban on crypto looks to have been overdone as usual. It is evident that the Chinese crypto enthusiast has no intention of letting the crypto revolution pass him by. It appears as though they have started trading through DEX’s as witnessed by the surge in trade on Dydx. Finally the Chair of the SEC said that he supported a bitcoin ETF, another positive step forward for the industry. So all in all a positive week.

**Trending**

**Regulators target DeFi**

The SEC is investigating Uniswap Labs, the organization behind the leading DEX Uniswap. It is early days yet but is a sign of things to come. That news was followed by the announcement that New Jersey had served a cease and desist order on Celsius, a leading yield farming platform which advertises, ‘earn 17% yield on your crypto’. Alabama and Texas are also looking at doing the same. Both Celsius and Uniswap rolled out the same statement that they are willing to work with regulators. Finally, Coinbase was told in no uncertain terms that if they continued with their plans to launch a lending platform the SEC would sue. Whilst Coinbase continued to deny that lending represented a regulated activity, they had no choice but to shelve or bin their proposals.

Check out our [Staking and Yield Farming Review](https://medium.com/the-capital/weekly-staking-and-yield-farming-review-23rd-september-2021-6904585050c4) which sets out our thinking on these regulatory actions and what strategy investors should follow.

**The UK’s Post Office enters crypto**

Yes you heard it right! The Post Office announced that its app can be used to connect to a decentralized exchange called Swarm Markets, from there vouchers can be purchased that are redeemable for crypto. British politicians were up in arms about the announcement. The fully diluted market cap of Swarm is a modest $70 million, could be worth a closer look assuming the unhappy politicians don’t get their way.

**That old chestnut - China**

The recent stumble in the crypto market was blamed on China’s now outright ban of crypto no doubt to protect it’s digital yuan which it is rolling out. This should be no surprise. China has been tough on crypto for some time, the only surprise is this didn't happen sooner. Crypto will do just fine without China.

**Binance again**

Every month there is never any shortage of negative stories to write about when it comes to Binance’s trials and tribulations. This month saw the announcement that both the IRS and the DOJ are investigating. It is reported that this is for market manipulation and insider trading. Binance also announced it was withdrawing from yet another market, Singapore. We do hope that investors who use Binance’s central wallet have started to move their crypto into their own wallet.

**Robinhood and PayPal**

Robinhood announced that they were rolling out a crypto wallet with transfer features allowing customers to store crypto and move in and out of their apps. The market considers Robinhood a serious threat to Coinbase’s business with this move. Meanwhile back in the grey and damp UK PayPal announced they were introducing crypto trading services through their PayPal accounts. Of course there is a limited selection of coins available including the Bitcoin fork Bitcoin Cash valued at a ridiculous $10 billion.

**Cardano introducing its own stablecoin**

September saw the launch of the much anticipated and long overdue smart contract functionality on the Cardano blockchain. Named the Djed, it is an algorithmic stablecoin as compared to one backed by fiat. Its new stable coin is expected to make transaction costs on the Cardano network cheaper and more predictable. Its announcement comes at a time when US regulators are considering regulating or banning stablecoins.

**Finally…**

There is talk that the SEC is investigating Tether, the leading stablecoin player. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone following the shenanigans at Tether over their total lack of transparency since inception. There have been multiple reports of investigations into breaching banking and security laws.

**Inside Track podcasts**

We continue to build our library of interesting content from emerging projects and technologies in the blockchain space. Inside Track is the best way to learn about cryptocurrency from experts in the field as well as discover emerging projects from NFTs to DeFi, from memecoins to launchpads.

**Staking and Yield Farming**

Each week we provide the latest APRs from leading staking and yield farming platforms together with news from the industry.

Staking and yield farming has been a major driver in the huge growth in the DeFi sector. Investors are being enticed by the massive APRs on offer. Totally new projects tempting investors with returns of 10,000+ % are able to attract a deluge of money from investors who don’t seem concerned with the high risks involved. Our weekly review looks at the best platforms out there and the ones to avoid. We attempt to weed out the platforms that we think won’t stand the test of time.

SOL,Altcoin,This Week’s Micro Cap Watch List - Latest Moonshots and Altcoin Resources,"&#x200B;

**About your author:** **CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from our weekly** [**Moonshot Monday**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/weekly-podcast/) **podcast to our weekly Staking and Farming Review. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

The last few weeks have seen us devoting a disproportionate amount of time researching undervalued and undiscovered micro caps. Last week we revealed seven micro caps with market values under $2m, you can read the article here. This week we have been hunting for gems with market caps under $1m. It’s been an eye opening experience to say the least. Whilst there are few gems in this micro cap space they are there and as we all know, if you get it right it can be very lucrative. That is what gives us inspiration!

So with that said let’s look at how our current list has performed.

There appeared to be a bout of profit taking this week with a handful of projects which have enjoyed strong price runs over the last few weeks taking a hit. Other than that the list held its ground with only one significant performer.

**The main winners were:**

Faceter +46%

Handshake +11%

**And the losers:**

Candela -65%

Rentible -36%

PlotX -28%

We added only one project to our list this week.

**Lunch Money (LMY) -** [**https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lunch-money**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lunch-money)

Lunch Money describes itself as a universal loyalty rewards program, created by Restaurant Private I Inc, a mystery shopper platform aimed at improving customer service through anonymous customer oversights and incentives. Restaurant customers and restaurant delivery service customers can simply earn Lunch Money (LMY) by providing real feedback on their service experience.

Lunch Money has been around now for a few years with the token price having fallen from a high of $0.26 to its current price of $0.003, that’s a 99% reduction. But the project is far from dead. The team have been quietly beavering away building a new platform and establishing partnerships. Amazingly it is one of the few crypto projects registered with the US’s Securities Exchange Commission.

This is the kind of project that could go viral very easily. Why wouldn’t you provide a restaurant review if you are being paid to do so? This project is all about getting traction. It is in exactly the right spot, the gig economy. With a fully diluted market cap of $500,000 this project is a long shot but could well end up being a gem hidden under a mound of pebbles. It has no real volume at the moment and can rightly be described as undiscovered. That can work both ways.

You can buy Lunch Money through Uniswap.

Lunch Money replaces last week’s addition of Libertas. We will tell you the full story of our fall out with the CEO at Libertas in Monday’s Moonshot Monday. This made us question their own credibility hence their banishment from our list.

If you are interested at all in the world outside micro caps you can read our latest article [Solana vs Cardano ](https://cryptoquestion.tech/report-solana-vs-cardano/)where we provide an assessment of each project together with a price target. The article caused quite a stir from a few of the die hard Cardano fans. We like causing stirs!

SOL,Altcoin,The CryptoQuestion November Bulletin - Important news roundup and free crypto resources for your listening and viewing pleasure,"**About us: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

**Market Overview**

The crypto market continues its new bull run, which re-commenced in July, hitting a new high of $2.7 trillion. Both Bitcoin and Ether also reached all time highs in October. Binance Coin, Tether and Cardano make up the top five by market cap. The Fear and Greed index currently sits at ‘Greed’, which compares to last week’s ‘Extreme Greed’ and last month’s neutral.

**Trending**

**SEC Approves Bitcoin Futures ETF**

After years of false starts the crypto industry finally got its ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). The SEC approved the ProShare Bitcoin Strategy ETF. After two days on the NYSE ProShare’s ETF became the fastest fund ever to reach $1 billion in assets under management. Physically based bitcoin ETFs, where you invest directly in bitcoin, are still waiting approval, but it is a promising start.

**SEC Chairman claims U.S won’t ban crypto**

It came as a relief to the market when Gensler the Chairman of the SEC declared that the U.S would not ban crypto but would seek to better regulate it. Although the final decision would be up to Congress. That regulation is most likely to be focused on the stablecoin market to begin with.

**Walmart enters crypto**

Walmart shoppers can now buy bitcoin at 200 kiosks in its stores. The test is with Coinstar which offers bitcoin at more than 3,000 kiosks.

**Axie Infinity creator raises $152 million**

Axie Infinity is one of the most popular play-ro-earn games on the blockchain commanding a $38 billion valuation (fully diluted). An Investment in the creator rather than the tokens is a telling sign that the tokens do not represent good value. Avoid for now.

**Memecoin mania**

Shiba Inu, the memcoin named after another dog, saw its token rocket in value before falling back after a comment from Musk that he didn't own any. But that comment didn't stop its rise and it is now valued above Dogecoin at $38 billion. Of course that has reignited the search for the next Doge or Shiba, a search we won't be embarking on.

**Squid Games pump and dump**

A token inspired by the Netflix show Squid Games saw its price spiral upwards by 380,000% on its debut. That upwards momentum continued as the price hit $2,861. However the price came crashing down as the founders cashed out with a $12 million profit and left the ‘project’. That my friends is the danger of investing in memecoins and projects with no fundamentals.

**NFT mania**

Coinbase announced it was launching an NFT marketplace focusing initially on Ethereum based NFTs.

**The good and bad of Robinhood**

Robinhood’s announcement that it was launching a crypto wallet hit the share price of Coinbase particularly after they revealed they had already signed up 1 million people to the upcoming product. However Robinhood suffered its own set back a few days later when it reported its quarterly earnings. The main cause of concern was the fall off in crypto trading from $233 million in the previous quarter to $51 million in the current. The shares tanked.

**USDC finds itself under investigation**

One of the leading stable coins, number two behind Tether, was issued with a subpoena from the SEC back in July, only recently coming to light however. It was also disclosed that the investigation continues. USDC announced it was shifting its reserves to only cash and treasuries. It is expected that the SEC will oversee the stablecoin market in the short term, something which will no doubt send shivers up the spine of Tether.

**Tether’s house of cards**

Last month we reported that the SEC is investigating Tether. This month they were hit with a $42.5 million fine by the CFTC. It was also reported in a Bloomberg expose that billions of dollars of client money has been invested in risky crypto projects, something the team at Tether initially denied but was later confirmed by Celsius who benefited from an investment of $1 billion. This is a devastating revelation and is a sure sign that if there was ever a bank run investors would suffer massive losses.

**New York targets DeFi Lending**

Both Nexus and Celsius received cease and desist letters from the New York Attorney General. Nexus and Celsius are lending platforms targeting private investors.

**Finally...**

A new survey suggests 11.4% of adults around the world own crypto. Nigeria, Malaysia and Australia have the highest rate of adoption. Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Philippines, Mexico and the US make up the top 10.

**Staking and Yield Farming**

Each week we provide the latest APRs from leading staking and yield farming platforms together with news from the industry.

Staking and yield farming has been a major driver in the huge growth in the DeFi sector. Investors are being enticed by the massive APRs on offer. Totally new projects tempting investors with returns of 10,000+ % are able to attract a deluge of money from investors who don’t seem concerned with the high risks involved. Our weekly review looks at the best platforms out there and the ones to avoid. We attempt to weed out the platforms that we think won’t stand the test of time.

**Guest Article**

**A dive into Don’t KYC’s anonymous credit card**

DKYC offers the simplest crypto off-ramp on Binance Smart Chain in the form of anonymous prepaid credit cards. Earn rewards, spend worldwide. With DKYC you no longer need confusing cross-chain conversions or long wait times to realize your crypto earnings at 37 million retailers.

The DKYC team plans to release the world’s first fintech NFT series with real utility during Q4 2021. The collection of designs is set to depict financial freedom, anonymity, and promote the quest to eliminate global financial inequality. The NFTs will contain an embedded range of unique financial perks for their owners and donations to relevant charities. Moreover, an in-built staking system will generate rewards while the NFTs are held. These NFTs will be mintable via the DKYC website and eventually tradable on rFind out more on [dontkyc.com](https://dontkyc.com/)

DKYC is launching its new DPay blockchain-based payment solution to connect the Binance Smart Chain to real-world spending without merchant fees or proprietary hardware. DPay allows users to spend their tokens directly from the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). With DKYC and DPay, users won’t need to disclose their shopping behaviors, pay exorbitant merchant fees, or wait around for payments to be confirmed.

SOL,Altcoin,$CHEEKS is IMO one of the only non scammy SOL coins out there,"I've been rugged and scammed more times than I like to admit.  However I have found a project that lets me sleep soundly at night.   The SOL ticker is $CHEEKS. 

The reason why I am so hype about this coin are a few reasons. 

1. The dev is a doxed high stakes poker player named Rob Kuhn, who has a lot of high net worth friends and contacts that puts him a tier above all the low tier devs looking to scam

(poker profile:  https://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player.php?a=r&n=199312)

2. He has spent thousands of his own money for onboarding KOLs, hiring artists, youtubers, paying for CMC, and other cex listings

3.  The community over the past month has grown to 3k in tg organically and over 4k token holders

4.  The meme videos that have been produced are A - tier list of the likings of PONKE and PEPE

5. Dev is always in voice chat, open about the project and has made it known that he is here to promote a safe coin to buy without the fear of being rugged.  

  
The coin has been sitting around a 5mm market cap for about 25 days and I think is primed to break out. 

Per the rules, you will have to do the research yourselves but best place to start would be looking at the official twitter @[CHEEKS\_ON\_SOL](https://x.com/CHEEKS_ON_SOL) and from there find the CA and the TG links.

SOL,Altcoin,Deep Dive on Solana ($SOL)- NOT a Shitcoin and The Most Undervalued Top 15 Altcoin (IMO),"Hello! Wanted to share my thoughts on Solana, a blockchain platform that I believe has the most upside potential of the top \~15 cryptocurrencies currently on the market.

Coinmarket Cap Link - [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/)

**The Founding Story (**[Source](https://docs.solana.com/history)**)**

* **Solana's Founder Anatoly Yakovenko spent the bulk of his professional career at Qualcomm, Dropbox, and Mesosphere** where he spent a lot of time designing distributed systems and figuring out how to get different systems of software and hardware to talk to each other
* It was at Qualcomm that Anatoly met two of his other **Solana co-founders, Greg Fitzgerald and Stephen Akridge** and the three of them spent nearly a decade working together
* **Greg had an expertise in languages** and compilers and he convinced Anatoly to migrate Solana’s codebase from the C programming language to Rust and became the CTO of Solana
* **Stephen led the GPU backend that constantly beat Nvidia** and he demonstrated that massive amounts of time could be saved through GPUs leading Anatoly to recruit him to the team in early 2018
* The **Solana founding team had about a decade of experience working together** solving complex software and hardware problems at Qualcomm and **you don’t find many founding teams with such deep qualified shared work histories like this in the crypto space**
* Solana was the name of a beach in San Diego where the three of them would often surf so the name doesn’t really have particular significance beyond that

**Proof of Work vs. Stake vs. History**

* **What sets Solana apart from its competitors is its core innovation, Proof of History**
* To understand Proof of History and why it’s different, we first need to go over the method Bitcoin made famous which is proof of work and this is what Ethereum currently uses as well (explaining this for the beginners on the sub)
   * For **proof of work**, when person A sends a transaction to person B through a blockchain, there are 1000s of computers also known as miners that work to confirm the transaction by solving tiny math problems and once a number of computers agree that a transaction is correct, then the transaction goes through, a block is produced, and the computers are rewarded with tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum
      * **This basically is the essence of the buzzword decentralization** you hear so often because instead of one centralized system like the US Treasury that mints money, a crowd of people are earning money in the form of tokens through computers
      * There are large mining farms across the world that have thousands of computers making computations to earn tokens through Proof of Work and this has caused many to worry about all the electricity consumption cryptocurrency mining is resulting in
      * **But the bigger problem with proof of work is that it’s much too slow** with Bitcoin and Ethereum both struggling to scale beyond 15 transactions per second and **in addition to that, average fees per transaction currently (as of 5/19/21) sit at** [$13 for bitcoin](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m) **and** [$21 for Ethereum](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#3m) which is just way too high
   * In interviews, Anatoly states that he views Bitcoin and Ethereum more as revolutionary proof of concept products rather than platforms structured to serve worldwide audiences (debatable point of view ofc)
      * **Bitcoin** proved that cryptography could be used to create currencies while **Ethereum** proved that blockchain technology could be used for smart contracts BUT **neither were built with the knowledge of how massive crypto would get and how transaction fees would skyrocket**
* The next development to improve upon Proof of Work is called **Proof of Stake**, which is something Ethereum is trying to migrate to but there have been many delays
   * **In proof of work,** the miners who are willing to spend more on energy consumption are selected to confirm the transactions on the blockchain
   * **In proof of stake,** miners are called validators and validators are chosen based on the amount of money they lock away or how much they have ""staked"" and the more validators have staked, the more likely they will be chosen to confirm transactions and thus earn tokens
      * If a bad actor tries to attack the network or do something sketchy, the tokens he/she has ""staked"" will be taken away (this is known as slashing) and provides a layer of protection against bad actors
      * **PoS completely gets rid of the need to consume massive amounts of energy** and is a much more sophisticated approach that many cryptocurrencies have migrated to
* This is where Solana's **Proof of History** comes in
   * Solana still uses proof of stake as its method of verifying blocks, but Anatoly pushed it forward by creating a consensus mechanism called Proof of History and this is at the core is what makes Solana unique
   * **The trouble with decentralized systems is that you have thousands of computers working together to verify transactions but they each use their own clocks and don’t have a common notion of time**
      * As a result, most blockchain infrastructures require validators to talk to each other to agree on the time before verifying transactions and producing the next block
      * **This results in notable delays in the network and is the reason Bitcoin produces blocks only every 10 minutes and Ethereum every 15 seconds**
      * Here's an analogy: imagine that there is an army of 1000 soldiers who in this analogy represent each validator. Each soldier has his own watch and so the time to each soldier is what he believes the time to be, but the actual time may be off by a few seconds or minutes
      * This means that if a general wants the solders to execute an order at a very specific time, he needs to get all the soldiers to agree on the time before that order is fulfilled correctly which is basically what is happening in current blockchain infrastructures
   * **With Proof of History, all computers on the network agree on a universal time through what’s called a SHA-256, sequential-hashing verifiable delay function**
      * **Proof of history results in 0 delays in the network and no waiting around for other validators to agree on the time**
      * **As a result, while most of the latest proof of stake blockchains have blocktimes of a few seconds, Solana is able to achieve blocktimes of 0.4 seconds, and this is why Proof of History is a giant leap forward**

**Why Solana is a Gamechanger (**[reference this chart for this section](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium)**)**

* The primary reason is **Solana’s ability to scale**
   * Solana can currently achieve **blocktimes of 0.4 seconds** and **65,000 transactions per second** which makes **Solana one of the fastest blockchain infrastructures in the world**
   * What’s more is that as internet bandwidth and CPU and GPU improve, **block times can reduce and transactions per second can increase theoretically scale to infinity** with a 1gb network supporting about 700,000 TPS and a 10 gb network being able to support 7 million TPS
      * To be fair, this is true for most other crypto platforms as well
   * In comparison, **Visa requires 65,000 transactions per second**, and the **NASDAQ exchange requires 500,000, so Solana can support databases at any scale**
      * This is an extremely important development because applications as large as Facebook or exchanges like the NASDAQ can eventually be built on the Solana platform without performance issues and without enormous fees
* Solana’s capabilities are also better understood when compared against the competition
   * **Solana currently supports the highest transactions per second for a crypto with a working product** (this is from my knowledge, please correct me if I'm mistaken)
      * Though Ethereum 2.0 can scale to 100K transactions per second, the upgrade has yet to come
      * Cardano's hydra solution can scale to 1MM per second, but has no mainnet (launching in August 2021)
   * But more importantly, **Solana is miles ahead in block time versus the rest of the field due to proof of history and block times will also come down with time as well** with Anatoly on the record saying he envisions messages across Solana traveling at the speed of light
   * In addition, **Solana also offers extremely low transaction costs at $0.00001 meaning that 1 million transactions would only cost $10 and Solana also has more validators than the rest** of the field besides Avalanche ([chart reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium))
   * Github stars is a bit of a vanity metric and are similar to Facebook likes but basically even though Solana has only been around for a few years, it has a **pretty high number of Github stars which slightly demonstrates the interest developers have in the project** ([chart reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium))
   * And lastly **Solana is a complete layer 1 solution** meaning that everything is built on the Solana blockchain vs. Ethereum 2.0 and Polkadot which are two of Solana’s biggest competitors which utilize sharding ([chart reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium))
      * Sharding isn't a dealbreaker based on my research and I'm an ETH holder just to be clear but I do think having everything on a Layer 1 solution is cleaner
* All of this is why **Sam Bankman Fried, a prominent figure in the crypto community and founder of the exchange FTX, chose to operate Serum on Solana after a year of testing out different options**
   * In case you’re unfamiliar with it, FTX has been growing rapidly over the past 12 months and as a fun fact, the exchange recently paid for the rights to call the Miami Heat Arena FTX Arena

**Why I Believe Solana Can 3X-5X**

* The logic behind this is very simple and relates to **relative valuation** and this also is based on the assumption that the crypto market continues its bull run
   * Personally, I think we're in the mid to late stages of a crypto bubble, so what I've written below will not come true if the market collapses
* **As of 5/18/21, Solana's Market Cap = $14.6BN, Polkadot = $36.4BN, Cardano = $64.5BN**
   * I think Solana's tech makes it a pretty **undervalued cryptocurrency** just compared to other projects currently on the market
      * I'm not trying to ding other cryptos or say that other projects are bad, just saying I think Solana should be worth more than it is today based on these market caps
   * Why is this? I'm not sure, and perhaps it's because it's a relatively new project (founded in 2018) vs. the other ones so not as many investors are aware
      * **It's also possible I may have missed something, so please let me know if there is reason to doubt Solana or if other projects are just far superior**
   * Anyhow, all this is why if I had to choose one coin the top 15 right now, I would bet on Solana, and I am personally invested in it right now (for full disclosure)

**TLDR**:  Solana is one of the most performant blockchains in the crypto space, using an innovative technology called Proof of History to solve the scalability problem currently faced by earlier technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0. Solana has the potential to 3X-5X, considering that it has superior technology compared to many competitors that have much higher market caps and much fewer actual projects in their ecosystems.",37,2021-05-18 16:46:40,17

SOL,Altcoin,Solana's Rise Fuels DeFi Growth and Staking Opportunities,"Solana (SOL) has experienced a notable boost in performance in the past few months, mainly thanks to its distinctive blockchain technology providing high speed, affordable transactions, and scalability. The improved performance boosts user satisfaction and backs the expanding network of decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects, establishing Solana as a top competitor in the cryptocurrency industry.  
  
Bitget and Binance are now offering restaking services for SOL in order to capitalize on Solana's growing popularity, enabling users to earn BNSol and BGSol recpectively which can be used for restaking. The APR (Binance 10.45% and Bitget 22%) on these exchanges further encourages users to stake their sol on this platform.  
  
Bitget recently launch its BGSOL staking which has exceeded $10 million in under 24 hours, demonstrating significant user engagement. Users can restake BGSol on Bitget flexible saving to earn more APR. This shows exchanges increase interest in deFi and could position Sol as the top token soon.

SOL,Altcoin,[URGENT] DYOR on this Project Before it's too Late,"Ladies and Gentlemen,

We went through a tough couple of weeks.

The recent events led to BTC dropping as low as **$53K**, causing **fear in the market** and many weak hands to either sell their entire holdings or scale down on their positions at the **worst possible occasion**.

https://preview.redd.it/zb3hafyajvdd1.jpg?width=963&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bea615499825787344eed404f90213cd2fa02847

  
Just as there couldn't be a worse moment to sell your beloved crypto, there wasn't a better time to get a position or top up your bags **at such a discount**.

 

When you have your eyes on **good projects with strong fundamentals**, you need to take calculated risks and buy the jeets' bags.

After only 5 days from a moment of ""**Extreme Fear**"", based on the ""**Fear and Greed Index**"", we're now back at a decent level of ""**Greed**"".

https://preview.redd.it/pmhj6nfcjvdd1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e42f279382b2fd59527fb383b61b37b8db6925f1

  
One of the ways to distinguish a good project from a less good one is to pay attention to **how the chart responds** when the market goes up after a dip.

Good projects with strong fundamentals have already **shown signs of a strong reversal**, gaining **50%**, **100%** or even more from the lowest point touched during the market crash.



One of those projects is certainly **$KENDU (Kendu Inu),** which went from as low as **$68M** back to almost **$150M** as soon as the market showed some strength.

 

That is an extremely bullish indicator to look for in a project.

https://preview.redd.it/h87d2ntdjvdd1.jpg?width=871&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2288fcc8d9531332c4aef39aacc4c862f4b10593

**COMMUNITY SENTIMENT**

Another important thing to look for is **how active the community is during a market crash**.

 

**Most ""projects"" go straight to zero or almost in this phase.** People in the TG group go silent, stop raiding, are sad, and eventually start looking around at the next shiny thing.

This never happens at **$KENDU**.

There is such a **big core group of OGs** who are always ready to **work and lead by example**. People coming to the Telegram group are always surprised by the warm welcome and the work ethic of the **$KENDU army**.

**The Kendu Inu community is more active during the dips than most communities are at ATHs.**

You want a **very active community** that is **always positive** about the project and ready to spread the word, especially when all the others around you are **too lazy and depressed** to do so.

https://preview.redd.it/cbf2wjpgjvdd1.jpg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bb459e0141fb998c9ba991fd2e300793ff1b977

  
**COMMUNITY GROWTH**

**But how fast is this strong Kendu community growing?**

Well, let's look at the data. Data does not lie.

 

**The project launched on Feb 21st.**

**May 1st -->** **160** members of the subreddit - **1300** on-chain holders – listed on **1 CEX**

**Jun 1st --> 1345** members of the subreddit- **6000** on-chain holders – listed on **2 CEXs**

**July 19th -->** **3554** members of the subreddit – **12701** on-chain holders – listed on **14 CEXs**

https://preview.redd.it/ay6ubk5jjvdd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98f10c2f3a8d6be101230fe6095bc25a64c97007

**100% organic**, after a slow start, Kendu Inu has seen exponential growth in the last couple of months.

**Kendu Inu has a very strong floor** thanks to diamond-handed holders with a big vision, a beautiful chart, **holders count growing daily** and good supply distribution where nobody holds more than roughly **2%.**

 

**That is the result of a combination of:**

-            Fair launch

-            Organic growth

-            No supply to KOLs

-            No big influencers calling you from the start and letting jeets form the floor.

-            An army with an extreme work ethic

**SUPPORTED BY SHYTOSHI KUSAMA  - TOP 50 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN CRYPTO –**

**Shytoshi Kusama** was included in the list of the **top 50 most influential people in the whole crypto space** earlier this year, as he has a huge reputation and a **multi-billion dollar project** under his leadership.

He recently left an interview where he said his goal for **SHIB** is to reach **One trillion dollar** market cap ($1000b).

He would never risk any of that to support a project that is either a **scam** or a mere **pump and dump.**

As of today, Kusama has followed the page on X and joined the Telegram group to say hi and ask for details after **$KENDU** went from **$2.8M** to **$60M** market cap in just a few days.



He asked: ""**Why up so much? lol**""



It has also been confirmed that he has been holding a fat bag of **$KENDU** since at least **$1M** market cap.

Even though all details have yet to be revealed, it is known that **$KENDU** will play a role in the Shib ecosystem, which might explain Shytoshi's involvement in Kendu Inu.

Make no mistake, though, Miazaki has always said that **Kendu has its own identity** and will not just be one of the small dogs existing under the SHIB umbrella.

At the same time, being a partner of the 2^(nd) biggest meme coin that ever existed from such an early stage is an extraordinary achievement.

https://preview.redd.it/40n7n95rjvdd1.jpg?width=848&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50b589b892f9d21e99e0c28b03f2118bdc922d41

  
**COINBASE LIKES THE STOCK**

News from last week: **Coinbase Wallet** showcased **Kendu Inu** in their new video ad (you can find it pinned on their X page)

**$KENDU** is the only meme project displayed there that is not in the multi-billions of market cap.



To be specific, these are the market caps of all the coins/tokens displayed in the video ad (at the time of the video being posted):

**KENDU**: $104 Million  
**USDC**: $33 Billion  
**SOL**: $66 Billion  
**BTC**: $1.2 Trillion  
**ETH**: $371 Billion  
**USDT**: $112 Billion  
**MATIC**: $5.0 Billion  
**PEPE**: $3.7 Billion



The second smallest meme **coin** in the video is $PEPE, which is sitting at $5.1b, about 40x from where $KENDU is right now.

**Read between the lines, people.**

The craziest thing about it all is that Dev said he had nothing to do with the Coinbase video ad.

He said ""I wish I could tell you I have buddies at Coinbase, but I don't. **That's because of you guys.**""

**Community-driven** projects focused on **organic growth** are the best.

**KENDU CHADS IS 99% COMPLETE**

Miazaki has always referred to Kendu as an **ecosystem**, it's always been part of the name of the TG group even. He says the **Kendu Inu Ecosystem** **will be the biggest in DeFi**, meaning there are big plans for Kendu in these coming months.

 

Kendu Inu's first **dAPP** is about to be released to the public.

**Kendu Chads** is not the final boss, it is only **the first piece of a big puzzle**.

Kendu Miazaki has left hints about what that may or may not be throughout the weeks.

 

**What we do know about Kendu Chads to date, is:**

* You need at least **5M** tokens to participate
* It is not staking
* You can earn **ETH** with it

 

There are no (and never will be) ""**sell the news**"" events at **Kendu Inu**. Therefore, details about Kendu will only be known once the **dApp** is out and ready to be used.

 

Even though Miazaki is an ""alpha vault"" (meaning he does not release info on the future on Kendu beforehand; he creates and then tells you what it is once it's done), he's hinted at the fact that **the goal is for Kendu to last for a long time, definitely more than a cycle**.

He once responded positively to a question from someone asking him if Kendu was supposed to maintain his value during a bear market.

https://preview.redd.it/s5ix9mfxjvdd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1d565ff999ee91ed8b967f58354113a219af522

  
**WHERE IS THE MARKET HEADED?**

It is clear that the cycle is, so far, repeating itself.

**There is no better entry than now** if you want to get into a project. Take a look at the picture below (right side) and see where we currently stand:

**On the final dip that usually precedes the start of the real bull run.**

We had the **BTC ETF** come out in January, and we have the **ETH ETF** going live just a few days from now.

**Rate cuts are planned for Q4**, and that, combined with the expected result of the **US elections**, should signal the start of the most fun part of the **bull run**.

There is going to be so much money flowing into the space.

Every project that is not a scam and has done well these past few months will inevitably do well in the coming bull run.

And when there is so much greed in the air that every shitcoin is in the green, what do you think is going to happen to such a strong project like [$KENDU](https://x.com/search?q=%24KENDU&src=cashtag_click)?

""Multi billions is not the goal. It is my standard"" - Kendu Miazaki.

SOL,Altcoin,CME Gap,"11/1/2024 10:00 PM #Bitcoin Update:

The #BTC/USDT price has now formed a new CME gap at $69,249, where we should see it trading around over the weekend. I believe the price will move up to the $69,990 resistance, then come back to the CME gap before breaking out towards the $71,979 resistance. 📈

As with any pattern, we could still see it fall below the CME gap, breaking the bottom trendline of the rising wedge and dropping to $69,000, or possibly the $67,000 support, before moving back up. Either way—up or down—90% of the time, the price moves toward the CME gap like a magnet! 🧲✨ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/",2,2024-11-02 02:10:59,52
SOL,Altcoin,13 Reasons Why You Should Hold a Fat Bag of $KENDU (Or Get One ASAP) - NFA,"https://preview.redd.it/4znedcfcrcad1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=349d39e376eea7ab1f77ba6aa50910706a6ffe9f

  


**1)  SHYTOSHI KUSAMA INVOLVED**

**Shiba Inu lead Dev Shytoshi Kusama**, considered among the **top 50** most influential people in the whole crypto space, is confirmed to be following Kendu Inu and holding a bag since at least $1M market cap.

**Kendu Miazaki**, Kendu Inu Dev, is one of his friends, and he made sure to bring Shy in at the right time.

 

 

**2)  HUGE WALLETS APING (MULTIMILLIONAIRES)**

Wallets with **10+ million dollars' worth of ETH** that had been inactive since the last cycle got back to life only to buy Kendu Inu.

It has even been confirmed that a **Middle Eastern Prince** holds a bag.

Other millionaires (and multimillionaires) are confirmed holders and part of the ecosystem as well.

 

 

**3)  KENDU MIAZAKI**

Kendu Inu Dev ""**Miazaki**"" is an unhinged individual always ready to rock & roll.

He is a **SHIB multimillionaire** (his bag was worth 50+ million dollars at ATH IIRC), and that explains the close connection with **Shytoshi** and other **SHIB Ogs** that are now part of Kendu.

Apart from his **incredible work ethic** and **crazy personality**, him being a loaded individual makes the project much easier to trust because one of the most common reasons for projects to fail is broke millionaire-wannabe devs who can't resist the urge of dumping on everybody to make a quick buck.

He recently admitted on a X Spaces that he doesn't even have that big of a bag. He said ""**I’m maybe top 20, if even that**”.

He always says he does not do this for money because he already has money. He does this because he likes to “**build**”  and to allow other common people to become “**stupid rich**”.

 

 

**4)  COMMUNITY**

What can I even say about the **Kendu Army**? Everybody knows about it.

With unmatched work ethic and always ready to spread the word, the Kendu Army is what makes Kendu…**KENDU**!

People who join Kendu go from being dirty, tiny-handed jeets to 7.6ft tall, muscular chads with strong and big hands.

You’re soon taught that success depends on you and to ask yourself, “**What can I do for $KENDU?**” instead of waiting for the team to release the “**next big thing**” and hoping for a pump while doing absolutely nothing to help.

**We’ve got relentless shillers** on any social media known to humanity, people making Kendu **energy drinks**, people managing a Kendu **merch store**, people with Kendu **tattoos**, people smashing plates on their heads in the name of Kendu, and much more.

 

 

https://preview.redd.it/yj18zclypcad1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cc6f00a283f679392bf8bf5a874e7767a353358



**5)  ORGANIC GROWTH**

Kendu Inu fully believes in organic growth.

Apart from financing for the first **CEX** listing, so that “**normies**” were able to join the project without having to go through **DeFi** if not tech-savvy enough to avoid being scammed, **Kendu Inu does not pay for any listing, call on Tg, post on X, video on YT or any other thing you can think of**.

All the influencers that talk about Kendu or CEXs that listed us have had to buy supply from the liquidity pool like any other person.

Kendu Miazaki explained this from the very beginning.

“**It might be slower, but it works**.” is what he used to say.

**Organic growth allows you to build a strong floor of diamond-handed holders** who fully believe in the project and do not believe in random FUD.

On the other hand, if you build your floor with people sent by influencers, everybody is ready to jeet at the first chance because they’re just there for a quick buck and do not see the bigger picture.

 

 

**6)  UTILITY AND SHIB ECOSYSTEM**

Even though all details have yet to be revealed, it is known that **$KENDU** will play a role in the Shib ecosystem, which might explain Shytoshi’s involvement in Kendu Inu.

Make no mistake, though, Miazaki has always said that **Kendu has its own identity** and will not just be one of the small dogs existing under the SHIB umbrella.

One of the first Kendu utilities, named **Kendu Chads**, will be released in the following weeks after being thoroughly tested for months by Miazaki’s team of developers.

 

https://preview.redd.it/iizlff0bqcad1.jpg?width=1195&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a5643a5c028cd785132e6788480639d6bf2ebb6





**7)  THE DOG OF THIS CYCLE**

“Never two without three”.

People love dogs and always will. **DOGE** and **SHIB** were the first two dogs to reach **$10b**+ market cap.

**$KENDU** has everything it needs to be the third this coming bull run.

 

 

**8) 275M MARKET CAP WHEN THE MARKET WAS BLEEDING**

Kendu Inu reached an **ATH** of over **$275M market cap** when the whole crypto market, from BTC to all the shitcoins, was bleeding badly.

**Kendu is your hedge against the market** and will not wait for BTC to reach new ATHs before jumping to $1b market cap and beyond.

With that being said, when the actual bull run starts and all the random shitcoins are in green, what do you think will happen to a **strong project** like Kendu?

Multi billions are programmed.

 



**9)  BUILT ON ETH**

**Kendu Inu is only on ETH**. Love it or hate it, Ethereum is the king of all chains and sees fewer scams than all the other jeet chains such as SOL and BASE.

Since Kendu Inu is on ETH, and the liquidity pool is paired with ETH (KENDU:ETH), **when ETH goes up in value, so does KENDU**. As simple as that.

The news of the coming **ETH ETF** is super bullish news for all KENDU holders, both **short-term** and **long-term** investors.

 



**10)  GREAT-LOOKING CHART**

Even CMC, in their recent article, admitted that $KENDU chart looks very good and **on the verge of a breakout** from a pure TA standpoint, and they’re not aware of all the **alphas** behind the projects and all the future implementations that are going to be unveiled.

So, if you like technical analysis, you will like Kendu Inu chart.

**11)  GOAL: FIRST MEME COIN TO EVER CROSS $100b**

While every other project in the meme sphere tries hard to reach $1b market cap, at Kendu inu, we think that to be an embarrassing goal.

While Miazaki says that **“$10b is programmed**”, meaning it is inevitable, the real goal that excites our community is to be the first meme coin ever to cross $100b market cap.

Miazaki’s bio on Telegram says: “**Taking $KENDU to $100 BILLION and beyond!**”

Many experts expect this to be a “**super cycle**” and even more a “**meme super cycle**”, meaning we expect not only more liquidity to be deployed in the whole crypto space compared to 2021, but also that **meme coins will grab a much bigger % of that liquidity** flowing around compared to last cycle.

**We can then expect new ATHs for well-established projects** such as DOGE and SHIB, and that’s why, at KENDU, we’re working towards that $100b MC goal, which will not look as unrealistic at the peak of the bull run as it may does right now.

 



**12)  LOW MARKET CAP ≠ MORE GAINS**

Many people have been led to believe that the lower the market cap of a certain token, the better chance of making a 100x or 1000x. That is SO wrong and misleading.

90% or more of the “projects”, especially when launched on Solana or Base, **are complete scams**. Period.

The other 0.99% are projects created with the best intentions, but that, unfortunately, are going absolutely nowhere.

**Kendu Inu, at this stage, is bulletproof**. It has proved its value to everybody. “**We’re too big to fail**” is what Miazaki always says.

Kendu is going nowhere but up.

With such ambitious goals, a **100x means reaching about $15b market cap** (at the time of this writing), which is far from being out of reach for Kendu, especially considering we are about to enter what it’s supposed to be the **biggest cycle ever** (especially for meme coins).

Another thing to keep in mind is that when you invest in **super-low MC projects**, liquidity is so thin that any whale exiting their position leads to a cascade of sales caused by fear, especially since it’s not uncommon for investors of small projects to hold 5-10% of the total supply.

On bigger projects, instead, since liquidity is way thicker, you can **enter and exit your positions more accurately** without having nightmares about being rugged while asleep.

**13) BEAUTIFUL SUPPLY REDISTRIBUTION**

At Kendu Inu, redistribution is ongoing **24/7**. When the market cap goes up, the number of holders goes up. When the market cap goes down, even significantly, the number of holders still goes up!

And that’s counting on-chain holders only! **With millions of $ of daily volume on CEXs**, God knows how many holders we actually have.



To make money with altcoins, especially memes, you need to understand two things:

1. What a good project is
2. Buy when everybody else is afraid to do it.

Kendu IS a good project.

Now, you have the opportunity to buy or top up your bags at 40% of the ATH.



If you like Kendu, this is the best time to become part of the army. See you on the other side!

SOL,Altcoin,What got me into Kendu and has kept me in Kendu a soon to be altcoin,"I have been in crypto since 2017. I made plenty of mistakes (round tripping coins, twice) and missed plenty of opportunities. One thing I was smart enough to avoid was memecoins, but that changed, April of 2024. 

I finally had a plan and had followed it with BTC and was waiting on my rebuy/next move. This plan came from years of watching videos and learning about crypto, in particular the BTC cycles. My crypto/meme arc is fascinating as I got rugged for one SOL- on my second meme- because I had IRL stuff going on for 90 minutes after token launch and figured I should be good. Best loss ever as it motivated myself to research and learn about the scum bag swamp of memecoins. I dug into reddit and followed the poster history/profile uncovering the whole aspect of paid services and paid upvotes to drive traffic. I might have gotten a little intense as I invited one of the posters offering paid services into a Telegram chat (I am not including the screenshots of those again) to learn even more. One funny thing is this human seemed to think I wanted money or something.



When that learning and research ended is when I got introduced to KENDU. I was in a Telegram with some of the ‘victims’ and one of them suggested Kendu. I put victims in quotes because so many people are desperate for a quick buck while another portion of people just enjoy gambling. I do not in this regard. The casino is always open and someone is always waiting to steal your money. Trust me for 99% of us the house always wins, but  Kendu is the anti casino and a safe bet that allows me to sleep at night. 



One thing that attracted me to Kendu is the ethos highlighted the lessons I had learned about investing while at the same time reinforcing the values I picked up in my crypto/meme arc (Don't pay for anything, pic a horse and stick with it, stick to the plan, etc.), BUT the concept of working for my bag was revolutionary to me. Feeling like I have some power in this was a liberating feeling that I have really taken to.



It wasn't long after finishing more research on KENDU, asking questions, and listening to everything I could that I pivoted my plan to center it around KENDU. I haven't looked back and love the community and work I have put in! If you want a deep dive into the community here is what I posted a couple days ago best way is to come in the TG and see it for yourself): https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem/comments/1eeq1v2/kendu\_community\_updated\_info\_journal/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button



With less than 24 hours to the Kendu Chads timer hitting zero and presumably the release of said dApp, this is a really cool moment for me. I have been called a bot and all types of scam-centric words, but this release will be my affirmation of a choice well made. I don’t know if the price will go up or down, but it doesn’t matter as this feature seems guaranteed to provide some real Utility in ‘earning cold hard ETH’ and it means I didn’t larp for upvotes or to increase my karma. I researched and listened and learned and I was correct to trust what I found and what I believed. I also know that the community will keep working and that Miazaki is built very different. He has said many things in the Spaces and they are all very real and come to fruition. It is not too late to do research and check out our Telegram. This cycle will heat up again for the real bull run and Kendu is already primed to take full advantage of that with the first aspect of the Ecosystem releasing and a ravenous and hard working community tearing up socials everyday. I believe everyone should have some exposure (hopefully to the tune of 5 million Kendu) to Kendu, but this isn’t financial advice. This is a call to do your own research! This is my real reddit account and will still be my real account when this crypto cycle is over.

TLDR: I have stayed in Kendu (on ETH…happy belated birthday) because of the community, OG developer experience and skill, vast connections, potential, road map (Ecosystem not a memecoin with a glass ceiling to its potential), and dare I say fun.

SOL,Altcoin,Let's build a meme together. Will this work?,"After all my losses and failed attempts in crypto, I thought about creating a memecoin as a form of representation. At first, I wanted to call it ""Losers,"" but eventually, I changed the name to ""WorldofLosers."" My plan was to create an OpenbookMarketID, set up a liquidity pool, and somehow get it out to the community.

I always feel optimistic before starting something new, but I also get anxious. While setting up the OpenbookMarketID, I made a costly mistake and ended up losing 3 [SOL ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/)(around $600). That loss hit me hard, and I’m still working on forgiving myself for it. Ironically, it felt like the name of the coin reflected what had happened.

Later, I discovered pump fun, which made it possible to actually create my memecoin, WorldofLosers ($WOLOSR). Even though I was able to launch it, I still need support from the community to get people trading it. I’ve read that you need about 40 SOL to create enough trade volume and complete the bonding curve, but I don’t have that kind of funding or backing from friends.

So here I am, reaching out to you, fellow redditors. If you've experienced losses in investments that didn’t ruin your life but gave you something to laugh about, come trade $WOLOSR on pump fun. Let’s build this meme together. Who knows—maybe losers can be winners too! If the coin gains traction, I plan to build a website (I already own the domain) and grow the community

SOL,Altcoin,Nacho krc-20 guide,"Since people are talking about KRC-20 token minting and prices, I thought of writing about the biggest token on Kaspa, NACHO

It was inspired by Shai Wyborski's pet cat Nacho! lol. Shai is one of the main researchers and founders of Kaspa. He even thanked Nacho cat on his graduation! This token was 100% fairly minted. This token also has the highest number of holders as of today. Not many wallets hold more than 1% supply of Nacho. Great distribution tbh. It has the best background story for a meme coin on Kaspa, in my opinion.

official website: nachowyborski .xyz  
Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nacho-the-kat/

Current market cap: $42m 

More details about the token: [https://kas.fyi/token/krc20/NACHO](https://kas.fyi/token/krc20/NACHO)

This token can be bought on KSPR bot: Link can be found on [kas.fyi](http://kas.fyi) website

The NACHO team is pretty good. I attended their call on discord recently. The creators were patient in explaining everything. The immediate targets on the roadmap include CEX listing, starting a Kaspa pool, improving Governance, and creating NFT collection. The roadmap for next year is not ready yet. They have something called Kaspa Alliance for Transparency for 2025.

I feel that one meme coin on each chain will have 3-5% of main chain's market cap during the bull run. The second best might have 2-3% of main chain's market cap. Nacho is the main contender for the first place on Kaspa network. Once it gets listed on CEX, it will explode for sure. I cannot wait for the bull run! Even if it captures 1% of Kaspa's market cap during peak bull run, it is gonna have a MC of $300m, assuming Kaspa crosses $1(I am sure that this is inevitable).

I also see that the team has been collecting funds for CEX listing. 

Nacho can be traded on:

SOL,Altcoin,My moon bag for the next bull run," These are my bags for the next bull run. I already made over 10X, so I am convinced it will pump really hard. Some are based on utility, while others are just based on community hype.    


First on my list is Floki. Yeah,  it’s a meme, but the community is really strong, and they are doing a lot of charity programs in Africa, which means they have good VC backing. I think it might flip Shiba, and it's just about 2B MC.  

The second is QANX; it’s a possible 100X; this one has utility; and its blockchain just got adopted by a country in the EU, which I believe is a huge buy signal. Now that a country has started using blockchain because of its security, I believe banks might get in too soon, and you know what they say: follow where the money goes.   

The last, but not least, is SOL. I wrote a thread a few months ago about this, and whoever ever bought SOL with me at $10 will be in huge profit now. IMO, SOL might flip ETH, as we can see many are beginning to jump on it, and the new memecoin trend will be in the SOL ecosystem rather than ETH.  

Anyway, feel free to share with me what you are holding so I can add that to my list of coins to research

SOL,Altcoin,Here are my top altcoin picks for next year," As you can see, there is a high chance of having a bull run soon, as BTC has shown a good price move to the upside for several months now. IMO, it's wise to start accumulating gradually.  

But the real question is what to buy and why I think it’s the best option. I will only be listing the two tokens I’m accumulating now. One is a large cap, and the other is a low cap. Both are my biggest bags, and if you do proper research, you will agree with me that they have a high chance of leading the next bull run.  

The first is SOLANA; it's funny because I personally FUD SOL a few months ago before it had that huge price move back up. Recently, I have noticed SOL has started gaining a lot of traction, and memecoin is now gradually shifting from ETH to the Solana ecosystem. If this trend continues, then a lot of people will end up buying into SOL, and I predict the price will be around $500 for its next ATH.   

The second, which is a low-MC gem and is gradually gaining traction, is QANX. It’s a layer 1 hybrid blockchain that is EVM-compatible. One of the features about it that I feel will blow up so much is the fact that it allows developers to code smart contracts in any programming language, which QAN aims to use to onboard over 20 million developers into the blockchain, which I believe even If they are able to achieve 10% of that, then this layer 1 blockchain will be greater than ETH. And my price prediction for QANX is $1 in the next bull run.  

Anyway, please feel free to share with me what altcoins you are buying as well.

SOL,Altcoin,"It's an open discussion, what are your plans ahead of the coming bull run, are you buying anything now or not?","I remembered the last bear market when a friend advised me to buy ETH, but I was hesitant. My first purchase later was around 3000, and I planned to hold to 10K if possible, but the bear market had other plans. To avoid repeating the same mistake, I've decided to conduct research, compile a list of a few good crypto projects that I believe will lead the next bull run, and then ask you guys to vote on which ones you think are good and which ones you think are bad.

The first on my list is potential Solana. I know some people don't like it because of centralization issues and the fact that it has had a few shutdowns, but I believe it's a great blockchain with a lot of great potential. I have DCA from $60, and I may still buy more. Some advantages of SOL include its high scalability, which makes Solana a better blockchain for Dapps such as DEXs and staking protocols.

The following is DOT. Polkadot should not be overlooked either, as it has a fantastic community. It is designed to allow unrelated blockchains to securely interact with one another, allowing value or data to flow between blockchains without the need for an intermediary. It's also intended to be fast and scalable, thanks to the use of numerous parallel blockchains or ""parachains"", that offload much of the processing demand from the main blockchain. Dot has an ATL of $2.69, so buying at $6.27 now isn't a bad idea. I just want to start DCA-ing DOT this month.

I also discovered a low-cap project called Qanplatform. It's a layer 1 quantum-resistant blockchain, which you may have heard of. It recently released QVM, which allows developers to code smart contracts in any programming language. In comparison to EVM, which only allows programming in Solidity, this could be huge for the crypto space in general. It also has several other USPs, such as the quantum-resistant features I mentioned above, which make this chain one of the most secure ever and not hackable by a Quantum computer. I've had DCA-ing QANX since it was 0.014, and I'll be buying more this month to hold for the long term.

The fourth one is MoonRiver, an Ethereum-compatible, smart-contract parachain on Kusama. It is intended to be a companion network to Moonbeam, where it will provide a permanently incentivized canary network. The token name is MOVR and it has several utilities for this decentralized smart contract platform.  I did buy some for around $15 and am still looking for more if possible.

The last one is a meme called TSUKA. It has the same founder as Shiba and I will be gambling in on that, hopefully, it will become the next Shiba.

So guys, what do you think, I’m I good to go? Do I need to add any other gem before the bull run, let me know in the comment section

SOL,Altcoin,Wealth Creation of Bitget on BAN after Binance Listing ,"The listing of $BAN on Binance indicates a major step towards mainstream crypto recognition, potentially attracting a larger, more diverse investor pool. However, Binance's regulatory challenges might be a concern for some investors.

$BAN has seen significant price jumps, moving from a market cap of $170M to $290M in a short span, showcasing high volatility and interest, which is typical for newly listed cryptocurrencies on major exchanges, Bitget traders made use of this Opportunity. 

BAN was listed on Bitget 20 days (3 weeks) before Binance (Futures) and it has surged significantly creating wealth for those who've bought on Bitget 
tolerance.

Each platform brings different strengths to the table for $BAN, with Binance offering broader market access and Bitget providing a specialized trading environment.

For now I'll stick with Bitget listing to get more Opportunity to buy some meme to be ahead of the market

SOL,Altcoin,POWSCHE | Something you can be proud of holding (volume up),"POWSCHE is making a massive impact and I just wanted to share this awesome video with you and talk about some of the highlights on their roadmap: 

**Porsche giveaway at $10 Market cap:** Not only will this be amazing for the community member who wins this but it’s great publicity and it’s a sure way.

**Tesla giveaway to a single mother at $50m market cap:** What an amazing thing to do, reliable transportation can make a huge difference in their lives, providing better access to jobs, education, and essential services.

**Burning a Tesla at $50m market cap:** This is going to be an epic event and has got viral written all over it.   It’s a way for POWSCHE to start reaching an audience that might not necessarily be into Crypto.  It will bring in a lot of eyes and get the attention of many people.  

**Burning a Lamborghini $100m market cap:** If you haven’t heard about POWSCHE by now you will do after the Lambo burn.  POWSCHE is planning on burning the Lamborghini Aventador streamed live for the world to see.   

Again, like the Tesla burn this will be an epic event, there will be a Porsche GT3 RS drifting around it, full production crew with members of the community cheering on the sidelines.  

Imagine how viral the Lambo burn event will be, both social and more traditional media channels will all pick up on this, this is a sure way to make sure that everyone is talking about POWSCHE, this will send the coin to another level, millions of views and it will be a historic crypto event. 

**Porsche 911 GT3 RS giveaway:** So if that wasn’t enough, the Porsche 911 GT3 giveaway is insane.  

I don’t even have to say more about this apart from, if you are a holder and have made it to this mark, you deserve to be entered into this giveaway for being a proper chad.

For me POWSCHE sticks out, miles apart from any other coin in the space.   

Everything they have planned helps attract new investors at every milestones.

Other coins lack this in my opinion, they might make it so far but how are they going to attract others outside of the crypto space?

---

**Altcoin**, the abbreviation for alternative coin, or alternate coin, or all blockchain projects and related currency that exist in addition to Bitcoin.

**Bearish**, a downward trend.

**Block** is a part of the Blockchain and is usually associated with an encrypted hash with the previous block in the block.

**Blockchain**, very neatly explained by [Nieuwsuur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARwzaQV7AwU) (or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD9KAnkZUjU)), but in text: a decentralized database that maintains a data list that can not be manipulated.

**BTC (฿)**. I do not intend to spell out all currencies, but Bitcoin is an exception.

**Bullish**, an upward trend.

**Core wallet**, a wallet that contains the whole blockchain and most of the time delivers tools to give developers the ability to program in or on the blockchain.

**Circulation supply**, number of coins that are actually circulating.

**Dapps** *aka* applications written in the blockchain, which means it's a *d*ecentralized *app*lication *aka* Dapp.

**Electrum wallet**, a light weight wallet to store coins. Doesn’t download the blockchain, but gets the information from a third party.

**Encryption**, data lock that can only be unlocked with a private key.

**Exchange**, sometimes called coinexchange, is the exchange office where buyers and sellers can trade in Bit and Altcoins. Examples are Litebit, BTCdirect, Kraken and Bittrex.

**Fiat** money is a currency without intrinsic value established as money by government regulation or law. Think of $, £, ¥ or €.

**FOMO** means Fear Of Missing Out. As the term suggests, the Bitcoin or an altcoin rises sharply in value and investors take steps without rationale – so emotion – because they are afraid to miss the boat.

**FUD** stands for Fear, Uncertainty & Doubt. In the world of crypto FUD means spreading fear, uncertainty or doubt about a certain blockchain project.

**Hash**, an encryption that can no longer be undone.

**[HODL](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0)**, either hold, but then written wrong. Reportedly a Bitcointalk user wearing a drunk mood over his keyboard. HODL is currently jargon for long-term investor cryptocurrency trader. Nice acronym mentioned in the comments: Hold On Despite Loss.

**[ICO](https://newkidsontheblockchain.nl/en/2017/06/whats-an-ico-and-how-to-participate/)**, Initial Coin Offering. A crowd sale that offers the opportunity to purchase digital coins from a new blockchain project.

**Market cap**: price per coin *x* circulating supply.

**Max Supply**, maximum amount of coins that will ever exist in currency lifetime.

**Miner**, device validating the blockchain (transactions).

**Mining reward**, the reward that a miner receives for the computing power he delivers to check the nodes in the blockchain.

**Mnemonic Phrase** a fancy version of your private key, that is actually used to derive multiple private keys.

**Public key**, publicly accessible “key”, in crypto currency jargon your wallet.

**Private key**, the key to open your wallet.

**Proof of Stake**, verification of the blockchain is done by (wallet) adresses with a certain amount of coins. The more coins means the more authority and computing power for verifying the blockchain.

**[Proof of Work](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work)** is roughly a method where blockchain(transactions) are verified with computing power. 

**Satoshi** is the smallest part of a bitcoin. 1 Satoshi = 0.00000001 ฿.

**[Smart contract](https://newkidsontheblockchain.nl/en/2017/10/what-is-a-smart-contract/)** See a smart contract as a set of rules that can no longer be modified because it is stored in the blockchain. A smart contract will be executed if the circumstances comply to the set of rules.

**[Wallet](https://newkidsontheblockchain.nl/en/2017/04/which-wallet-should-i-choose/)**, a digital wallet on cryptocurrency. Examples are [Jaxx](http://www.jaxx.io), [Exodus](https://www.exodus.io/) and the [Gulden Wallet](https://gulden.com/).

SOL,Altcoin,What's In Your Bag,"AltCoin preferences all depend on how you see the world of crypto evolving. I used to only be into SOL (bought at $8, held at $250, still holding - I'm a long term investor; despite their recent growing pains, there's still massive adoption and I fully believe will get back with upcoming updates) but have branched out to diversify holdings with how I see the future being built in web3. What are some of your other AltCoins and what's their elevator pitch?

My others are XRP, Polkadot, and WeGro. 

XRP 
[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/]
There's no doubt in my mind a favorable decision is coming. Despite being in litigation with the SEC, it continues to trade heavily in outside exchanges and holds a steady T10 market cap. When the decision comes, I see an absolute explosion despite the current state of the market. 

Polkadot [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/] 
DOT connects and secures specialized blockchains to facilitate cross-chain transfer of any data or asset type. This allows blockchains to be interoperable with one another to provide a foundation for web3. 

WeGro
[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wegro-coin/]
WeGro is only 7 months old and setting itself up for BIG things. It's all about decentralized participation im the CAM industry (complimentary alternative medicine). But my biggest takeaway with them is their ability to create an ecosystem of privitizing your data to sell yourself to marketing companies. Instead of big companies selling your data, you take the power back and decide what to do with it. It's some eye-opening stuff at a ground level. Their 10 min video (https://youtu.be/I9AsmCUVBok) will widen your eyes at the future of data in web3. 

[Disclaimer - I'm a social moderator for WeGro as an independent contractor but this IS NOT an advertisement. I actually believe like hell in this AltCoin and am far off from being a MoonBoi]",17,2022-06-15 23:18:29,113
SOL,Altcoin,Why I believe 8-Bit Coin will be the biggest GameFi project this year,"I really like GameFi and when I find a really good project like $COIN I just can not help myself and have to find everything about the token.

This coin project was created to level up game development on the Solana network. The goal is to on-board the next wave of web2 gamers into web3

What is interesting about this coin is its connection with Bonk. $COIN has 3 liquidity pools. SOL, USDC and Bonk. The reason for this is very simple. If you dig into all the wallets you will find out that some of the team members are huge Bonk whales with millions in $BONK.

The Dexscreener page might seem weird but this is only because $COIN is still in early stage when team members are setting everything up and preparing their project for this bullrun.

And even though they have not started with marketing yet you can see that the chart looks insane and this project will go to places.

SOL,Altcoin,"Criminally Undervalued Tech is Waking Up
","Criminally Undervalued Tech is Waking Up

The bear market has always been brutal for projects - most small ones don't make it or have cashed out and moved on leaving loyal holders with the bag.

[https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/saito](https://preview.redd.it/vonjhy9q6red1.jpg?width=1275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=805b1dedb54eb59ef2aeb0365e0a205c1e00eb55)

But the reason we keep coming back for altcoins is because that's where innovation happens, and we all know the rewards that come from taking those risks.

But choosing a good altcoin is extremely hard. Projects prey upon your lust for large returns and confuse you with technical nonsense that only sounds good.

It can be extremely hard for even experienced crypto traders to figure out much of the new tech, and if it is valuable.

With this in mind, there are two **key traits** of an altcoin that has the potential for **deep fundamental value.**

1. **Active development through the bear market**: Projects that build through the bear show strong evidence they aren't designed to scam holders - if they were, they would simply cash out and stop working.
2. **Easy to Use Apps**: Applications that are easy to get started and use show the most promise for adoption.

The only project I can think of which aces both of these key traits is Saito. And that’s not even the best part: **Saito is trading for less than memecoins.** At 12mm market cap (18mm diluted), this may be the most undervalued tech in crypto.

https://preview.redd.it/lhzfrckt6red1.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f248304da492ab69406c5c35be5544bb026c2b04

Pay attention, because Saito has started marketing in a way which has never been seen before in the project - it's clearly stirring up enthusiasm as people discover how groundbreaking Saito actually is.

And some people think this marketing push is going to include a long-awaited exchange listing.

**Fundamentals**

Saito is a unique layer-1 project supporting trustless, P2P internet. When the term ""Web3"" was invented, this was what it originally described - Saito is building true Web3, not just slapping the label onto anything with crypto.

They built all through the bear and have Web3 apps anyone (including Grandma) can use in one-click, without logging in. Routing work and ATR underlie Saito and give it some incredible capabilities for scale that are hard to explain, but worth researching.

https://preview.redd.it/31t4lpew6red1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecfa18b986e67318d3ba80ab6d1a31992120fc56

**Community**

Any community member that researches Saito deeply becomes a diehard 'Saitozen.' It is literally like taking the Red Pill from The Matrix. Once you see how Saito works, you don't look at other blockchains the same way.

Even through a brutal bear market the Saito community held strong. We helped build Red Square and polish it to a level that no P2P app has seen before - and now we don't even need Telegram.

We're the only Web3 project that actually built our community a home on the blockchain.

https://preview.redd.it/bq28tb9z6red1.jpg?width=958&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=068493e88be9809329c7a5f503bb7e93e522c260

Not only that, but we have a rich gaming community. Saito Game Engine allows classic strategy games to be played securely without a middleman, and it's attracted some of the best players of Settlers, Twilight Struggle and more.

We've also just released third-party crypto which integrates seamlessly into all the games, including multi-player P2P poker. If you've never experienced a true P2P game of poker before, it's mind-blowing how easy it is to do on Saito.

https://preview.redd.it/m9tj6ti27red1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fc7bc7d94ba163ec4a4946d74327a759fdb5e52

Everything on Saito is your public key pair. You have full ownership of all your data, accounts, interactions. And Saito makes infrastructure which supports this economically sustainable - that's the big deal!

The internet now is ran by monopolistic, predatory companies that spy on their users - Saito is the opposite. Because of this, all of the crypto ecosystem can benefit from Saito's P2P internet.

Saito community doesn't compete with other cryptos, it integrates them and offers them something they can't get anywhere else.

**Saito Summer**

Saito Summer is like a makeover for Saito - the underlying character isn't changing, but we're finally presenting Saito in a way the masses can appreciate.

So far we're only two events in, but it's already rallied the community and given a renewed sense of purpose. OGs are reinvigorated, new people are getting their minds absolutely blown by Saito and wondering how they never heard about it before.

Eth wallet integration and now P2P Livestreaming beta 'Swarmcasting' busting down the walls of what people thought was possible on crypto. Saito is not just about money, it's about a new internet and every application rollout proves that.

**Summer Burn**

Saito max supply used to be 10bn, and the extra was reserved for block rewards to make the network more secure. But now that adoption is picking up organically, they aren’t needed. Saito just burned 2bn last year, and as of this week, they burned 1bn more. The total is now 7bn tokens.

The team is committed to the community here. Holders benefit from these burns and that’s the team’s priority.

**Exchange Listing**

The Saito Team has been talking about a large CEX listing for a long time, but they have been very upfront about the predatory practices they want to avoid. Even going as far as to say that they have been offered deals by big exchanges to dump on holders, but rejected them.

The integrity of the Saito team to actually put in the extra work to only take deals that benefit holders, and not destroy them, is unheard of in most altcoins.

Some people are thinking that the exchange listing they've been talking about will come during Saito Summer, and the teasing for the next drop (this Thursday) has been secretive.

**Overall Market**

With the BTC ETF a huge success, the Ethereum ETF close by,  and potential rate cuts in the upcoming months, the timing for Saito to wake up could not be any better.",23,2024-07-26 00:04:46,8

THIS IS NOT A SHILL POST. I have witnessed the mess that leverage trading/futures trading is with the CEXes calling the shots, liquidating positions with scam wicks (yesterday BTC futures spiked to 48k while spot spiked to only 39k) and there is no DEX solution for true leverage trading with high leverage - the few DEX solutions that exist have gaping loopholes, either price is self-calculated, or leverage offered is very small, or they need you to deposit funds into their contract even if you don’t have an active trade on (example dydx)

Below are my findings about gains.farm


1. Leverage trade 21 of the most popular crypto (btc/eth/link/matic/sol/ada etc) with up to 150x leverage right from your wallet without any kyc
2. Supports limit order, stop loss, take profit just like a CEX, but fully decentralised and non-custodial
3. Unlimited liquidity - no order book
4. No funding fee, ever
5. price sourced from top 7 most liquid sources through a custom-built architecture that works with chain link and fetches data real-time with 0 lag
7. Audited 4 times by CERTIK and scores are in all time top 5
8. Operational on polygon for last 6 months - trade with nearly 0 gas cost
9. Main token $GFARM2 has reached its practical max supply at 35k
10. Token has unique burn-mint mechanism - burnt when someone loses a trade, minted when someone wins
11. Since, traders tend to lose in the long run, token is deflationary. In last 6 months, 11% of supply has been burnt
12. If you are a market maker, significant earning potential by adding liquidity to GFARM2-DAI pool in quickswap - 50% of the leverage trading platform’s income distributed to LP stakers

SOL,Altcoin,QANplatform launched the first quantum-resistant private blockchain," Today is a huge milestone for one of my biggest low-caps bags. QANplatfrom just launched a private blockchain, and by the EOY I expect a mainnet for the public blockchain too. I know what most of you are thinking. ""It's another L1 in the ocean"". Usually, I would think the same, but this has a lot to offer in comparison to some competitor chains.   Here are a few facts about why I am bullish on this blockchain: 

* This is the first quantum-resistant and EVM-compatible chain.
* It could attract many developers since they can code in any language.
* I will be a validator by using a mobile phone or Raspberry Pi.
* Partnerships for use cases are already closed.
* A great team and a huge network of partners.

 There are a lot of things going on there, and there are a lot of things you could DYOR on and thank me later!

SOL,Altcoin,What are the key things to look for/at when determining which alt content invest in?,"The link was added just so my post wouldn’t be flagged for not having one.

Just for some context:

I’m very young and can afford risk, roughly 60% of my portfolio is stock (with a fair amount of money in BITU and UPRO) and 40% is crypto. 

Within the crypto I would say 98% of my holdings are bitcoin, I have about $50 in HEGE, $25 in SOL, and $20 in ETH. I would like between 3- 5% of my entire portfolio to be in alt and meme coins.

This post is more asking about alt coins and not meme coins, as most meme coins are based off the community and luck.

But in terms of bigger alt coins, what do you guys look for when choosing to invest in these coins?? (Stocks you’d look at financials, ceo, eps, ytd performance, sector performance, competition, etc - I’m trying to see what the equivalent would be for crypto)

SOL,Altcoin,"UltraSafe: Exclusive Rubic promotion, 2 new partnerships, D.C. plus so much more","**The Story So Far**

UltraSafe, 118 days old, 300 trillion tokens burnt, Queen of BSC, Breaker of Records, Bringer of Safety, and Mother of Reflections. It has been a bullish month for UltraSafe, which has seen its market cap more than double since August 4th. For HODLers, this growth comes as no surprise, with UltraSafe now offering ULTRA-BNB LP staking, boasting the likes of Rashad Evans and Daniel Cormier as celebrity ambassadors, and having added industry professionals Zachari M. T. ‘Ƶatoshi’ Saltmer (Strategic Advisor) and Kevin Upton (Chief Technical Officer) to the team. The good news for those not yet HODLing UltraSafe is that these developments are just the beginning.

**Ƶatoshi and the Giant Peachfolio** 🍑

In early August, Ƶatoshi dropped into the UltraSafe Telegram chat to tease the community with a clue about an upcoming partnership. The image he posted was that of a safe, a single peach imposed on its door, along with the message “$ULTRA and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ coming together on the 28th! They see our potential, they know what we have coming”. Speculation ran rampant. Now, the community has its answer.

The latest project to partner with UltraSafe is Peachfolio, an APP which allows users to track every BSC token in their portfolio, add unlimited wallets and gain insights into the biggest DeFi gainers and losers. Included in their partnership with UltraSafe will be an exclusive reflections tracker, allowing HODLers to monitor how much ULTRA is being added to their wallet in real time.

**UFC’s Daniel Cormier Weighs In**

Hyped to see UltraSafe hitting milestone after milestone, UltraSafe ambassador Daniel Cormier (UFC Light Heavyweight and Heavyweight Champion) has shared his bullish sentiment on the project with his Instagram followers: “Crypto & UltraSafe are here to stay! When I joined the team, they assured me that there were big future plans in place for UltraSafe;, now I’m excited to share UltraSafe’s future plans for the ULTRA PROTOCOL. It’s gonna be its OWN ECOSYSTEM and will move out of what you guys call the ‘shitcoin’ space.” \[[Source](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTDO51uhwL9/?utm_medium=copy_link)\] Cormier also highlights an important aspect of UltraSafe’s mission when mentioning the “shitcoin space”. One of the founding principles of the project, as the developers often highlight, is that UltraSafe and other projects should provide investors with the knowledge to make informed decisions and protect themselves in the world of crypto. This is something that UltraSafe will address through the integration of an educational platform into its V4 website.

**RUBIC x ULTRASAFE**

The announcements just don’t stop in our community. This week, Rubic announced that their cross chain feature is NOW LIVE. You can now use Rubic widget to purchase Ultrasafe using ETH and MATIC, simply connect your wallet and press swap!

Rubic are also running a promotion, up until September 13th EVERYBODY who buys UltraSafe using the Rubic widget at Ultrasafe.finance gets their gas fees refunded!

**Scan DeFi**

Do you want another announcement? This week we announced our newest partner, Scan Defi. Just like us, they have taken on the immense FIGHT against scammers in Cryptocurrency as we all struggle towards the goal of making this a safer space.  

Their software allows users to obtain a full report of a project, detecting fraudulent contracts and providing education and knowledge to allow users to find these red flags for themselves. We are so excited about this awesome partnership! This just brings us even closer to our goal of changing the crypto game for the better.

I've been scouring TG, reddit and X groups, multiple charts etc to find the next 100x/1000x coin out there, and wanted to get a second opinion. I have come to a fundamentals driven conclusion;

It's now that Cat vs Dog season with exchanges such as Binance shilling this narrative at the moment, with cats poised to make a come back - my research has lead me to an OG from the previous bull market - **Dinger** \- the original cat coin.

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dinger-token/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dinger-token/)

With Meme Season pretty much upon us, this coin has taken my curiosity and I have entered the cat market. It previously has achieved 120m Market Cap with an actual team of devs actively working on to also have utility - a community coin essentially. The market cap is sitting at a humble 3 million with a few mini pumps having occurred recently.

Not trying to Shill here, but curious as to what other cat coins people are hunting, and if Dinger truly has the potential to take the prime spot. currently only a DEX coin, but if this makes it to CEX's, could it be the next BONK or Pepe? 

Dinger has seen some rallying in terms of volume so I believe there is definitely potential on this one.

Do any of the OGs remember this coin from back in the day?

SOL,Altcoin,The StrikeX Ecosystem - Due Diligence,"Hey there! Let me introduce you to StrikeX, their existing products, and all the exciting developments they have in the works.

First up, TradeStrike Lite (V1), which was the first product that was released. It's an application that allows users to stake their tokens for a variable ~10% return, with no lock-in commitment. It's a great option for current holders to benefit from staking rewards while the DEX v2 is being built from scratch. This sets it apart from other DEXs which are just carbon copies of each other. The long-awaited v2 is coming in just a few days and I can’t wait!

Security & self-custody have been all the rage in the Crypto industry lately and StrikeX have this at the forefront of their vision. Their DeFi wallet was released at the end of 2022 and supports BSC, SOL, BTC, and ETH blockchains, allowing for multi-chain support, integral swaps, portfolio & asset charting, and instant fiat deposits and withdrawals through the integration of the transak and Mercuryo payment gateways (with more on the way!). It's supported on both android and iOS and has an in-built biometric login for added security. There is a “conveyor belt” of upgrades lined up, such as NFT galleries, ledger compatibility, staking compatibility and additional network integrations, which is sure to make it the most extensive DeFi Wallet on the market.

TradeX is the fully functional V2 of their DEX, which is coming in February 2023. This new version is going to be the most comprehensive of its kind, including a fiat on-ramp, proper charting (think tradingview), order books, limit orders, and much more. You can find a demo of TradeX on StrikeX's social media platforms, but it won’t be long until you can try it out yourself!

Now, let's talk about the flagship product: TradeStrike. This is what the team set out to deliver from the beginning because of the inconvenience of traditional stock trading platforms. TradeStrike, which is due for release in 2023, will be a 24/7 trading platform that allows users to trade stocks, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, real estate, and more all in one app through the use of blockchain technology and tokenisation. All assets will be backed 1/1 with the real-world asset, and the STRX token acts as a gateway to all assets tradable on the platform. The team have been working with one of the biggest law firms on the planet, Latham & Watkins, to ensure compliance and regulation from the start. We can expect to receive a lot more information regarding this in the coming months, once all existing products are rolled out and up to date. 

Let’s not forget that while the main function of the $STRX token will be its utility within the Trading Platform, Stock Token Bridge & Blockchain, there is also 10% of the company (presumably in the form of a Tokenised asset) up for grabs to for the top 10% of holders upon launch of the trading platform. This creates a huge opportunity to get in early and be a part of the movement away from traditional finance! 

But that's not all! StrikeX is growing their web3 ecosystem and has started developing their own POA blockchain, X-Chain, with advancements in encryption standards and additional safety controls. The $STRX token will become the native currency of the network used in all transactions and gas fees.

And there's even more! StrikeX has been working on a stock token bridge that will allow for the seamless transfer of traditional stocks to tokenized versions that can be traded on the TradeStrike platform. This means users will have access to a wider range of assets, including those that are not yet tokenized, making the platform even more comprehensive. Plus, the stock token bridge will provide a new level of accessibility to traditional stock markets, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing costs associated with traditional stock trading. The bridge is still in development, and we are yet to find out the finer details, but the team is working hard to make it a game-changer in the industry.

Overall, the StrikeX ecosystem has a lot of exciting developments in the works, from their DeFi wallet and DEX to their upcoming trading platform and blockchain technology. Their focus on compliance and regulation, as well as their commitment to user security, make them a promising player in the world of cryptocurrency and finance. Keep an eye out for more!

SOL,Altcoin,Uniswap V3 Liquidity Mining: Exploring the Options,"&#x200B;

Since at least 2019, Web3 projects have been incentivizing their communities to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges. Liquidity is the lifeblood of any protocol and facilitating that liquidity in one way or another is a basic prerequisite for a successful project.

When Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap were the dominant DEXes, liquidity mining was relatively straightforward. All liquidity deposits on those exchanges are natively fungible, meaning that any deposit is directly comparable to any other one. Additionally, all liquidity deposits on those exchanges “cover” the full price range of the two assets in the pool, meaning that the AMM formula would serve up a price if token0 approached  an infinite value relative to token1 and, similarly, if token1  approached an infinite value relative to token0.

Uniswap V3 is now the dominant DEX, owing largely to its more expressive functionality. But with a richer feature-set comes greater complexity. One major casualty of Uniswap V3 is that liquidity mining now requires a profound technical expertise. Even launching an incentive on the full  price range — the most common approach to Uni V3 LM to date — still necessitates a degree of complexity.

Fear not, Web3-projects-looking-to-incentivize-Uniswap-V3-liquidity. A variety of teams are hard at work building solutions to simplify this process. Naturally, the team building xToken Terminal believes we’ve built the most secure, complete and powerful solution. However, we’ll still run through all the options that are out there in order to provide  you with the most complete set of information.

&#x200B;

[A basic summary of the feature sets for different Uniswap V3 liquidity mining options](https://preview.redd.it/5oublu58lzr81.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=38d40afd00e29e7828387a67f3cb6df31f9b1535)

## xToken Terminal

Terminal is our new capital markets platform, designed to provide DeFi/NFT projects — and whoever else! — seamless and permissionless access to fundamental on-chain primitives. The first of these primitives is Uniswap V3 liquidity mining. Via Terminal, a Web3 project can have a [Uni V3 LM program up and running in a few minutes](https://docs.xtokenterminal.io/terminal/mining/create-pool). No dev work or Uniswap expertise required.

Pool sponsors select a liquidity pool and price range to incentivize, one or more rewards token(s) to pay out to LPs and an optional vesting period on rewards. Once the liquidity/rewards pool is deployed, sponsors can initiate a rewards program for any amount over any period. Once a rewards program ends, sponsors can initialize a new one. Sponsors never need to leave the Terminal UI.

Similarly, LPs never need to leave the Terminal UI. LPs do not need to mint an NFT position (the sponsor mints a communal NFT on pool deployment) or navigate to alternative UIs to deposit liquidity pool tokens. Data on staked balances, APR, pool history, etc are all generated permissionlessly and viewable on the Terminal interface.

Terminal is available on L1, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xumnsolblzr81.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cfceac45b032711513752bc480a5ec344680bd7

## Gelato (G-Uni)

Similarly to Terminal, Gelato also provides a fungible interface for a non-fungible Uniswap V3 liquidity position. While Gelato does not actively rebalance liquidity positioning, the protocol provides a  manager role on their contracts that allows a representative of a project to actively re-position if desired.

Gelato/G-Uni does not provide any infrastructure for staking rewards, rewards  vesting or rewards data. Projects using G-Uni tokens for liquidity  mining will need to deploy/configure smart contracts and build a custom frontend.

## UniswapV3Staker

The UniswapV3Staker contract is the most “native” option available to projects looking to sponsor a liquidity mining program. The contract requires LPs to mint a Uni V3 NFT position and then deposit it. Rewards are paid out as a function of in-range liquidity, i.e. the more trading volume your position helps generate, the more rewards you will earn. This approach may be the most rooted in precision, but in practice it has been [marred by manipulation](https://medium.com/@revert_finance/onetickdao-eth-and-the-narrow-rangers-f9a376f7f0c9) as well as a bevy of UX challenges. It also requires deep Uniswap V3 knowledge to fully understand. Lastly, we’re not aware of a full-feature UI for projects that wish to use the UniswapV3Staker contract.

Some community members have proposed a few modifications to the contract — notably a change that requires LPs to cover a minimum price tick range. This change is likely to mitigate some or all of the issues related to manipulation of rewards, however, it is unlikely to allay any UX challenges.

## Charm

Charm’s Alpha vaults rely on some of the most clever Uniswap V3 liquidity management logic that can be found in the space. Charm’s vaults rebalance in a way that avoids a direct swapping of assets, instead relying on single-sided pseudo-limit orders — a Uniswap V3 hallmark.

>Sidenote: many Uni V3 liquidity managers underestimate the slippage costs and gas costs of active rebalancing strategies, thus overestimating the expected value of a rebalance. Maximizing capital efficiency at a given moment does not necessarily lead to maximization of value.

Charm is soon to release a permissionless version of their vaults (Alpha  Pro). It remains to be seen whether their approach, which is well-tested and successful on high liquidity pairs like ETH<>USDC, will be performant — programmatically or otherwise — on long tail pools.

At launch, Alpha Pro will not offer the smart contract or user interface architecture for native liquidity mining.

## Gamma

Gamma pursues a more active rebalancing strategy, relying at least partially on off-chain logic that is not transparent to LPs. Though decentralization advocates may protest, there may be something to be  said for this more obscured approach, as purely on-chain rebalance strategies may be vulnerable to front-running or other forms of value extraction. Gamma is in the midst of remodeling their approach to liquidity management, so some elements of this description may no longer be accurate.

Gamma pools are not permissionless and there is no native liquidity mining architecture.

# A Note on Rebalancing

We at xToken have been demo-ing our new platform for a variety of projects in the space. We’ve been excited by the positive feedback we’ve received on the platform’s ease-of-use, configurability and  extensibility.

Several projects have asked us why we don’t offer the ability to rebalance  positioning in a pool. As the product currently operates, pool sponsors must set a price range at deployment and are unable to modify that price range (although deploying a new pool with new price range takes only a few minutes). While we are exploring methods of introducing this functionality, we believe that offering a rebalance feature on a permissionless platform like ours could expose our users to frontrunning and other forms of value extraction.

Why is that? We have experience with Uni V3 repositioning from our time managing [xU3LP](https://medium.com/xtoken/introducing-xu3lp-fungible-yield-f151c747131b), which for several months, was the largest provider of managed Uniswap V3 liquidity. It turns out that rebalancing must be executed very carefully, especially when the position in question is responsible for the lion’s share of liquidity on the Uniswap pair (this concentration of pool ownership is likely the case for many LM programs). In carefully researching management strategies for xU3LP, we witnessed many instances of LP rebalances being front-run by bots on-chain. In short, rebalancing large Uniswap V3 positions requires a level of expertise and sophistication uncommon in the space.

Blockchain is revolutionizing the food supply chain. It makes it possible to know exactly where and how your food is grown. Regulators can keep track of important quality details such as listing fruit and vegetables as organic, and preventing fraudulent claims that in the past could have slipped through the cracks during distribution. It also makes it possible for grocers to easily pull the supply from shelves if a known provider discovers problems such as contamination, making it much easier to prevent disasters. Additionally, blockchain allows suppliers to keep track of the supply levels everywhere food is sent to avoid waste...

SOL,Altcoin,Zuna launches Zunaverse.io 4/23,"***Zuna***

Zuna is a hyper deflationary token built on Binance's Smart Chain network. Every decentralized transaction creates a burn, reflection, and liquidity.  This provides liquidity to keep Zuna stable, adds coin to your personal bag, and effectively removes Zuna from circulation.  Zuna is also approaching their next milestone burn, 10% of all Zuna will be burnt for this event.

Total supply is 1Q. Over 30% has already been burned. The next burn will make it over 40%...All dex buys, sells, and transfers are taxed 10%. Half of the fee, or 5% of the transaction goes to the liquidity pool. The other half is used for reflections. Divided amongst all holders based on the amount of Zuna owned but here is the cool part, the burn wallet counts as a holder. Sucking up more and more Zuna over time. The larger the burn wallet gets, the more is burned with each transaction. 

[***Zunaverse.io***](https://Zunaverse.io) 

[Zunaverse.io](https://Zunaverse.io) is Zuna's NFT marketplace, beta launching 4/23. Much like opensea but better, built on smart chain, BNB being the main currency for transactions so the mint and gas fees are minimal compared to eth. Faster transactions and will have lazy minting worked in to allow creators to list entire collections without having to pay a minting fee until sell. Transacting in $Zuna will unlock special features such as having your collection featured on Zunaverse.io.  It's going live Saturday and although a few functions, like lazy minting and the $Zuna auto buy system still need to be built, I'm excited to see the progress as the devs continue working and NFT creators from around the world come flooding into the Zunaverse.

***ZunaNauts***

1969 ZunaNauts, Zuna's exclusive set of NFTs to kick off the launch of [Zunaverse.io](https://Zunaverse.io) giving holders partial ownership of the entire marketplace. 6 tiers all paying their own percentage of marketplace volume. If you've looked into NFT marketplace volume, you know this is massive. When the auto buy feature is added 2.5% of all marketplace volume will be used to auto buy $Zuna. this Zuna is sent to a reward pool, the reward pool will be divided between all NFT's staked on [Zunaverse.io](https://Zunaverse.io). In the meantime, devs have said they will air drop the coins to ZunaNaut holders who have staked on [Zunaverse.io](https://Zunaverse.io).  This will be a fair launch, no whitelist. [Zunaverse.io](https://Zunaverse.io) goes live to the public on 4/23. To get early access to ZunaNauts and the marketplace join one of Zuna's Telegram or Discord groups.

SOL,Altcoin,Meqa Network - Bitcoin Solar Mining,"Bitcoin Mining has been around since its inception of Bitcoin in 2009. As a Proof of Work blockchain, mining has always been a major process for Bitcoin, one that has also been a major environmental detriment. According to the Cambridge Electricity Consumption Index, the amount of electricity utilized for off-grid Bitcoin is estimated to be 142.17 TWh (Terrawatt-hours) of annual consumption. The power required for such an operation has always been nothing less than enormous. 

Recently- a Bitcoin infrastructure company, Blockstream, and digital payment company Block Inc. have confirmed that they will be constructing an off-grid solar-powered Bitcoin mining facility in Texas.

And I still have not broke even. Noooo - I don't count backwards, doh! It's how I count and how my mind works. I know exactly how much fiat has moved out of my bank account into the land of hopium, and I know my goal is to move back as much fiat as I can. So this is how I count shit ... what's gone in compared to what's been pulled out.

I've only been into 2 tokens during my short time in crypto. SHIB and RBIF. I bought into the hype of SHIB and learned (pretty quickly) the meaning of FOMO, buying high, and selling low. After watching the steady decline of my SHIB I thought fuck it and jumped into RBIF during the first few days of Jan 22. Timing was just good luck bought on by a soft shill. I count myself as being a holder number between 1000 - 1200 or thereabouts. Dunno exactly because it was all a blur and I was still freaking out intensely by all the hoops you had to jump through back then and all the scare stories of being hacked while doing it.

Thanks to bank statements I know how much I've spent overall and what number past nine zero's needs to be reached for me to say (truthfully) Ahh ... I've fucking broken even - now I'm making!!!

SOL,Altcoin,Why is $CATHEON is going to make me a millionaire? (DD included DYOR),"After seeing this token pop up on my Twitter multiple times over the last few days I wanted to share this buy-of-the-century opportunity in the blockchain gaming space. SolChicks (first high quality game on Solana) has just announced a rebrand of their single game token to a gaming ecosystem token across 25 games + Steam platform + metaverse project called Catheon Gaming.

The business model is similar to other gaming ecosystems such as Gala, WEMIX and Immutable X with a portfolio of high quality games, and a high degree of vertical integration (ranging from game development to distribution and SDK). Compared to its competitors Catheon is more focused on a publisher / advisory model to convert successful Web2 games to Web3, and has the highest number of quality games among its peers.

While similar gaming ecosystem tokens all trade around \~$1.5 billion fully diluted market capitalization, **SolChicks token (**[**https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solchicks-token/markets/**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solchicks-token/markets/)**) is only $45M now (only \~3% of the price of the competitors), due to temporary mispricing as a single game token, but will be swapped 1 for 1 for Catheon token if it is bought before their snapshot at 1PM UTC on 13 Oct 2022.** With the largest game portfolio and one of the biggest communities (in terms of Twitter following and existing token holders), there’s no way the Catheon token is valued lower than its peers. Already up \~300% in the last few days. You can check out the details yourself on their website, what do you think?  


EDIT: Just noticed Cointelegraph featured them just a couple days ago [here](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/catheon-gaming-announces-the-catheon-gaming-ecosystem).

# Frequently Asked Questions about $KROM

**What are KROM Tokenomics?**

100M KROM tokens in existence. No rebasing, no burns.

60M (60%) available on Uniswap. This amount is forever locked on the Uniswap protocol since the original Uniswap LP token is burned.

20M (20%) is used to provide Layer 2 liquidity on Arbitrum and Optimism (10M each)

20M (20%) added on Gnosis, a multi-signature wallet.

**Is KROM token a utility token?**

Yes! KROM token is a utility token and it is used as a fee token for Kromatika DEX swaps.

**How to use Kromatika DEX?**

After connecting your MetaMask wallet and you have some KROM in your address you are ready to go. The swap interface is as straightforward as swapping on Uniswap, but with our added limit order field. Use this to set your limit orders for your trades and click SWAP. When the market has the conditions for your trades, Kromatika DEX will execute your trades automatically. You need to come back and manually claim your swaps. When there are multiple swaps to claim, you can use the batch feature to get them all in one transaction.

**How to buy KROM token on Arbitrum?**

First, you have to send ETH to the Arbitrum network (L2). You can do this using a centralized exchange like Binance that supports Arbitrum network transactions. Alternately you can use an ETH bridge Synapse to convert your ETH from the main et to Arbitrum network. After you have made the switch, you can use Uniswap to swap your Arbitrum ETH for the KROM token.

**How does Kromatika DEX swaps work?**

In the background, Kromatika always needs a fixed fee in ETH. This fixed fee is the actual gas cost of the trade processor (ChainLink Keepers) and it is dependant on the current gas fee. The user of Kromatika Swap can override this gas price and specify the gas price at which they want their trades to be executed. This in turn delays the trade execution a bit for the sake of lowering this fixed service fee. The user always pays this fee with KROM tokens.

**Is the KROM token code audited?**

Yes! KROM token is a non-mintable ERC 20 token audited by OpenZeppelin and MythX.

**Do I have to own a KROM token to use Kromatika DEX?**

Yes! Kromatika DEX always uses KROM tokens to settle the transaction fee.

**What is the KROM lifecycle loop?**

When a trade is processed KROM is deducted from the user’s balance on the App and sold on the market for ETH which in turn is sent to the trade processor (Chain Link Keepers) to cover the gas cost. In this way KROM token circulates in a loop: Uniswap -> User -> Kromatika DEX -> Uniswap.

**Is Kromatika code open-source?**

Yes! All the code is open-sourced and published on GitHub under the MIT license. Anybody can see how it was developed, built and who has contributed with code over time. We also welcome open-source contributors.

**What wallets does Kromatika DEX support?**

Currently, the user can access the App using MetaMask. More wallet integrations will follow up in the future.

SOL,Altcoin,Turning 50€ of monthly spendings into a monthly crypto DCA with the Plutus Crypto Card,"**WHAT IS PLUTUS**

PLUTUS is a project on the Ethereum Blockchain that offers a non custodial platform with a crypto card. Due to its non custodial nature you run no risk of losing funds and are in full control of your holdings at all times, no lock ups and no trickery. You connect your account to Metamask and thats it, easy. I personally connected via Metamask with my Ledger.

**DUE DILLIGENCE**

Before i delve into the Rewards i thought a DD is of order. My opinion is very biased im a holder as well as a believer of this project.

***MarketCap:*** The low market cap is a double edged sword. A project of this low MC has a high risk ratio but at the same time this means high reward once the project succeeds.

***Long Term Survival:*** With rewards 2.0 PLUTUS as a project and company will be having a monthly revenue stream that is sustainable. The tokenomics of PLUTUS have been developed with the usecase in mind and a long term outlook.

***Non Custodial:*** Hodl your PLU safely on your own wallet of choice. This also means that if the code of PLUTUS has a bug and is hackable your own funds are safe and the impact on the project will be minimised (price wise) as staking does not take place in a centralised manner.

***Availability:*** The product (crypto card) is only available in Europe and the UK at the moment. During a recent AMA there were talks about expansions into South America next and the rest of the world.

***User Interface:*** PLUTUS has both a desktop version and an App. I use both, but i find the desktop version a bit messy, as in you sometimes have to look quite some time to find something. On the app it is much simpler and the UI is improved.

***REWARDS 2.0***

The new Rewards are a fantastic way to DCA money that you would otherwise just spend and never see again. Let me explain.

When utilizing this programme you get 20 perks to choose from:

10€ Rebate per month (or rebate in the base subscription fee) for any of the following :

[The number of perks you can choose depends on the subscription you choose and whether you stake PLU or not.](https://preview.redd.it/p3r4gje07zq81.png?width=2297&format=png&auto=webp&s=02270864403c4f0d424a2425fd6401a6fac937d4)

**Subscriptions**: 

[3 Monthly subscriptions to choose from, this is mandatory](https://preview.redd.it/9mvpmit27zq81.png?width=2023&format=png&auto=webp&s=f09135c45a9e64c969ad6d0b7007e06ec9777436)

With subscription alone you can reach the following maximum earnings per category:

**1)Starter,** 3% cashback on up to 250€/mo spend  so 7.5€ a month cashback & 1 perk of choice.

***Max earnings 17.5€***

**2) Everyday,** 3% on up to 2000€/mo so 60€ a month cashback & 2 perks of choice.

***Max earnings 80€***

**3) Premium,** 3% on up to 22,500€ so 675€ a month cashback. 3 perks of choice.

***Max earning 750€***

Furthermore we have **Staking requirements**, this is optional

&#x200B;

[Note: the cashback &#37; from perks is not added to the subscription but it replaces the standard 3&#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/t0mccv757zq81.png?width=2071&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f70ef60245a9656382247767eab11c7c4adf5ab)

So how do i make more than 50€ a month in cashbacks?

Currently im getting cashback from Netflix, my go to supermarkets Aldi and Lidl as well as justeats where i order food once or twice a month.

I havent changed my habits i simply added PLUTUS to my life, with an ""everyday"" subscription and the initial staking level called "" Hero"" . 

Now i automatically DCA between  40€ a month due to the 4 perks and my cashbacks can go up to 80€ if i spend the full amount of 2000€

Certainly 50€ a month is retrieved from thin air per month and automatically invested.

SOL,Altcoin,Syscoin Smart Contract Public Testnet Is Live! ⚡,"&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/tsf9owdntbq71.gif

Today is a *huge* day for crypto — the [Syscoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/syscoin/) Smart Contract Public Testnet is now live (yes, that's right — it's not a mythical whitepaper — it's a *living, breathing smart contract beast* waiting for you!) You can now build *whatever app you want* on top of the most innovative network in crypto!

## Sounds Cool, But Why Would I Build On Syscoin (Shouldn't I Just Build It On ETH or SOL)?

Well, to name just a few:

* Any app you can build on Ethereum can be built on Syscoin (DeFi? DEX? Other Dapps starting in D? You name it — you can build it here!) 🏗️
* The code is open-sourced — Syscoin has nothing to hide! 👀
* The Syscoin network has been audited by third party industry leaders (for both speed and security!) ✅
* Speaking of, Syscoin is ultra-secure (it's actually merge-mined with bitcoin — giving it the **second highest hash rate** of any crypto coin in the universe!) 🔒
* Did I mention its scalability was designed to accommodate ""smart cities""? 🏙️
* The Syscoin network is nimble and will power the NFT innovations for years to come (fractional / divisible NFTs, royalties, auctions, the [Luxy.io](http://luxy.io/) marketplace ...) 🖼️
* Want to make a serious stablecoin (or a silly meme-coin?) You can mint those for super cheap on Syscoin. 🪙
* The complementary Chrome-extension [PaliWallet](https://twitter.com/PaliWallet) will hit the Chrome app store on October 5th (one wallet for all of your SYS, BTC, ETH, MATIC / Polygon & Web3 needs!) 💻
* This team has a track record of delivering the goods since 2014 (true OGs!) 💪

SOL,Altcoin,"I don't believe that every opportunity is a rip-off; in fact, some of them have the potential to make you quite wealthy.","Many crypto fans have been opposed to investing in meme currencies since they first surfaced in the crypto realm. Analysts cautioned that investing in meme tokens is not always a safe bet. Many people, I was informed, would bet on these coins in the hopes of choosing the next Doge or Shiba, and many of them would be burned. That may be true, but there are more opportunities to invest in and get wealthy now than there have ever been. You may make money by investing in the stock market, real estate, or cryptocurrencies, but in 2021, the most interesting alternative was to invest in Shiba Inu, Doge, or [Mononoke Inu](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mononoke-inu/) meme coins. They demonstrated last year that there was plenty of opportunity for expansion. 

  
Industry representatives stressed the importance of caution when choosing which tokens to invest in and avoiding scams such as ""rug pulls,"" which refers to scenarios in which developers abandon a project and walk away with investors' funds. Finding the right meme currency to invest in is getting harder, but the more the risk, the larger the potential reward. What are your opinions on this, and do you plan to invest in a meme currency in 2022?",0,2022-01-26 20:30:22,17

SOL,Altcoin,Solana altcoin upside MNDE?,"I've been looking for some Solana ecosystem altcoin investments. I'm bullish with all the stuff happening with NFTs (that you can actually afford the gas) and the sol DeFi is growing like crazy. The coins in this ecosystem seem to have underperformed over the last year but with Coinbase beginning now integreating spl tokens maybe the smallcaps have some upside?

I just saw this [post on Medium](https://medium.com/marinade-finance/a-glimpse-towards-the-end-of-2022-8fa680aeafc9) about Marinade planning more utility for their mnde token. . If it's true they are working to decentralize solana then maybe whales will feel like they should be part of this. The marketcap is $10 million on coingecko. I've never bought a token that small (lowest has been $70 million with MC). The chart is pretty flat recently and maybe it's bottomed out. Solana Alt Summer 2022? idk

SOL,Altcoin,[ANN]Pillar - The Personal Data Locker - 60hr Token sale begins July 15,"**PILLAR PROJECT**
___
For those who want the details, please read the [**Pillar Gray Paper**](https://pillarproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/PillarProjectGrayPaper.pdf). Here is a short version:
___
The European Commission’s [*Fire Study of Next Generation Internet*](https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/the-fire-study-ngi-white-paper-survey-results_01.pdf) recently concluded that ...
___
- **Internet should ensure citizens' sovereignty over their own data and protect privacy;**

- **Internet should ensure diversity, pluralism and a right to choose; and**

- **Internet should avoid the concentration of data in a few proprietary platforms.**

- **Personal Data Spaces was seen as a very important technology area for all the above top ranked values.**
___
These are the problems the Pillar project will address. We want to give people a better, safer dashboard to their digital world, starting with an open-source wallet. We have two main objectives:
___
**Replace accounts with atomic ownership**. We all have dozens of accounts. With accounts, you log in and all your valuable data is trapped inside the app or the service. This presents huge concentration risk. By switching from accounts to wallets, each person owns his/her own assets and can switch vendors freely.
___
**Replace apps with services**. Apps on our phones are miniature desktop apps. This harkens back to the days of paper-based processes, showing once again that humans always adopt the old ways of working to new technology. Now that we all have superconnected computers in our pockets, we believe the personal data locker will replace iOS and Android to become the operating system for all your devices.
___
The decentralization movement and technologies like blockchain will lead to a fundamental reversal of power, putting people in control of their digital lives.
___

**The Pillar Wallet**
___
Having waited patiently for 15 years, we believe the moment is here now. We will start by building the world’s best cryptocurrency and token wallet. We will focus on the user experience - to make it as easy as possible to set up and use a wallet. There are a few excellent wallets - we have our work cut out for us. But since our target is to build a dashboard for your digital life, our wallet will be different. Our wallet will be mobile first. It will include a browser, and we hope to include one or more exchanges. We want the experience to be as easy as possible. We’ll be targeting specific use cases and personas and working to make their experience as familiar and powerful as possible. Almost everyone is a beginner. Almost everyone finds managing private keys challenging. Almost everyone doesn’t appreciate the complexity behind wallets and exchanges and smart contracts. This is our mission - to simplify, build a strong foundation, and keep adding what our customers want next.
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl2aNk72TUc
___
**The Pillar Ecosystem**
___
Pillar is far more than a wallet, a browser, and an exchange. Pillar brings to life the concepts in David Siegel’s book, *Pull*. As David explains, apps are a huge waste of resources and prevent innovation. Apps have to be maintained on half a dozen platforms - more than 50% of every app is just infrastructure related to presenting content and offers. What really matters are content, connections, and commerce, and being able to mix them as you like. The Pillar wallet will let you sort, filter, compare, mix, and match these things to suit your needs. This represents the convergence of the semantic web and the web of value.

As an example, think of attending a conference in a city far away. To do this on your phone you’ll need a dozen apps that don’t talk to each other, and you’ll sign contracts for air, rail, car, hotel, tours, shows, excursions, currency exchange, babysitting, restaurants, conference registration, scheduling, events, meetings, and more. At best, each of these has its own app, and probably its own reward point system. Now try to manage all the expenses and record keeping - more apps. Do the apps talk to each other? In general, they don’t.

The pillar ecosystem will create a new ecosystem of data, content, and commerce. We’re almost there - we have the standards, formats, and APIs to do much of what we want. It’s our job to bring these together to create a customer experience that is many times more compelling than using apps. In general, you’ll ask a question or say what you’re looking for, and the content, data, and transactions will come to you. We believe the wallet will be the center of your digital life, and it will pull everything you want when you want it, in a way that's more natural than apps.

___
**The Personal Data Locker**
___
The concept of [the personal data locker](https://medium.com/@pullnews/lets-crowdfix-the-data-problem-permanently-4acfe2c833a9) comes from David's book, *Pull*. We have seen many such projects come and go. Much of it comes down to trust - people don’t trust institutions, advertisers, or third parties to manage their data. This is why Microsoft and Google projects have failed.

We understand that consumers don’t want to manage their own data. There’s a detailed section of the gray paper that goes into consumer reluctance and how to find our early adopters. Right now, we have a chance - to create the world’s best wallet, integrate it into many systems, and let it lead to the personal assistant that “magically” helps you manage your life. See this early video from 2010 that shows the use cases for the project: 
___
https://vimeo.com/14061238
___
**The Pillar Token**
___
While the wallet and platform are open-source and free, users will pay for the various PDL services with pillar tokens as they use them. The token will power (provide micropayments for) the entire ecosystem, giving an instant business model to many projects that can tie in. This is the beauty of the token: you may need a service exactly once and you won’t need to sign up for it, you’ll just pay for it with a Pillar token and you’re done.

Here’s an example: you go see your doctor, she does some tests and gives you a prescription for some pills. All the data from that visit, and the prescription, will be copied to your wallet. You can then manage the prescription any way you like, including asking for bids from pharmacies for the lowest price, or fastest delivery, etc. In this case, pharmacies compete for your order, and their software can be aware what the bid/ask is, and they may give you special offers to choose their service or even pay you to watch an ad for a particular drug. This is all under your control - you decide how you want it, and you pay a small number of pillars each time you use the system for storing your records and letting you manage your relationship with the health-care system. Your data can even go to a study being done - with your permission - and even though you’re anonymous in the study, if they want to send you a message, you’ll have a choice of receiving it or not.

The pillar is a meta-token. For example, Brave has a native token for seeing customized ads and monetizing your browsing experience. Augur has a token for betting. Akasha has one for messaging. You'll encounter dozens or hundreds of tokens as you go about your day. All these tokens will be native in our system one level below the Pillar token. Users may only ever see pillars, or they may see the various utility tokens for the services they use.

We are market driven. We do experiments and look for opportunities.

We need the resources to go after several different market segments:

- Crypto-enthusiasts
- Early-adopter tech enthusiasts

___
We are already strong in business development and will get stronger. Eventually, we want our wallet not to be another app on your phone, but to be the software that runs your phone. We will need partners, industry veterans, strong marketers, excellent communications team, and more.

And we’ll need a great product. We are starting from scratch. We’re planning to hire in August and September, and we want you to be part of it. People who understand our mission and support us by buying our tokens, even if only a few, are the people we want to hire.

Anyone who comes to Poprad in early August is probably a person we want to hire. Every morning, we will have blockchain learning and Pillar planning sessions. We will have tracks for central services, communications, product, and marketing. If you are reading this, you are welcome to join us (we're not paying expenses, sorry, but we are paying for the meeting rooms and a big dinner on Friday night).

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Sharing my old solana bundle.,"Greetings, fellow crypto aficionados!  
  
Reading your posts gave me the urge to tell you about my old bundle which was one of my first bundles which I discovered much time ago. Sit tight as I dissect my strategic, devoid of embellishment but rich in substance.  
  
To test it out, I decided to deposit $3150 into Solana, I initiated a seamless transition to USDT, witnessing a commendable upsurge to $3469.  
  
I also used different tactics – from the patient 'HODL' stance to strategic liquidations for real-world acquisitions. Because prudent fiscal management remains paramount amidst the allure of crypto's allure.  
  
Presently,I have 10,000$ on my balance and my focus pivots towards opportune timings, awaiting the ascent of ligament percentages. Patience, after all, is the cornerstone of prudent arbitrage.  
  
Why divulge this narrative, you ask? Beyond the facade of self-aggrandizement lies an earnest desire to embolden fellow enthusiasts. Let us convene, to share insights and fortify our collective understanding of the crypto domain.  
  
What methodologies do you employ in your arbitrage endeavors? What binders anchor your strategies amidst the volatile tides of crypto? Let us unravel the complexities together, forging a community steeped in knowledge and camaraderie.  
  
Also below are screenshots of my way.  
  
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/59N0uCG)

  
P.S. Right now this bundle still works, and despite the fact that the profit percent in this bundle is not so much, the main advantages are that you don't need to go through KYC to scroll. On the exchange it is written that verification is required only for deposits over 400SOL. idk if it's true, but deposits from 50-100sol pass through without any verification. I rarely use this bundle in cause I already discovered a new one with a bigger profit so idc about sharing it. If I'll find smth better then my current one, I will also share it with you. Also, I would be reallly pleased if you could tell me about your approaches and experience in this world of arbitrage. :3",1,2024-04-04 01:26:03,0

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,What we should expect from Solana in 2023?,"We are all aware that the failure of FTX and Alameda Research had a particularly negative impact on the capitalization of the cryptocurrency, and the Solana investor is also aware of this.   


But are programmers avoiding cryptocurrency as well?  


I've heard that in 2022, the number of active developers of Solana's software fell by more than 90%.  


Sam Bankman-Fried was able to injure the altcoin more than the network outages that the cryptocurrency has had over the past two years since he was a big proponent of Solana.  


Solana is well known for being a key player in NFTs. In fact, behind Ethereum, it has the second-largest market in this sector. Additionally, one of the most well-known markets for NFTs is the altcoin market.  


Even though I was a major fan of SOL, I want to focus more on projects like Coin Fantasy and like ones in the upcoming year because you never know which one might catch on.  


The SOL network's creators were a crucial source of assistance. After the Bitcoin meltdown, they continued to run their business, and it is currently unknown if they are still doing so more than a month after FTX declared bankruptcy.",10,2022-12-27 17:35:44,3

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Solana's price soars as a whale move half a million tokens,"I'm happy to see that the market is trading in green today as Bitcoin and other Altcoins are still seeing a jump today despite the collapse of three major U.S. banks last week.   
 

I've read that significant amounts of SOL and MATIC tokens were transferred between various wallets. According to blockchain data, an unknown wallet transferred 537,352 SOL tokens worth 10,743,976 USD to Coinbase, a popular crypto exchange.   
 

Another notable transfer occurred when 11,983,053 MATIC tokens worth 14,104,719 USD were sent from Polygon to an unknown wallet.   
 

In a separate transaction, two unknown wallets transferred a massive amount of MATIC tokens to Binance, another prominent crypto exchange. The first wallet transferred 30,000,000 MATIC tokens, equivalent to 35,330,121 USD, while the second wallet transferred 30,000,000 MATIC tokens, worth 35,388,676 USD.   
 

I must track these events and prices on Toshi Tools since Solana's price soars by 13.26% in the last 24 hours and each SOL token is trading for 21.82 USD.    
 

The market cap for this crypto is currently at 8.35 billion USD. Trading volume is up by 22.52% over the last day. Solana has seen a rise of 4.29% in the last 30 days, trading as high as $26.93. Over the past 7 days, the token has seen a growth of 8.00%",8,2023-03-15 19:31:49,0
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Will Solana's price continue to surge after the explosive price rally?,"What do you make of the most recent report that Solana's price has increased by 45% in the past week?  


I'm expecting to hear more good news since I believe that this year will be the year of recovery of the crypto market, I've already found some great platforms and projects, and CoinFantasy is probably one of them on which I plan to spend most of the time.  


When it comes to SOL, after reaching an annual low of $8 in December, the coin had this notable comeback. The coin lost 1.6% over the past day, showing that SOL was consolidating following a period of explosive rallying.  


Major cryptocurrencies also observed northbound price activity as Bitcoin continued to rebound. The coin's technical outlook has also shown that bullish strength is growing on the chart. The coin has experienced significant accumulation, and during the past week, demand has skyrocketed.  


The altcoin was currently inside the overbought zone, which indicates that buyers have entirely taken over the market. A coin typically experiences a correction following a rally, and the price of Solana may be doing the same.

$HOPE is a no-bullshit impact token designed to build a global community around the cause of true wealth creation by disrupting the highest risk factors for mental health crises.

**Why impact token and not charity?**

Because $HOPE doesn't just plan to donate money to causes. It plans to build an actual global, decentralized community (Hope Force) that can dent the mental health universe.   A community with aligned incentives where we can all share in a growing movement's personal and economic benefits. Every **$HOPE** transaction will fuel the training of one more Ally or the funding of a Partner Organization’s critical program. They call this perpetual cycle; **Hope-Nomics**

**🔆 Tokenomics: 🔆**

**$HOPE’S** unique tokenomics were designed by a world-class economis to minimize the Ponzi attributes of most meme coins.

💗 TOTAL SUPPLY: 1 Quadrillion (On Ethereum Chain) + 1 Quadrillion (On Polygon Chain)+ 1 Quadrillion (On Solana Chain)

💗 Upon launch, 33% of the supply will be permanently locked in the Treasury (i.e., the Blackhole), and 33% of all $HOPE tokens will be locked in the reward pool.

💗 Transaction Tax: 5%

Beyond its altruistic mission, $HOPE's ultrasound money protocol principles make it truly one-of-a-kind.. By bridging the leading DeFi blockchains, $HOPE is on a self-perpetuating path towards more Users and Total Value Locked (TVL).

**CORE PRINCIPLES**

* **Progressive Decentralization**
* **Ultra Sound Money (Store Of Value)**
* **Legitimacy**
* **Community Impact**

As always, check on their extensive site and litepaper and do your own due diligence. But with the ERC-20 token Unicrypt pre-sale scheduled for September 1, just know you are potentially on the ground floor of something special.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Solana Increased by 13.33%, Will it Keep Increasing?","
Over the last day, Solana (SOL) was able to keep up well above the $30.69 support level and showed a reversal sign to come back. As shown in CoinMarketCap, Solana hovers at $37.19, with a 2.41% rise in the past 24 hours with a trading volume of $1,177,991,580.15, dropping by 27.14%.

News from CoinQuora indicated that looking at the daily chart of SOL/USDT, SOL is forming a rising flag pattern in the bearish market starting from May 12, 2022. The support zone of SOL lies around $20 – $30. SOL turned out to be in a side-way market for 24 days ever since it dropped to the support zone, and eventually, it started gradually making a reversal like other blockchain tokens like Concordium(CCD), Tezos(XTZ) and Fantom(FTM).

According to CoinMarketCap, SOL has 1.39% of the current market and has the rank of 9. Within a week, SOL swings from $31.06  to $37.48. The support level of $20 – $30 can make or break the situation for SOL bulls. Is any of the SOL buyers here involved in putting a buying block at $33.77?

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Do you really think that Solana can compete with Ethereum?,"What are your thoughts on the possibility of Solana colliding with Ethereum? That was a comment made by Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, that I read about today.  


People referred to Solana as the ""Ethereum killer"" when it was first introduced.  


It rose to prominence as a reactive blockchain that filled gaps in the Ethereum blockchain. With a transaction pace of around 60000 per second, Solana is one of the fastest layer-one blockchains. It is a far more efficient, highly scalable, and low-fee blockchain that is currently in its early stages.  


Do you really think that Solana can compete with Ethereum?  


In comparison, Ethereum not only has a larger NFT marketplace than Solana, but it is also the flagship altcoin and the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. It stands out in terms of decentralization and is backed by the extremely efficient Ethereum Foundation. It enables multi-chain networks, which dramatically enhances scalability while minimizing security risks.  


I'd want to learn more about blockchain and this stuff, I've been doing my own study on the differences between Solana and Ethereum, but I'm hoping to get more information on the AIBC conference in August in Belgrade, Serbia.  


This year, the blockchain will launch its hard split known as the Merge. Many people in the Ethereum community have high hopes for it.",1,2022-08-01 23:05:53,2
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Why Has Solana Fallen? Possible Reasons,"There is nothing new in the crashing crypto market, but still, there are always projects and platforms that are more interesting than others. Solana is definitely the case. That’s because it’s one of the fastest blockchains in the industry. The current Ethereum proof-of-work model is low scalable, it can only process 15 TPS. On the contrary, Solana is thousands of times faster than Ethereum. The issue is that Solana’s price has fallen for approximately 6 months, and that’s interesting to find out possible reasons for such a significant drawback. Here’s what we think about the following topic.  


**3 Main Reasons for Solana's Price Drop**  
First, the situation with the growing index of the USA retail prices and increase of the FRS rate could be a reason.

At the end of the last week, there was a new announcement of the USA inflation +8.6%, a record-breaking index since 1981. The FRS forcibly increased the rate and cut liquidity. The US stock market officially entered the downtrend. The following circumstances indicate severe pressure upon the crypto market.

Then, the Solana network experienced about 9 failures in less than a year.  


The failure occurred from 30 April to 1 May, when the network was ‘frozen.’ The problem appeared because numerous incoming transactions and excessive traffic overloaded the network and caused the complete letup. According to the developers, a massive amount of transactions resulted from refusal from the Dutch Auction system when minting NFTs. Thus, NFT buyers tried to maximize their chances of sending a massive number of requests. Consequently, the validators lacked memory, and the collapse happened. Because of the issue, Solana lost 11.3%.  
Next, on 1 June, Solana wasn't generating new blocks for 4 hours because of the failure in 'long-term unremarked transactions' processing that led to blockchain consensus damage. The developers switched the operation off and asked the validators to relaunch the blockchain. As a result of the failure, Solana lost 12%.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Is Ethereum 2.0 going to chase Solana, BSC, and other blockchain networks home?","Yes, we are all aware of the numerous restrictions that now afflict our beloved Ethereum network.  


Major limitations include extremely high gas fees for even simple transactions, a transaction per second (TPS) figure of around 15, which makes the network slow when it comes to processing transactions, and a couple of other limitations like the current consensus model in use and the technicality of its programming language, even for developers.  


With so many gaps in the Ethereum network layer, great networks like Solana, Polygon, certain NFT communities like High Sloth Society, and many more have risen to dominate the blockchain industry.  


But we all know Ethereum isn't sleeping on its flaws with its Ethereum 2.0 aspirations.  


Looking into the crystal ball, what do you think of the numerous currently existing blockchain networks when Ethereum 2.0 eventually emerges from the pipeline in full force?  


With Ethereum 2.0 rumored to run on a Proof-of-Stake consensus architecture, Sharding implemented on the network, and a TPS of roughly 150,000... Do you believe all of these other networks would still have a seat?  


When Eth 2.0 goes live, what does your crystal ball say about Solana, Polygon, HSS, and others?",1,2022-05-15 19:21:28,3
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and Cardano (ADA) Lead Altcoins Charge As 2021 Closes Its Curtains","[https://btcmanager.com/solana-sol-polkadot-dot-cardano-ada-altcoin-2021/](https://btcmanager.com/solana-sol-polkadot-dot-cardano-ada-altcoin-2021/)

Solana (SOL) has recorded high entries from its developers lately, surpassing the submission rates of [DOT](https://btcmanager.com/will-polkadot-and-huh-token-become-the-favourite-altcoins/) and ADA on Github. Per data from Santiment, Solana has had about 97 development entries on Github today. Cardano and Polkadot closely follow Solana in the year-end development activity analysis.

**Altcoins Increase Their Development Entries**

Per an analysis from crypto data tracker Santiment, Solana, Cardano, Polkadot, Ethereum, and Chainlink have recorded a lot of development activities lately. Solana has had quite a run this year, which saw it breaching its ATH and rank among the top 10 cryptos. 

The Q4 of 2021 started with meager daily development activities in the large-cap coins. On OCT. 29, 2021, almost all top 10 coins had less than ten development activities. Their development teams started incorporating new technologies, and the daily submission rates crawled back to normal. These developments are a good signal heading to the next year as some of the altcoins networks’ activities signal the crypto market’s anticipation for 2022.

**Solana Eclipses Daily Development Activities of Other Large Cap Cryptos**

In June 2021, Polkadot and Cardano had very high Github development submission rates. Both of these coins had more than 60 daily entries each. At the same time, Solana only had fewer than 50 daily entries. The two coins maintained the lead in daily development submissions on the github, while major cryptos had little to no activities in matters development. Nonetheless, the other digital currencies started registering a spike in their daily submission rates in Mid-August.

The daily developments were reduced by August but resumed vigorously in September. The whole of September was a busy month for developers as the daily submission rates for most coins were very high. At this time, ETH, DOT, and [ADA](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl) were the leader as SOL followed closely behind. It was not till towards Mid-October that the daily developments reduced.

After the number of development submissions on Github started rising in November, the Solana team began dominating. Their submissions rates competed with [DOT](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) and ADA. [SOL](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases) overtook ADA on NOV. 18 and almost caught up with DOT five days later. However, SOL came to overtake DOT on DEC. 11, 2021. Today, SOL has 97submissions while DoT has 77. ADA also follows closely with 66 submissions.

**Problem:**

We all know how meme coins became mainstream in the past months. They presented great profit and increasing popularity, that is clear for anyone who had been following the market. But most of them, despite the massive blow-up, are flawed: they all are the same, there is no innovation and the concept repeat itself again and again. Lack of creativity is one of the main issues, while the second one is that too often is a rug.

**Solution:**

Here come into play KittenCoin Asa: Is the first Kitten memecoin on Algorand!

With a fast growing community, white paper coming soon, airdrops and community nft collaborations, it's going to be the next big thing.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Vivaion Stealth Launch Jan 14th - Doxxed Dev - 3D Metaverse Solana :O," 

Many people talk about finding the hidden gem, and it's usually a shit coin or some lousy project, but I think I found a TRUE HIDDEN GEM. This project has passed every check possible and, it's so early that I believe this is the next 100x token and NFT project. It fits the current trend for 2022. The founder is DOX'd with an actual tech company building everything.

The project is called Vivaion Metaverse. It's a 3D cross-platform open-world massively multiplayer online role-playing game. The developer has shown in-game footage of him driving and playing around, showcasing multiplayer all available in their discord. The game gives players ways to earn in so many ways. They can stake their characters at real estate to get a chance to receive rare NFT items. Players can own real estate for advertising purposes and manufacture rare NFTs for players. Those NFTs items get merged with characters to achieve even more in-game.

The game's tokenomics have a deflationary and inflationary protocol to mitigate the production of NFTs. They have AI that monitors the game's market to ensure their game mechanics don't crash the token or NFT market due to poor economic conditions induced by poor game design. The founder and team will answer any of your questions, and their token hasn't even been launched yet. It launches on Raydium DEX tomorrow via Solana Blockchain. Feel free to DYOR.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cyclos taking the lead in DeFi adoption on Solana!,"# Cyclos leading the charge in DeFi adoption on Solana!

Cyclos is an automated market maker (AMM) that brings Uniswap V3-style concentrated liquidity to Solana.

As automated market makers competes for order execution on Serum, two factors are most important:

**1 Order volume** \- larger sell orders mean higher profits for LPs

**2 Order distribution** \- profit is obtained only when orders are fulfilled; placing liquidity at the optimal price intervals increases usage of the LP’s funds.

On top of that Cyclos allows LPs to select the exact price ranges at which their liquidity is active. By creating depth of liquidity around the predicted market price of an asset, larger orders can be executed at an optimized price. Further, LPs are offered greater protection from impermanent loss. Once an asset exits the LP’s price interval, the liquidity becomes inactive. Further, LPs can place their liquidity at multiple price intervals to deploy capital even more strategically.",1,2021-09-04 13:14:09,3

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,The growing AMM in Solana!,"# Here's a glimpse of one of the questions answered by the Cyclos team at their most recent AMA! 

>***How do you think AMMs can grow and develop their project on Solana blockchain in comparison to other blockchains especially Ethereum? What advantages does the Solana ecosystem offer developers working on AMMs? How do you see your project in comparison to Uniswap in the long run?***

Stock exchanges gatekeep algorithmic trading for a small number of high-frequency trading (HFT) firms. Lots of advanced strategies like market making, RSI, and MACD are out of reach for ordinary developers. Crypto exchanges like Binance are more open with API keys, but this limits you to centralized exchanges. HFT needs a lot of capital, which you cannot just crowdsource, like in DeFi. This really limits the space to big players like Alameda.

Traditional DeFi AMMs don’t have order books, limiting what strategies you can build. 0x protocol has order books on ETH, but high gas and low throughput limit the scope for HFT.

Now that Solana has an actual order book DEX a.k.a. Serum, the field is wide open. Wall Street is coming to DeFi and we’re leading that charge.",1,2021-09-07 08:35:51,2
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Foxville.app is the First Decentralized Farm Gaming NFTs on Solana.,"*Create, build and harvest the farm of your dreams with Metaverse, NFTs and play to earn games on Solana.*

DeFi and gaming are two constantly evolving spaces which have created many millionaires in the past few years. Gaming, DeFi and blockchain are the most talked about trio of this decade. Each of these is a complete space in itself that is evolving astronomically. Many projects have tried to introduce their features in them to create the perfect blend to facilitate their audience. However, some got lucky and some didn’t.

Foxville is one such platform that has incorporated the essence of this trio in its platform. It is a NFT based project with a play to earn game coupled with metaverses and cross-chain interoperability with an additional feature of staking. A perfect combo for gamers and investors.

&#x200B;

**What is it…**

Foxville is a decentralized play to earn gaming platform that has integrated DeFi and gaming. It is a GameFi. It has an exciting farm based game unlike the usual old centralized free to play Farmville. Foxville has 11 different categories and 176 versatile traits. A quick comparison between the two can make it clear.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|**Foxville**|**Farmville**|
|:-|:-|
|Play to earn|Free to play|
|Decentralized|Centralized|
|Multiverses|One universe|
|Better visuals, AR, VR|Augmented reality|

This was a quick comparison between our childhood favorite, Farmville and blockchain integrated GameFi, Foxville. However, there are other farm based games on blockchain too.

&#x200B;

|**Foxville**|**FarmTown**|**CryptoBytes**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Play to earn|Free to play|Fun to play|
|Decentralized|Centralized|Decentralized|
|PVE and PVP|PVE|PVE|
|Native token|World currencies|Native token|
|AR, VR|AR|AR|
|Multiverses|One screen|No multiverses|
|Cross-chain interoperability|No cross chain interoperability|No cross chain interoperability|
|Solana Blockchain|\-----|Binance smart chain|

The game of Foxville depends majorly on Fox-Farmers. These Fox-Farmers will be able to harvest crops, and perform other farm duties to create a lavishing farm. These farmers can then sell their assets in the Foxville marketplace to generate wealth to upgrade their living standard and their farm.

**What’s in it for me…**

It works through offering dashing Foxman NFTs coupled with a play to earn game. It enables its users to generate passive income through buying and holding NFT for price appreciation, meanwhile allowing them to stake their NFTs in one of the staking platforms offered by the platform for APY of 60% and more.

Besides carefully catering to the needs of its investor, this platform offers an entertaining game for its audience. The game revolves around the Fox village community. It’s residents can create a small farm on a fertile piece of land and start earning tokens through performing small farm duties. As the players advance in the game, exciting features unlock. The game also offers different playing modes, where players can play against the environment or against other players as well. Moreover, the platform offers in-game item crafting and tournaments to keep its players entertained.

**How do I get them…**

In Addition to these, this platform offers 2D and 3D NFTs for its user to provide better visuals. To add further, this project has multiverses in its game with an added option of virtual reality and augmented reality. Players can travel across these parallel universes to unlock more exciting features.  The Foxman NFTs are designed based on 10 categories and 126 characteristics. These characteristics are further listed on the rarity spectrum which majorly determines the value of NFTs.

Users can purchase the NFTs on the platform. The price of these vary. For 2D NFT the price is 0.5 SOL and for 3D NFTs the price is 2.5  Sol if you upgrade your 2D NFT into 3D NFT. In case your aim to make a fresh purchase for a 3D NFT it costs 5 SOL. Moreover, this project is affiliated with major marketplaces of Solana including, Sol.sea.io, Solanart.io, and others.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"10X - 20X Gem Red Pill -SOL100, a Solana Token — Easy, Fast & Practical 10x — Make it before Christmas - Still under $2,000 per token","Are you into collecting NFT’s? then SOL100 is right up your ally. Appealing to the NFT psychology with its rarity. Running on the Solana blockchain, with lighting speeds and cheaper transactions. Get on board or get left behind!

**-What is SOL100?**

This is a clone of 42-coin on Solana and the first of its type on the Solana blockchain. These usually pump and then fizzle out, but it's never been done with a high throughput blockchain before. The team has just started its marketing efforts. There is a bright future for this token. Original or not, tokens on Solana have a high likelihood of mooning. I try to keep my eyes on the new tokens as they appear on Github, and this one stands out. The website design is immaculate, the team is well versed in English and claim to be westerners - and they appear to be westerners with off-the-cuff stylometric analysis.

This token will be made available for purchase with an initial low market cap of $100K. The presale was only $10K. The presale was only 10% and the founders are only keeping 20%. That leaves 70% for the initial DEX distribution. It should be noted here that the private presale sold out between 7 AM and 9 AM in 1 day, and involved a handful of token purchasers. They paid the same amount in the presale that we'll be paying in the initial Raydium distribution.

\-**The TL;DR**

✔ IDO sold out

✔ Fair launch @ $100k market cap

✔ Collectible/Scarce

✔ Only 100 minted

✔Still less than $2k per token

✔ Western team

✔ 70% of the supply sold to the public

✔ Powered by Solana

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,New intelligent tools coming to Solana,"Crypto wallet analysis company Nansen will begin sifting Solana addresses for trading “alpha” early next year.

The software company will add coverage for the Solana blockchain in the first quarter of next year.

Nansen has made a business by changing blockchain technology’s hard-coded transparency into potentially actionable trading signals for its clients. It uses a blend of public intelligence and heuristics to “label” addresses tied to hedge funds, banks, venture capitalists and large investors – the “smart money” for others to follow, so to speak.

Alexandre Caillol, head of institutional sales at Nansen, explained that Nansen clients have been asking for Solana coverage. The network’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem is worth over $15 billion and has 1.2 million monthly active addresses – all potential gold mines for traders who know how to read them.

What a great move in the crypto space. Solana is really becoming one of the big ones. I wonder how other new coins will evolve like Atpay and Mimirtoken. The crypto game keeps renewing and I am here for it.",1,2021-11-10 22:17:19,0

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Foxville.app is the First Decentralized Farm Gaming NFTs on Solana.,"*Create, build and harvest the farm of your dreams with Metaverse, NFTs and play to earn games on Solana.*

DeFi and gaming are two constantly evolving spaces which have created many millionaires in the past few years. Gaming, DeFi and blockchain are the most talked about trio of this decade. Each of these is a complete space in itself that is evolving astronomically. Many projects have tried to introduce their features in them to create the perfect blend to facilitate their audience. However, some got lucky and some didn’t.

Foxville is one such platform that has incorporated the essence of this trio in its platform. It is a NFT based project with a play to earn game coupled with metaverses and cross-chain interoperability with an additional feature of staking. A perfect combo for gamers and investors.

&#x200B;

**What is it…**

Foxville is a decentralized play to earn gaming platform that has integrated DeFi and gaming. It is a GameFi. It has an exciting farm based game unlike the usual old centralized free to play Farmville. Foxville has 11 different categories and 176 versatile traits. A quick comparison between the two can make it clear.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|**Foxville**|**Farmville**|
|:-|:-|
|Play to earn|Free to play|
|Decentralized|Centralized|
|Multiverses|One universe|
|Better visuals, AR, VR|Augmented reality|

This was a quick comparison between our childhood favorite, Farmville and blockchain integrated GameFi, Foxville. However, there are other farm based games on blockchain too.

&#x200B;

|**Foxville**|**FarmTown**|**CryptoBytes**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Play to earn|Free to play|Fun to play|
|Decentralized|Centralized|Decentralized|
|PVE and PVP|PVE|PVE|
|Native token|World currencies|Native token|
|AR, VR|AR|AR|
|Multiverses|One screen|No multiverses|
|Cross-chain interoperability|No cross chain interoperability|No cross chain interoperability|
|Solana Blockchain|\-----|Binance smart chain|

The game of Foxville depends majorly on Fox-Farmers. These Fox-Farmers will be able to harvest crops, and perform other farm duties to create a lavishing farm. These farmers can then sell their assets in the Foxville marketplace to generate wealth to upgrade their living standard and their farm.

&#x200B;

**What’s in it for me…**

It works through offering dashing Foxman NFTs coupled with a play to earn game. It enables its users to generate passive income through buying and holding NFT for price appreciation, meanwhile allowing them to stake their NFTs in one of the staking platforms offered by the platform for APY of 60% and more.

Besides carefully catering to the needs of its investor, this platform offers an entertaining game for its audience. The game revolves around the Fox village community. It’s residents can create a small farm on a fertile piece of land and start earning tokens through performing small farm duties. As the players advance in the game, exciting features unlock. The game also offers different playing modes, where players can play against the environment or against other players as well. Moreover, the platform offers in-game item crafting and tournaments to keep its players entertained.

**How do I get them…**

In Addition to these, this platform offers 2D and 3D NFTs for its user to provide better visuals. To add further, this project has multiverses in its game with an added option of virtual reality and augmented reality. Players can travel across these parallel universes to unlock more exciting features.  The Foxman NFTs are designed based on 10 categories and 126 characteristics. These characteristics are further listed on the rarity spectrum which majorly determines the value of NFTs.

Users can purchase the NFTs on the platform. The price of these vary. For 2D NFT the price is 0.5 SOL and for 3D NFTs the price is 2.5  Sol if you upgrade your 2D NFT into 3D NFT. In case your aim to make a fresh purchase for a 3D NFT it costs 5 SOL. Moreover, this project is affiliated with major marketplaces of Solana including, Sol.sea.io, Solanart.io, and others.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Professor.finance - A unique use case concept which aims First Utility NFTs using governance based on #Solana,"Professor.finance is a play-to-earn platform where you can mint your robber NFTs. It is a two in one platform which allow user to play a game while making money out of it. The motive of this platform is to offer a space which allow users to play without pay.  
Professor.fiance has some other features in progress. These features will be introduced shortly after the project goes live.

&#x200B;

**MULTIVERSE**  
This feature will allow our users to unlock multiverses in the game. Users will be able to freely move NFTs assets across these different universes.

**IN GAME ITEM CRAFTING**

This feature will allow users to create in-game item. Not only can they create items in the game, they will be able to use these items in different games as well. That is our next feature

**CROSS CHAIN INTEROPERABILITY**

This feature will allow our users to move their, in-game assets or characters across multiple blockchains. It is a crucial feature introduced by DeFi. It enables users for frictionless trade.

**GOVERNANCE**

Professor.fiance is providing an entirely decentralized gaming platform for its users, where, participants can utilize their governance tokens to deicide the location, execution and date of the *Minobbery.*

**How minobberies works?**

Through governance community has power to change the date and place of minobbery. Based on voting final decision will be made.

During a minobbery player’s characters can come across two type of scenarios:

1. Positive scenario. In such scenario your robber character come across a positive scenario during the minobbery and consequently it is rewarded with a rare trait, that could a machine gun, any other ammunition that can strengthen it.
2. The second is an opposite to the prior. In this case your robber will come across a negative scenario that injure him. He might get a shot in the head of get caught by the police. Under both cases he will consequently loss some vale.

Both scenarios are completely random and the sad part is their occurrence cannot be predicted. To me, it sounds pretty exciting. I’m already hooked with the game so far.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Woah! History's Largest IDO completed. Round 2 today. $GARI at less than a dollar. Imagine what would happen once it hits the top 5 exchanges in January 2022.," 

Imagine using Tiktok and getting paid in crypto every time you:

\- Upload a video

\- Watch a video

This is exactly what $GARI is building. A TikTok-like platform powered by crypto. $GARI enables monetization for content creators via NFT Marketplace + Social Commerce + Tipping in crypto. Check out the [Whitepaper](https://media.chingari.io/apipublic/uploads/Gari+Whitepaper+V1.03.pdf)

Today is probably the last day you could get $GARI for less than a dollar (centralized exchange listing planned in the next few weeks - and you know what happens then).

🚀 We are looking at a low-key 100X gem. And I'll tell you why: 📷

* They just raised $4Million in less than 15 minutes on their staking pool IDO yesterday (this is the biggest amount raised in this time frame on an IDO launchpad).
* Backed by Alameda Research (owners of FTX) and Kraken Ventures. Other investors include Huobi Global, SOLANA Capital, Borderless Capital, AngelList, Salman Khan, Village Global, Brian Norgard (Tinder), OnMobile, Republic Labs.
* Unlike most IDOs, where the project owners start with a promise for a future product AFTER raising funds, the GARI team ALREADY has an unrivaled user base of 85 million+ users on its native short-video platform Chingari.
* Raised $12Million+ in a public sale on Republic in November 2021 - which shows strong support from retail investors.
* The PR and marketing of $GARI is being handled by the same PR firm who worked with solid projects like Polkadot, Polygon, Tezos, FTX, Decentraland, Cardano, Solana in their early days.
* To support cost-effective and fast on-chain transactions, $GARI will be deployed as an SPL token on the Solana blockchain — one of the MOST robust Layer-1s in the industry.
* The $GARI token exists to incentivize content creators to produce genuine content while keeping viewers engaged.
* This is the largest IDO in history ($16Million). $4Million in SOLR staked pool completed yesterday within less than 15 minutes. Today is the Open Pool Sale. No Whitelist. FCFS basis :)
* IDO Details:

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Is there any maximalists around? I believe the future is undoubtedly multi-chain!," When I joined the crypto space all the way back in 2018 I remember how everyone was so busy being a maximalist either in Bitcoin, ETH or the next Ethereum killer...

I remember how proud each tribalist was of its own tribe! There was Ripple XRP tribe, there was Ethereum tribe and obviously all the tribes claiming that they'd be the real deal OG ETH killer!

Fast forwarding 4 years, many ups and downs, many Layer 2 protocols, many integrations, an Ethereum merge, I'm glad to see that the tribalism went down massively with a few exceptions like the meme coins and a weird hate of BTC from the BCH tribalists.

I am glad to see whole ecosystems growing around the interoperability motto, like Polkadot and Cosmos have been preaching for a good while.

I'm also very glad to see that many, many projects are now taking the multi chain take as the examples bellow state:

1 - Chain Link, and oracles in general are the perfect example as they collect price data from dozens of chains, making them the pinnacle of interoperability

2 - Ore, a identity and account protocol is available on 7 chains: Ethereum, BSC, Wax, Telos, Eosio, Polkadot and Algorand. And believe it or not, it has plans to expand further!

3 - Dafi , a synthetic rewarding protocol is available on Ethereum, Polygon and BSC and will expand into Solana and Avalanche

4 - Kalmy App, a yield aggregator started on BSC and soon expanded to Avalanche and Fantom

5 - Railgun, a privacy protocol is available on Ethereum, BSC and Polygon. More chains are due to come!

I believe in what I always have believed: the future is multi chain! And I'm really glad that I was right on this one as most of the projects realize that they just have advantages of being available in multiple chains as they'll tap into whole new ecosystems where their products and services can be offered, allowing them to expand further and tap into other markets!

A good analogy for me comparing a crypto project to an enterprise that can expand to new markets or a new country tapping into a whole new range of prospect clients, the major difference should be that in the crypto space everything tends to happen faster, which actually is a good thing!

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,What are your top recommendations for those new to cryptocurrency?,"The top cryptocurrencies did well in February despite worries about inflation, a competitive labor market, and future interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. The most profitable of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in February was Polygon (MATIC), which had a gain of 6.6%.  


These are some of the most well-liked cryptocurrencies that Redditors suggest, own, and support. As of March 6, these cryptocurrencies are likewise under $25 in price, making it simple for newcomers to trading in them: Cartesi, Metis, Dogecoin, Sandbox, and Solana.  


What do you think of this beginner's option? In any of these, would you invest or have you already done so?  


Flynt Finance is typically where I go when I'm planning things like buying some new cryptos because it is useful as a platform for portfolio management.  


Polygon, what about it? Nowadays, in my opinion, it's a need because it works so effectively and because the cost of all the Different network plans may go up much further. Just my personal perspective, though.

Major altcoins, including Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano, followed suit, experiencing drops of at least 10%. According to Coinglass, over $200 million in crypto-tracked futures were liquidated following Powell’s press conference.

**On the Flipside**

* The FOMC has kept interest rates unchanged for four straight months.
* Following the Fed chair’s comment, traditional markets suffered their worst day in four months.
* Over 98% of analysts predict the FOMC will remain hawkish until May 2024
* While the economy exhibits robust activity levels, experts caution that Powell’s non-committal stance on future rate hikes might create uncertainty and hinder long-term planning for businesses and investors.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Question about trading on Jup.ag,"So I have been trying to use jup.ag for trading sol. And it seems like a lot of times where it's seemingly a good spot for a long, there is a liquidity issue and I can't place the trade. It's never an issue for a short from what I've seen but I have been late on several longs already just bc of this issue. And I was wondering if others have experienced it and how common it is. 

The error says due to AUM cap, your desired size exceeds available liquidity of $70 (70 dollars? are you serious?)",1,2023-12-14 02:07:27,5

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,NFTs have the potential to permanently revolutionize how we exchange value,"Do you believe that we are moving closer to digitizing significant elements of our lives? This digitization isn't happening in a metaverse-owns-you-now sense, but rather through tokenizing assets and streamlining transfers.  


Which industry or sector do you believe NFTs are most useful in?  


In a future where cryptocurrencies are extensively utilized, much like the internet, customers will likely not be familiar with the system's underlying technology. Users won't give a hoot about the past's negative implications when they have access to a brilliant new way to buy, rent, or sell something, hence NFTs may be heavily utilized in this situation.  


NFTs, in my opinion, have the potential to permanently revolutionize how we exchange value. Here is a chance to digitize assets in an open economy and, in doing so, speed up the acceptance of blockchain technology in the general market.  


They are now highly significant for many other things. My favorite area where NFTs are thriving is definitely gaming; without their popularity in games, Altura and other tools that are essential for integrating NFTs into games would not exist.  


If NFTs weren't significant for gaming, tech behemoths like Ubisoft, EA, and others wouldn't be talking about them. Gamers began to accept these digital products more and more.  


After efficient and effective solutions are developed, I believe that NFTs simply fulfill functions far better than present systems, which will be evident across industry and consumer markets.",10,2022-10-15 14:52:11,15
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Which crypto asset is the most popular in your country?,"Shiba Inu has been attracting global attention of late, but data suggests that investors in Turkey might be showing the greatest level of interest in the asset. S  


SHIB is among the most popular crypto assets in the transcontinental country, overshadowing assets such as ETH and ADA.  


Tbh, this wasn't a surprise, since I read a couple of days ago that Google Trends data suggests that residents of Turkey account for the most Google searches for “Shiba Inu coin” in the past three months, taking up a huge chunk of the market share, with a value of 100.  


I'm mostly into Metaverse tokens this year, Windfall token seems pretty interesting to me, but I'm as well a fan of Shiba Inu.   


So, it's nice to know that SHIB completely dominates in popularity among several altcoins, overshadowing assets such as Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana.   


Searches for Shiba Inu in Turkey have been overwhelmingly greater than searches for most other altcoins in the past 12 months.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Sick of rugs? Dough Token Creator is going live tonight at 9PM UTC!," The Dough Token Management System (DoughPad) is built to provide all the tools necessary for developers and investors to track, trade and create crypto projects, whilst generating passive income for Dough holders through innovating staking pools.

The external revenues generated by the Dough products are used to exert buying pressure on the Dough chart via buybacks. While these benefits are currently only available for users of BSC, Dough will be launching the platform across chains with other EVM chains as early targets, and further plans to integrate with Cardano, Solana, and Terra.

The short version of why I think this project is definitely worth it:

\- Existing tangible product

\- The project itself fairlaunched in September 2021, so no ICO

\- Continuous development on product

\- Weekly AMA's in Telegram with the CEO and Devs

\- Very active community

\- Dividend payments and Staking

\- Several pending exchange Listings applications

\- And definitely more

The longer version:

Dough focusses on making crypto safer for investors to track, trade and create projects. With innovative features such as a token creator, free lp lockers, biometric KYC, dashboarding, onramping and vetted influencers.

With the tokenomics and the way Dough contract is coded, it is impossible to rug-pull. This also goes for any project being created in the Dough ecosystem. The revenue generated in the ecosystem is fed into a staking contract with 5 pools which reward in DOUGH and BNB.

Simply put, as a Dough holder you can choose to stake your Dough and bring in a passive income.

So what makes Dough special?

Dough is building a ecosystem where developers and investors can Track, Trade and Create tokens. All in one place: the Doughpad.

The Doughpad roadmap contains:

\- Swap AMM + farming

\- Fiat Onramp + Visacard

\- Automated token creator

\- IDO platform + token/reward locker

\- Project backing

\- Ownership locker

\- Automated audit of all contracts created

\- Charting for all dough launched tokens

\- Reward and Portfolio tracker

\- Defi 2.0 Liquidity Protocol

\- NFT marketplace

\- Influencer Hub for devs to book marketing

\- Play2Earn Game Hub

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"There are so many cryptocurrencies on the scene, but how many of them are the most sustainable?","There’s been a lot of attention on Bitcoin’s shocking environmental impact in recent months, and while efforts are being made to minimize the carbon footprint of the cryptocurrency, some investors are jumping ship in favor of greener options.   


There are so many cryptocurrencies on the scene, but how many of them are the most sustainable?  


You probably know that blockchains that require an energy-intensive process, crypto-related or otherwise, can generate excess carbon if they consume energy from non-renewable sources.  


Have you heard about Elan Tokens that will be used to seamlessly pay for Elan devices and electricity, eliminating the hassle of currency exchanges, third parties, and time delays? So, as I figure out by DYOR Elan Tokens are for fair energy distribution, not for profit, which is actually great!  


To be honest, it's extremely difficult to single out one currency as being ""greener"" than others. This is due to the large number of variables at work. Many much smaller cryptocurrencies, for example, naturally have a much lower energy footprint than Bitcoin because they involve far fewer daily transactions.  


With over 4,500 tokens available, I'm sure I've overlooked a few excellent options for long-term cryptocurrencies.  


Given the exponential growth in this area of digital finance, the best is likely yet to come. Please leave a comment if you know of an eco-friendly cryptocurrency.",8,2022-11-02 00:13:34,12

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Point Labs releases full roadmap to Web3 functionality," 

source: [https://news.bitcoin.com/point-labs-releases-full-roadmap-to-web3/](https://news.bitcoin.com/point-labs-releases-full-roadmap-to-web3/)

With “web 3.0” suddenly upgrading from an obscure area of research to a hot topic of mainstream conversation and a significant part of the 2020-s zeitgeist, more and more questions arise about the nature of the beast. Is “Web3” going to stay a vague and undefinable term, or does it have a precise definition?

Besides meanings that became obsolete years ago, like ‘Semantic Web,’ what’s adding to the confusion are all the projects describing themselves as “decentralized” applications (dApps) or “web3”, giving the impression that web3 is already here and alive.

Yet, as we know, such projects still rely heavily on web2 components: using centralized domains that can be taken away at any moment or compromised, centralized storage that is censorable and transparent to mass surveillance, and browser extensions like Metamask or Phantom that Google can disable at any time, which would immediately leave 99% of the users of “decentralized” applications helplessly confused about how to access them. BadgerDAO, a DeFi project hacked for $120M because of centralized UI, shows why this “Web 2.5” approach is in the wrong direction.

**World’s First Full Web3 Architecture**

To correct this, Point Labs began working on recreating all components of the old internet with their decentralized implementations. Instead of clinging to existing web2 scaffolding, the resulting network, nicknamed Point Network, is a virtual space completely disconnected from the old internet, just like blockchains are, which can now be called Web 3.0.

Point Network architecture consists of decentralized domains (.point) which live on the blockchain, decentralized storage on Arweave, decentralized identities, and other tools that help bridge the gap between Web 2.5 and full Web 3.

When you open Point Browser, there is no connection to [facebook.com](https://facebook.com/), [google.com](https://google.com/), or any IP addresses from the old internet (if you try to open a web2 link, you will be redirected to your normal browser). Instead, Point Network forces the developers to use only decentralized components to deploy their dApps, ensuring censorship-resistance, data integrity, data availability, privacy, and enhanced security.

“The Roadmap to Web3”

This combination, founders insist, is the most straightforward definition of Web 3.0: a long-standing dream of technology enthusiasts to have a completely decentralized internet, free of censorship, mass surveillance, and empowering direct ownership of data and audiences, without Big Tech intermediaries taking their cut and asserting dictatorship-like control. But how far are we from achieving this?

Point Labs produced their first prototype a year ago, bootstrapping its development with their own funds. Then, in October 2021, they presented the first alpha version on Solana Ignition Hackathon, which placed them on the Honorary Mentions list and led to raising their Seed and A rounds by venture capital firms, including notable names such as Arweave, Petrock Capital and Solar Eco Fund, and led by Sino Global+FTX fund, which funded a second alpha version, which is now more functional and easier to use.

This week, Point Labs presented their roadmap. And it’s not just a typical ribbon-shaped block on a landing page. Instead, they made it into a whole Trello-like website, which is hosted on [roadmap.pointnetwork.io](https://roadmap.pointnetwork.io/), called “The Roadmap to Web3 ” and is frequently updated. It features two zones: the main zone, presenting the infrastructure required for decentralized internet and is almost done, and the dApp zone, listing use cases and potential decentralized applications for when the main zone is ready and operational.

**The Megaround**

Because it is hard for one company to develop all dozens of dApps required for the full Web 3.0 experience, the current plans are to have one last private VC round dubbed ‘The Megaround’ before the public launch at the end of May, to provide grants to interested teams and founders to incentivize building web3 apps on Point Network. After that, the plans are to launch the mainnet beta by June 1.

As the interest in web3 grows, there will definitely emerge a few projects running for the honor of becoming the golden standard. Is Point Network on the way to be one of them? It seems we’re just a few months away from finding out.",10,2022-04-13 09:08:42,16

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,NFT revenue decreased by roughly 31% in March,"According to the information provided by CryptoSlam, non-fungible token transactions in March decreased by 31.42% month on month, going from $1.03 billion in February to $882.89 million on April 3.  


I read later that the Ethereum network was responsible for the settlement of $537.89 million worth of those transactions in March, which accounted for more than sixty percent of total sales. Following Solana in March’s sales rankings are Polygon ($36.16 million), Immutable X ($28.82 million), and Cardano ($10.08 million), with NFT transactions in Solana accounting for 10.57% of total sales and reaching $93.36 million.  


In March, the BAYC collection was the top-selling product, with sales of $35.81 million. This figure represents a 48.19% reduction from the previous month’s sales. Even though I'm more into ReelStar, BAYC is probably one of the coolest NFT collections we have. The month of February saw Cryptopunks’ sales increase by 87.95%, bringing the total to $30.11 million, making it the second-largest NFT compilation in terms of revenue.  


I believe that for many people this may appear to be a substantial decline, but what I always try to remember in these sorts of days is that's important to keep in mind that NFTs are still a relatively new occurrence in the world of digital art and souvenirs, with their prevalence increasing rapidly in the last year. Furthermore, the market is still changing, with new platforms and markets springing up to meet the demand for NFTs.  


So, what are your expectations this year?",10,2023-04-06 12:54:53,1
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,MoonTrust - crypto chat app released - 1m marketcap - cmc listed," [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moontrust/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moontrust/)

MoonTrust recently released their app, which is basically a crypto token payments platform with friends list, private chat, and group chat features like Telegram/Discord.

youtube video: [https://youtu.be/Od5naDvMNZE](https://youtu.be/Od5naDvMNZE)

**What is MoonTrust?**

Just this year alone, tens of thousands of tokens were created. Most of these token communities were built through Telegram and Discord. Often when new potential investors join these communities, they are misled by the information within the chat channels. This is done by employing bots to hype the project and create traction. Some also employ real humans as moderators who do not even own the token. MoonTrust is a platform to enhance the community by making sure everyone is fully transparent with each other.

**MoonTrust Group Chat Feature**

In [MoonTrust](https://moontrust.net/) only token holders are allowed to chat, and it will show the actual holding amount at the time of the message. Users are also able to create custom chat channels with customizable token holding requirements. This will help community managers manage their “dolphin” and “whale” holders. MoonTrust system will automatically remove holders who no longer meet the token requirements.

**MoonTrust Payments and Friends**

MoonTrust also supports payments between friends. When transferring tokens between friends, you no longer need to remember their public address. Simply find your friend using their unique username and send or request as you would just like Venmo. Final confirmation is done via your software wallet. MoonTrust also supports private messaging between friends. Users can also find common tokens held between each other. This allows users to find new friends who have similar token interests.

**MoonTrust Privacy**

Although MoonTrust offers multiple privacy options for its users, they do not have privacy options for group chat transparency. Group chats are meant to be public and to prevent manipulation. Anyone who chats in group chats will have their token holding value displayed (only for that specific group chat).

**How Can MoonTrust Benefit Token** **Holders?**

MoonTrust group chat system is a heavily needed system in a space where there are tons of rug pulls making headlines every week. Scammers like to airdrop phishing/scam tokens to random address, but with MoonTrust, the community can warn each other in the specific token group chats. Projects that create fake hype by employing influencers, shillers, or bots, will also be exposed with this chat system. Currently, it is also common that communities are managed by mods who do not own tokens in various Telegram and Discord project groups. These mod services are typically paid in stablecoins, ETH, BNB or BTC, but never the specific project token. In MoonTrust, these types of situations will not happen as holders' token value is displayed and only holders can moderate each other. Any bots or scam offenders banned in MoonTrust will have a direct cost of business to scam groups via gas fees of specific blockchains. Currently banning scammers or bots in Telegram or Discord is free. Malicious actors can easily create thousands of accounts. However, in MoonTrust users can only enter a chat group if they have the tokens. This means for every new account, malicious groups need to send tokens to that address, thus costing them money. MoonTrust is dubbing this “Proof of Gas” mechanism. Just imagine the cost of business for these scam groups when using MoonTrust for the ETH chain.

**Upcoming Features**

The MoonTrust team is not stopping with their current iteration of the app. They are also working on a governance and moderation mechanism. The goal is to allow token holders to ban/mute each other based on their stake in the project. For example, a whale can ban a small fish, but if enough fish and dolphins team up, they can also remove whales. Although the MoonTrust App works on mobile devices, the MoonTrust team is also working on iOS and Android apps to improve user interfaces and user experience. They are working on new designs to better suit the viewing and usage experience of mobile devices.

**Upcoming Multiple Blockchain Support**

The MoonTrust project is aiming to launch its platform across all blockchains that have token projects built in them. The MoonTrust team is targeting one blockchain launch per year. Their platform launch for Cardano, Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and Avalanche are currently in the works.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Instagram Set to Support NFTs From Ethereum and Other Leading Blockchains,"According to recent news, Instagram might introduce support for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as soon as next week.

**NFT Pilot Project to Kick Off in the U.S.**

Reports suggest that the Meta-owned social media platform is set to announce a pilot project, initially focusing on a limited number of NFT enthusiasts from the United States. Instagram users will be allowed to post and share NFTs from major platforms such as Ethereum, Solana, Flow, and Polygon in the pilot.

And unlike Twitter, which at first made its users pay to show hexagonal NFT profile pictures, Instagram does not plan to charge users for the privilege.

Also, the social media platform, which has more than a billion active users every month, wants to add popular crypto wallets like MetaMask to its platform.

With this change, users of the popular photo-sharing site will be able to link their wallets to their accounts. This will show that they own any NFTs they post and tag the developers who made them.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Goldman Sachs executive says SOL reminds him of ETH.,"Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal says one of Ethereum’s (ETH) top rivals offers a big opportunity to investors after a price fall.  


In a new strategy session video, the macro guru tells his 52,800 Youtube subscribers that Solana (SOL) has a lot working in its favor to ignite an eventual bull run.  


Pal says that despite some blockchain outages and the impacts of the FTX crypto exchange collapse, Solana appears strong due to its use case potential for brands and consumers.  


“I really like Solana and I understand that the chain breaks. I also understand that they are fixing it. I also understand that’s a no-no. And one of the elements was, it was concentrated in its ownership because of FTX. They are now able to liquidate it and so you’re getting rid of one of the issues.  


Solana itself, I think it’s doing something very clever. In cryptocurrencies, what matters is narrative. Bitcoin narrative, digital gold for example. Ethereum, the distributed Internet for Web3. So where do these other chains fit in? Well, Solana has and is building a narrative, which is that it is the consumer chain. And yes, there are some others doing that. FLOW, I think is another example, much smaller.""  


The present conditions in the crypto market are such that only Blockchain Finance, GameFi (Axie, God's Unchained, CosmoGene and new projects like LifeBeyond)  along with a couple of other projects seem to be doing just fine however the rest are still struggling and waiting to explode, we will see what the future holds for them.",9,2022-11-18 08:01:40,4
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Long term vs short term investing in crypto," Crypto investments have now become the talk of the financial space worldwide. However, there are still speculations about the precise approach to scale profitability through these tokens. The most popular debate is around the long-term utility in contrast with the short-term gains from the[ crypto investment](https://app.adjust.net.in/6m5k691?campaign=Reddit&adgroup=Thread&creative=branded) strategy.

### Short-term investments

Brief crypto investing involves holding the token for a small duration ranging from a few hours to weeks. This comprises buying and selling the tokens before the end of the financial day to make as many returns as possible. Since these coins are global, there's no fixed day duration, which means you can mould the day length to your convenience.

This type of approach is most suitable for investors looking for quick yields with a visible risk-reward ratio. Even though these returns bring decent profits, they don't witness token appreciation at a tremendous rate due to the shortage of time. That being said, short-term investment is also linked to higher risks and skipping certain rewarding opportunities on the days the investor prefers not to participate.

### Long-term investments

Extended crypto investments are beneficial for financiers aiming to diversify their portfolios. This strategy is more fruitful if you want incredible returns in the long run while optimising the accidental losses. Through compounding, Bitcoin has radically grown from $1 to $21,381, implying the potential for long-term increment.

In addition, the additional expenses with crypto are far lesser with long-term investments. Essentially, you will be saved from incurring the transaction fees with a long-term view. So, all you need to do is leave the investment as is for the duration you seem viable.

With the accelerated growth of the crypto market, it's obvious to get confused over the best strategy to follow. If you're willing to handle risky tokens, you can receive great returns quickly with a short-term investment. However, if you wish to stay in the market and gain unprecedented benefits, the long-term strategy is the best way to go!",1,2022-09-19 07:23:06,7

BrandPad is the most secure multi-chain IDO platform in the community allowing projects to procure funds by launching rug-free assets. This platform will help in fulfilling dreams of new creators by making their tokens a success along with ultimate security to the investors which is our foremost priority.

Rug-proof Launchpad🛡

Through our system, the smart contracts automatically add and lock the liquidity once the presale gets finished, thus making the projects rug-free and boosting investor confidence.
 
Locked Liquidity 🔒

IDO projects will be required to lock a percentage(min 60%) of their liquidity with our locking mechanism or with a trusted third party.

Guaranteed Allocation  ⚓️

Based on number of tokens held by the holders; they will be allocated pool weightage accordingly allowing them to have a large allocation in quality projects.

Safest Launchpad 🏰

Since safety of the investors is our priority, we assure the investors their safety in early-stage projects by implementing KYC system and strict investigation. Only thoroughly vetted, audited and analyzed blockchain projects will be given a chance to launch.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,🔥 Cardence is the next big IDO platform | First presale platform with referral marketing inbuilt | Multichain protocol | MVP is already deployed | Techrate Audited | Public Team | Qualified founders & Advisors | Presale is live. 70% filled already 🔥," 

What sets it apart from others is the innovative features which are not available on other platforms.

For example, the greatest pain point of projects is to market themselves. Word of mouth is the best form of marketing which creates a viral effect. Rewarding users to refer other investors to the presale with a commission over the transaction value will incentivize users to market the project. Cardence is the only presale platform that facilitates trustless affiliate marketing techniques.

Cardence is a Cardano focused multichain decentralized presale platform which creates a trustless fundraise ecosystem. It is launching on BSC, Ethereum, Matic, Cardano, and Solana networks. It is the first presale platform which facilitates affiliate marketing of projects, release of tokens according to vesting schedule, whitelisting of participants and auto locking of liquidity. Additionally, Dapps like SmartMint and Locker App allow creation of new tokens without writing any code and creation of time locked token vaults for release of tokens according to a vesting schedule.

Another great feature is to allow project owners to release the tokens according to a vesting schedule. Presale investors receive tokens at significantly discounted rates and tend to dump sooner after listing. This hampers growth of the project. Applying vesting schedule for release of tokens ensures that not all tokens can be dumped simultaneously.

Other Cool features :

Whitelisting of wallets addresses

Smart lock app for token and LP tokens locking. It will also allow for time locked transfer of tokens, locking of tokens according to vesting schedule, and also for bulk distribution of tokens according to a vesting schedule.

Smart Mint : Innovative token minter working of multiple chains.

🔥 Why to participate - 🔥

✅ Cardence is World's first decentralised launchpad to offer release of token as per vesting schedule, create presale only for whitelisted wallet, affiliate marketing option for projects, liquidity locking, smart mint features, staking, assured IDOs , DAO structure, guaranteed participation for everyone, all at one place. 🔥

✅ Multichain launchpad with special focus to Cardano projects.

✅ Smart contract audited by Techrate and can be seen here -

✅ Doxxed devs and reputed advisors, Ahmed Omar founder of COD coin and Author of “The Future With Blockchain” is one of our Advisor, all info is public and can be seen on our site

✅ Cardence is one of the top voted coin on every coin sites, we are already listed on CMC 🚀

✅ Cardence will be listed on pancakeswap as well as on CEXs like Indoex, Latoken and we are currently negotiating the terms with Gate io and BitMart. 🔥

✅ Strategic partnerships with ChainLink , TBA soon, contract has already been signed. 🔥🚀

✅ Ownership renounced, team tokens locked. 🔥

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Which cryptocurrency is the most environmentally friendly in your opinion?,"Even if most cryptocurrencies rely on the use of energy to generate value, there are a few that are not. These eco-friendly cryptocurrency alternatives have a low carbon footprint and may even provide genuine environmental benefits.  


Do you know any of these green cryptocurrencies? In my opinion, finding the most energy-efficient cryptocurrency can help you make environmentally responsible investment decisions. As a result, the entire planet may benefit from a more environmentally friendly future.  


By switching from PoW to PoS systems, the amount of energy required to generate cryptocurrency will be significantly reduced. Finding low-energy cryptocurrency options can provide green-conscious investors with additional ways to save energy and protect the environment.  


Tokens that save/provide/reduce energy have always piqued my interest. I am aware that Elan tokens provide energy without charging exorbitant fees, for equitable energy distribution, and for no profit. Which cryptocurrency is the most environmentally friendly in your opinion?  


As reported by the Harvard Business Review, Bitcoin consumes approximately one hundred terawatt hours of electricity per year, which is roughly half of annual global energy production.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,What triggered $SOL to $13,"It is obvious $SOL fall affected the community especially as it was unexpected. The recent turnaround of event on $SOL from $7 to $13 could be triggered by the first solana Dog meme coin. $BONK aims to support the solana community by airdropping 50% to the community and bringing back liquidity to the solana ecosystem. Since launching, the token has hit over $24 million daily trading volume and is now the top trending token on Coingecko and Twitter with interest from top CEX listing.

MEXC in its quest to list moon shot tokens very early was first to spot and list $BONK followed by Huobi and more CEX are expected to follow. As usual, many airdrop opportunities are available for users to benefit from. For example, MEXC has launched a referral for users to benefit from $10,000 worth of $BONK and a deposit to earn 2000 MX (The native token of the exchange).",1,2023-01-04 09:49:41,1
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"2030 Coin Prediction: Cardano (ADA) Leads Twitter Polls by 82%, Will It Really Be The Biggest Of The Lot?","CoinQuora reported earlier today on the Twitter poll by the crypto community on May 18, 2022, where ADA leads by quite some margin getting 82% of votes over three other altcoins. 

 A Twitter user with 26.7k followers ran a poll requesting people to vote for the coin they believe will remain until 2030. Along with ADA, they listed Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Algorand (ALGO). At the time of writing, 12,983 Twitter users voted. 82% of the respondents favored Cardano’s ADA, while only 3% picked Avalanche.  But some of the guys replying to the post expressed zero confidence in the four listed tokens. Citing the disastrous implosion of Terra (LUNA). 

They said their conviction remains with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).  While it is impractical to tell which coin is the next Bitcoin, experts have parameters in place to vet the sustainability of a crypto project.

 The sustainability of a coin may be from its use cases, team, web presence, community, etc.  Nonetheless, every cryptocurrency has a reason to exist. It may exist as a payment method like USDC, or a utility token, like Solana, to verify transactions on a blockchain or a reward token like $Solis which is used to return value to content creators.

 The idea is that an absence of a use case for a coin strongly indicates something fishy. Do you think ADA is right up there?",0,2022-05-20 19:31:13,9

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,The cryptocurrency market is characterized by cycles of projects claiming to be giant killers,"You probably noticed how the cryptocurrency market is characterized by cycles of projects claiming to be giant killers. Altcoins that were said to be used for everyday money, for example, appeared in the early history of Bitcoin.  


All of these cryptocurrencies were founded on the premise that they were faster and had lower fees than BTC, but this did not allow these projects to gain widespread traction.  


Ethereum was the altcoin that truly made an impact in the cryptocurrency world. This currency immediately wowed me because it wasn't even attempting to be a ""Bitcoin killer,"" as most cryptos did. Ethereum brought smart contracts to the blockchain world, paving the way for important industry trends like DeFi and NFTs.  


Once Ethereum became popular, it ran into some issues, such as slowness and high fees when its network is forced. As a result, many ETH assassins, including Solana, have emerged.  


And yet thanks to Metis and L2 solutions, which come in handy in these situations, I was able to deal with that issue.  


The cryptocurrency employs a hybrid consensus model of PoS and PoH to ensure scalability. It also has a low transaction cost because it is designed to keep fees for apps with billions of users as low as possible.  


These characteristics would undoubtedly make Solana a formidable competitor for Ethereum. However, history repeats itself, and a project claiming to be a ""killer"" of its predecessor continues to lose market share.  


In 2022, Solana, like other cryptocurrencies, experienced a sharp correction. The altcoin has dropped by more than 90% since its all-time high in November 2021. In the early months of cryptocurrency, network outages on the smart contracts platform were common.  


Many users claim that SOL isn't particularly innovative; what are your thoughts? Is it safe to assume that Solana will be the next cryptocurrency to fail?",9,2022-11-24 15:58:53,0
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"According to Google data, Retail Interest in Bitcoin is Dwindling. Do you agree?","   
 According to search data from Google Trends, Bitcoin's (BTC) price spike to as high as $69,000 last year and a range above $40,000 this year has failed to pique consumers interest.  Google trend allows users compare the relative volume of searches.   
This does not imply that the total number of searches for that phrase is dropping; rather, it indicates that its popularity is declining in comparison to other searches.   Some analysts believe that retail investors are shifting their attention to fresh sectors and marketplaces in the crypto world, such as tokens of decentralized finance (DeFi) or layer 1 blockchains. Executive director of EVODeFi, a firm that provides cross-chain solutions, Egor Volotkovich, agreed. According to him, three areas of interest that are attracting investors from all around the world are decentralized banking, non-fungible tokens, and blockchain gaming.   
Meanwhile, some, such as Vasja Zupan, president of cryptocurrency exchange Matrix, say that the search data does not reflect institutional investor interest.  I agree with the second stance that bitcoin's online popularity dose not correlate with retail interest. Bitcoin is a household name has even a lay man has basic knowledge of the cryptocurrency or has heard of it. It however can be argued that cryptocurrecies such as Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot, Faith tribe, Monero, Ethereumhave piqued crypto enthusiasts and investors alike. Bitcoin remains the most popular and most held cryptocurrency.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Introducing: The Real Web 3.0," 

Are we finally on the verge of upgrading our internet infrastructure to its long-awaited next generation, known as Web 3.0? The first version of the Internet consisted of read-only, static websites, whereas Web 2.0 introduced the opportunity to engage with, and create content, enabling activities such as social networking, online banking and shopping. But it has serious flaws around security, privacy, and censorship. On top of that, the dominance of tech giants has only contributed to the further exploitation of users.

Web 3.0 is changing this by defining new standards for the Internet using blockchain technology. And while many “web3” projects are still critically relying on centralized services, such as centralized domains, cloud storage, and browser extensions (deserving to be called Web 2.5 instead), there is one startup,  Point Labs, which is pushing for a radical decentralization of all main internet components, finally coming close to fulfilling the complete definition of a real Web 3.0.

### What is Point Network?

Point Network is a software suite, consisting of blockchain-based peer-to-peer network Point Chain, a locally running node called Point Core, and a decentralized browser called Point Browser, providing all that is needed to enjoy the full Web 3.0 experience. Instead of centralized domains, that can be taken away by ICANN and the U.S. government at any moment, it features decentralized domains, living on the blockchain. Instead of relying on cloud storage, everything on this new internet has to come only from Arweave, which is a decentralized storage network, thus providing data integrity and censorship resistance for websites and dApps. Powering this economically is POINT,  a utility token designed mainly for micropayments to storage providers and validators for the usage of the decentralized internet.

In the current crypto-sphere, users are forced to deal with a lack of standards, configuring and maintaining a patchwork of diverse blockchains and dApps, each with its implementation of common parts. Standards like ERC-20 and Metamask API have helped a little; however, [Point Network](http://pointnetwork.io/) aims to solve all of these challenges using a special Web 3.0 browser called Point Browser, and a locally running node software Point Core.

As a result, a web3 user only has to log in to Point Browser with one seed phrase to immediately be allowed to access decentralized websites and dApps on Point, Ethereum, Solana and other chains, or even send Bitcoin and Bitcoin Lightning transactions.

### Creating More Opportunities

Once the main infrastructure for a real Web3 is created and operational (and the company have already launched [a public alpha](https://pointnetwork.io/alpha) with a growing userbase), it opens up a world of possibilities for web3 dApps. For instance, when the Point Labs recently released their [roadmap](https://roadmap.pointnetwork.io/) (which, unlike other crypto projects, is not merely a few points on a timeline, but a whole Trello-shaped website), it became clear that they are working on Point Social, a decentralized censorship-resistant social network with transparent algorithms, and Point Mail, end-to-end encrypted decentralized email service supposed to surpass Protonmail in terms of privacy.

 However, it also becomes clear that one team, no matter the funding and the popularity, wouldn’t be able to quickly build all of the decentralized successors of Youtube, Reddit, Github, Google Drive, and so on. This is why, instead of trying to take all the Web3 pie pieces for themselves, Point Labs would be raising one last private mega-round in May before the public launch, which could help fund and support with grants several startups in parallel, building the necessary Web3 apps on Point. This means that this is the prime time for the next Steve Jobses, Larrys and Sergeys, and Jack Mas to claim a stake in the *terra-incognita* of Web3.

### How soon can we enjoy real Web3?

Recreating the internet from scratch with enforced decentralization on every level is no small feat and requires a lot of research, engineering and testing. There is already [a public alpha](https://pointnetwork.io/alpha) of Point Network, with which anyone wishing to become an early adopter can explore the network and[ a Telegram group](https://t.me/pointnetworkchat) where they can enroll as an alpha tester to get some USDC for providing feedback.

Point Network is still in its early days and hasn’t yet morphed into its final form, just like the internet of the 90s couldn’t have possibly prepared us for the unimaginable possibilities which would come decades later. However, this is enough for curious minds to get a taste of what a real Web3 could be like, and take part in molding its early history, by sharing feedback and discussing ideas within the community, contributing to Web3 becoming a successful reality sooner.",7,2022-05-05 14:53:49,6
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Crypto Laws needs to be improved, this isn’t to say we need stricter rules","This is coming off the back of a $5million law suit filed against Coinbase for the unauthorized selling of 79 Cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, the prominent US based cryptocurrency exchange platform is embroiled in an unlicensed sale of cryptocurrencies that may soon be entering the securities class. 

Three Customers are trying to sue Coinbase and according to the law suit, they could be deemed to be securities and this makes a sale illegal. They demand that there should be a $5 million collective reimbursement for anyone who has acquired any of the 79 listed cryptocurrencies. Of the 79 listed tokens, notable and prominent are Dogecoin, Solana and Ripple. The three plaintiffs contend that Coinbase should have registered as a national securities exchange with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But a filing of this nature would subject Coinbase to a slur of substantial regulatory and reporting requirements that stock exchanges have to abide by. 

Furthermore , the SEC has been slow to regulate and categorize crypto assets, and it may be a long while until the US government puts together any kind of legislative structure regulating crypto assets. The legal area of Crypto is still shaky and there is a need move away from being strict to crypto, to a proper regulation of it. It is also important that Customers become more aware of their crypto platform before purchasing assets as. There are several platforms for Crypto transaction like Binance and Konstellation's Vega X which is built on $darc. At the current state, one can only hope for the immediate proper regulation of crypto and its registeration as a digital assets as this will protect the investors.",22,2022-04-03 18:01:40,5

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,All Ethereum killers will not succeed says Blockdaemon’s lead Freddy Zwanzger. Do you agree with Freddy Zwanzger that the Ethereum killers have no chance?,"
The world's second-largest blockchain, Ethereum has had a series of top-tier competitors in the crypto space, with quite a number of them deemed the title ‘Ethereum killer’ due to their increasing advancements in the space. 

Blockdaemon Ethereum lead, Freddy Zwanzger believes that despite previous competitor cryptocurrencies like Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot having shown a remarkable steady rise in the crypto space, with lower transaction fees and faster networks, the Ethereum blockchain will retain its leadership position in the crypto ecosystem, being first and most important smart contract platform. 

With the current crypto winter, Ethereum's competitors are undergoing projects and advanced upgrades; Cardano’s Vasil hard fork, Zetrix blockchains use of cross-chain technology to facilitate smart contracts, scalability, and security of global enterprises, and Polkadot's introduction of new parachains. The Ethereum blockchain may shake things up more and propel its advancement further following its merge which would improve its performance, scalability, and network capacity.",2,2022-07-25 08:06:38,2

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Did you notice that there's been a lot of buzz regarding ADA lately? I would say that is unquestionably a good indication!,"Cryptocurrencies have outperformed practically every other financial asset, and with enough research, you can identify important price points to enter and begin increasing your portfolio.  


Interesting fact is that Cardano and Solana are often searched on the internet, and cryptocurrency investors are buying enormous numbers of these tokens, suggesting that both cryptos might help their investors make a lot of money in 2022.  


Do you believe Cardano will have a successful year?  


Keep in mind that activity on the Cardano blockchain is picking fast, with 400 new projects in the works and 100,000 new wallets established in the last month.  


I've been hearing lately that we should keep a watch on Cardano or this new cryptocurrency - Unicoins, since these two are about to skyrocket.  


Did you notice that there's been a lot of buzz regarding ADA lately? That is unquestionably a good indication!  


ADA has acquired great acceptance and has lately witnessed a significant price increase. The rising demand for ADA provides a chance to participate in the next crypto bubble. What are your thoughts about that?",3,2022-05-08 19:36:27,5
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Expert: Altcoins Can Make Market New Bottom in Next Few Months,"The entire cryptocurrency market is down by 4.80% over the last day. Likewise, according to the news published by CoinQuora, some experts believe that even more market crashes will happen in the coming months.

In addition, Ash WSB, a crypto trader, posted a graph on Twitter of the total altcoins market for the year 2018/19 vs. 2022/23.

To name a few, here are some of the altcoins that can contribute to making a new bottom in the next few months.

1. Cardano
Cardano is third-generation crypto. Its features offer the best blends of first and second-generation cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. It uses Proof of Stake (PoS), enhancing its sustainability compared to other cryptosystems.

2. Shiba Inu
Shiba Inu is another meme coin that is also one of the biggest competitors of Dogecoin. The community has also formed an NFT project around SHIB that has enabled it to gain more interest from investors.

3. Decentraland
Decentraland is the virtual reality game token built on the Ethereum blockchain. It has been described as a 3D virtual world where users buy land to create and monetize content, and buy goods and services.

4. Bobcoin
Bobcoin is built on an environmental project which is creating thousands of jobs and declaring war against pollution through the world of Crypto.

5. Solana
Solana fits up well with Ethereum in two critical areas for development, speed, and low transaction costs. It has enticed many crypto investors due to its revolutionary qualities.

6. Terra
Terra (LUNA) carries a lot of advantages in the market. The network presents competitive programmable payments, logistics, and an infrastructure created to simplify dApp and stablecoin development.",13,2022-05-11 18:18:43,4
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Top Altcoins to Watch out for in 2022-23," With no end in sight to the bear market, attention is shifting to some of the [top altcoins](https://blog.coindcx.com/cryptocurrency/top-altcoins-2022/) available on the market. Part of this shift is related to prominent tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) losing momentum. It also helps that altcoins are just a more expansive and forgiving space for crypto enthusiasts right now.

So, these are the 8 altcoins worth looking at in 2022-23:

**Cardano:** The first network to host peer-reviewed research, Cardano has established a partnership with New Balance. This new trend of brand-token partnerships imply that corporations and global institutions are beginning to take the crypto space seriously.

**ApeCoin:** After the Bored Ape project, ApeCoin was designed to help the community govern itself. With the token, you can participate in collective decisions regarding the crypto itself. Now, prices are projected to soar high in September, making this the ideal time to buy in.

**Flow:** Designed for ease of use and smooth deployment of smart contracts, Flow gives you access to a host of developer resources. The platform also rewards you if you help manage the validation nodes to verify new transactions.

**Polygon:** Currently trading for slightly below 50 cents, Matic is expected to be volatile in the future. However, the consistent development around the network means that you should keep an eye out.

**Ripple:** Ripple is already the favorite of most global financial institutions. Designed for seamless integration and borderless payments, Ripple could very well be what the banking sector wants out of crypto. 

**Celo:** Specifically meant to simplify stablecoin creation, Celo lets you develop apps on the network. Those apps then offer you the chance to pay in any currency you wish.

**Algorand:** With low fees and a scalable blockchain, Algorand is already credited as the development ecosystem for several decentralized apps. These apps are now in multiple sectors, including healthcare and finance.

**Solana:** Solana is now neck and neck with ETH. Marginal fees and no hard cap on minimum tokens have interested investors in this blockchain. It also helps that the company is bringing out a new phone with an integrated crypto wallet and web 3.0 technology.

Some tokens are going to come back stronger once the crash is done. Nevertheless, that won't make these tokens any less volatile. Right now, it's important not to engage in reckless trading or investments and hold on to your current portfolio.",1,2022-08-18 08:51:48,2
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Bitcoin Falls to 2022 Low,"The price of Bitcoin dropped 3% on Sunday, ending a week in which the popular cryptocurrency dropped 13%.

Numbers: The price of Bitcoin fell to $33,000 on Sunday, a low for 2022. To put this into perspective, the price was $42,000 last month. We’re obviously a long way off from the all-time high from last year.

Bigger Picture: And this wasn’t the only cryptocurrency to sink this week. Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and even Dogecoin fell.

Catalyst: Bitcoin, and by extension the larger crypto market, is dealing with the same problems as the stock market. It was a bad week for stocks. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates last week, which had an impact on investments.

Linked: Market analysis firm IntoTheBlock noted on Friday that the stock market has developed stronger correlations with crypto over the last six months due to bearish sentiment and the Fed’s actions.

That’s Low: Bitcoin could potentially go down to $29,000, according to one analyst.

Final Thoughts: It is unclear where Bitcoin is headed in the short term, but some investors are still bullish on the long-term prospects of the crypto.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,InvestDex.io - The most advanced All-In-One Crypto Trading Station," 

InvestDex is a multifaceted crypto token organization platform that equips traders with the tools to effectively manage their trade workflow, acquire or sell tokens securely, and manage such token acquisition or sale strategically while keeping a close watch on the pulse of the cryptocurrency market.

InvestDex is the first-of-its-kind workstation with a special focus on the DeFi Space, essentially making trading easier and more structured. By combining traditional task management software with the most advanced data available on the market, InvestDex’s purpose is to let you visualize, manage, and organize your assets, so traders can gain an edge on the market and strategize their investments in a well-organized manner.

The project launching was postponed with 3 months by the team and instead of raising funds early, they first preferred to develop their product and to start with confidence in this entrepreneurial journey. The project launched on 15th of June on Pancakeswap right after the completion of its triple IDO on TosDis, DuckStarter and BSCPAD. It was sold out in a matter of minutes. It’s important to notice that the amount of funding from VC’s was limited, preferring instead to give an opportunity to the community to enter at the seed sale stage. All early rounds of funding have been heavily vested to protect all of the investors from heavy selling pressure at listing. The contract address (0x853A8Ab1c365ea54719EB13A54d6B22F1fBe7FEb) is audited by SolidGroup and 75% of the liquidity is locked with Unicrypt. The other 25% are reserved for a pool on ETH which will bring Uniswap and cross-chain in a due time.

The next 2 weeks are free of charge using the platform. The payment of subscription fees will only be handled in the native INVEST token by connecting your Metamask wallet. Furthermore, InvestDex introduces a tiered system, where people who hold a predefined amount of INVEST tokens or who provide liquidity will qualify for discounts on monthly subscription fees as well as additional services.

In addition to all of this, InvestDex maintains a deflationary system where 50% of the tokens collected from subscription fees will be burned for the first six months and 15% of these fees will be burned the following year.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Chainlink Opts to wait for Ethereum POS merge before resuming operations on Ethereum,"Chainlink oracle solutions provider blockchain has decided to disregard forked versions of Ethereum, which is the POS version, and wait on the upcoming Ethereum Proof of stake (POS) transition before resuming operations. 
 
It’s a well-known fact that Ethereum’s Proof of work had consumed over 90% of energy, which was one of the major factors of its merge decision. According to cointelegraph, Its current POS transition will drastically reduce energy consumption to almost 0.5% while also enhancing its scalability features, and ensuring more decentralization. Much like most POS blockchains in the space, including Solana, Polkadot, and Zetrix blockchain which uses cross-chain technology to provide smart contracts, scalability, privacy, and security services. 

Similarly, Chainlink also provides hybrid smart contracts so the Ethereum merge which will potentially affect every smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain may also affect Chainlink. Hence, a major reason for Chainlink to resume its services after the POS  merge.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Based on the rate of development that has taken place over the past two years, I believe that the world will be transformed in the coming years","In the past year, NFTs have become very popular all over the world. They were among the most popular search terms in 2021, outpacing Dogecoin, blockchain, and even Ethereum.   


People were talking about this a lot. Do you know that several NFT systems are using more environmentally friendly methods of minting by combining energy-efficient blockchains like Tezos, Flow, Polygon, and Solana?   


Do you think that NFTs will continue to be a popular form of digital asset?  


When it comes to some of the ""fancy"" NFTs, I know a slightly different example called the Faith Tribe, where you have to be part of the community as a designer, influencer, blogger, or whatever, and you earn tokens that you later use to buy.   


NFTs that bring you even more benefits and all those cool fashion items, clothes, loyalty programs, and so on.NFT, in my opinion, is consistent with the human need for ownership and authenticity.   


The debut of NFTs has made people happy, and I myself am happy about it.   


Are you expecting the use of NFTs to grow even more this year? Based on the rate of development that has taken place over the past two years, I believe that the world will be transformed in the coming years.",2,2022-07-02 21:37:33,3
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Celo ($CELO) In-Depth Analysis,"There are more than 7.7 billion people on Earth, of which more than 6 billion have mobile phones, and about 1 billion are crypto users. At the same time, more than 4 billion people cannot access official financial services. This is explained by the fact that banks simply do not want to serve the poor and impose high fees on cross-border payments, remittances, and other financial transactions. The Celo project aims to reshape the current monetary system and provide financial prosperity for everyone. Find out how Celo changes the game in our article.

### What Is Celo?

Celo is a highly scalable, EVM-compatible blockchain that intends to provide financial prosperity for everyone. The project is an open platform with financial tools available to all mobile device users. The system operates on a decentralized basis and is characterized by adaptability. It is aimed at forming a reliable structure for building a stable financial system.

The developers have repeatedly noted that their key task is to overcome the problems associated with the lack of access to reliable coins and reduce poverty. The distinctive features of Celo are simplicity and accessibility so that it can be used even by those far from the sphere of blockchain and DeFi. Celo aims to break the framework imposed by the current financial structure and enable users to send and receive money via mobile phone. In addition, Celo provides developers with a highly scalable, EVM-compatible runtime. Among other things, the key feature of Celo is the ability to pay gas fees using whitelisted ERC-20 tokens.  


### Celo Key Features

**1. Mobile-First Approach**

As already mentioned, Celo is designed to provide access to the financial structure to all users with mobile phones and the Internet. Celo team provides a fast, cost-effective, and secure Valora wallet focused on mobile phone users. Valora wallet uses the lightweight Plumo client protocol, which allows seamless sync and interaction with the Celo blockchain. Valora allows users to buy, send, spend, and earn. Users can claim their 12% weekly reward for using Valora. But the most crucial point is that Valora users no longer need to use long, unmemorable wallet addresses since users’ phone numbers are used instead. Moreover, Valora users can easily send cryptocurrency to their relatives and friends that do not even have crypto wallets. All this is thanks to the lightweight identity protocol, which uses a smart escrow contract that releases funds only after the recipient verifies his phone number in the Celo system.

As for the developers, this approach is extremely advantageous for them. After all, with the help of Celo, developers can build easy-to-use apps that do not differ in any way from traditional ones and can be available in app stores.

**2. Celo Consensus Mechanism**

Celo strives to make financial services accessible even to users from developing countries. Although this group of the population has mobile phones, for the most part, they are far from the most advanced, that is, those that are underpowered in computing. For this reason, the Celo developers rely on the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, which allows users to run light clients on low-power devices. Celo uses three innovations to provide a better light client sync experience:

* Users who run light clients should not download the block header for each block but only the epoch block headers. The epoch block headers contain information about the current validator sets, which change daily. Therefore, users only need to download once a day.
* Celo uses a scalable and secure IBFT consensus algorithm along with BLS signatures. Simply put, only a part of the selected validators is responsible for signing blocks. Their signatures are collected into one and stored on-chain. This approach significantly reduces the size of the blockchain.
* In addition, the Plumo protocol allows light clients to verify transactions quickly. Plumo is a zk-SNARK protocol that allows Celo to significantly reduce the time costs and the amount of data required for transaction verification.

These technologies allow Celo to be a lightweight, highly scalable blockchain with high throughput and 5-second block finality.

**3. EVM-compatibility**  

On the way to improving compatibility, Celo implemented a Donut Hardfork in May 2021. This solution allowed the Celo blockchain to become fully EVM-compatible. In simple words, Celo now supports Ethereum transaction types, giving users and developers access to all Ethereum-based apps and tools. In addition, developers can seamlessly port their dapps from Ethereum to Celo and benefit from the speed, low gas fees, and various innovative toolkits. Moreover, this step allows Celo to build new bridges to Solana, Cosmos, and NEAR.

### CELO Token

The main token of the ecosystem is an ERC-20 compatible CELO token. CELO has a limited maximum supply of 1 billion, 46% of which are in circulation. 600 million tokens were circulated upon launch, while the remaining ones were gradually distributed via rewards and fees. The CELO token allows holders to earn rewards, staking, and voting power. In addition, part of the CELO supply is sent to the Celo Reserve to maintain the price stability of built-in stablecoins.

In addition to the native CELO token, there are also several stablecoins ― Celo dollar (cUSD), Celo euro (cEUR), and Celo real (cREAL). These stablecoins are over-collateralized algorithmic stablecoins and operate based on Mento's stability protocol. Pegging to fiat currencies is supported by Celo Reserve, which includes various whitelisted assets, including BTC and ETH. With low fees and fast transactions, ecosystem tokens are perfectly suitable for:  
**remittances;**

**cross-border payments;**

**payments for goods and services;**

**charity, and so on.**

In addition, Celo allows users to use some ERC-20 tokens to pay gas fees. You can send cUSD to your friends and relatives and not pay the fee from the cUSD balance.

### Celo Ecosystem 

The Celo team contributes significantly to the development of the mobile-first movement and creates conditions for the prosperity of local economies. In addition to the Valora wallet described above, which allows you to use phone numbers as addresses, Celo also provides two DeFi products:

* Ubeswap is the mobile-first DeFi exchange. The exchange allows you to instantly swap assets, provide liquidity, earn rewards, and stake tokens.
* Moola is a mobile-first lending protocol. Users can deposit CELO, cUSD, cEUR, and cREAL tokens and earn rewards paid by borrowers.

The Celo ecosystem also includes the Celo Terminal. Users can easily manage their accounts, send and receive funds, participate in decision-making, and access decentralized applications on this all-in-one platform.

In addition, the project team has developed Celo Camp. This is a virtual 8-week training camp with mentoring from industry leaders. Within the framework of the project, users can get the necessary knowledge and skills to build innovative projects and receive funding.

### Conclusion

Celo is a truly revolutionary project that aims to reshape the current monetary system and provide financial freedom even to those who do not have access to banks. The project has a bright future and support from many global partners. In addition, the project team has created Celo Alliance which aims to solve real-world problems and create conditions for prosperity for everyone: residents of developing countries, refugees, local merchants, and so on.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis: What Should We Expect in the Next 48 Hours? Do you see a bullish trend after this?,"
Cardano (ADA) is a third-generation, decentralized proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform like Solana, Concordium and PolkaDot, designed to be a more efficient alternative to proof-of-work (PoW) networks. Scalability, interoperability, and sustainability on PoW networks like Ethereum are impeded by the infrastructure burden of growing costs, energy use, and slow transaction times.

Cardano (ADA) is ranked number 8 in CoinMarketCap’s list of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap. ADA experienced a 24-hour gain of 3.06% to take its price up to $0.4737. This also settles its total market cap at roughly $15.95 billion. ADA has seen an increase in its total 24-hour trading volume as the figure now stands at $845,606,302 which is a 25.24% rise over the last day.

CoinQuora’s post earlier today showed that ADA’s price has recently broken above the 9 and 20 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines as can be seen from the daily chart above. This comes after ADA’s price closed the last four out of five days in the green, leading to a multi-day positive sequence. The last red candle was yesterday as the 9 and 20 EMA lines tried a last-stitch effort to keep ADA’s price down.",1,2022-07-19 20:16:55,2
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Here is the latest news from Metaverse," The metaverse is about to explode soon, and everyone from Tencent to HTC is here for it.

**HTC is bringing its Crypto phone**

Recently, Solana announced the 'Saga', a new phone designed to be used with web 3.0. HTC is bringing its variant of a [Metaverse Phone](https://blog.coindcx.com/crypto-news-global/htc-launches-metaverse-phone/), the Desire 22 Pro. The device will have pre-installed 'Viverse' apps to let you manage your Metaverse content and NFT & crypto portfolios. 

The Desire 22 is optimized to work with HTC’s Vive Flow VR headset. This has a more exciting implication than you realize. This means that in the future, Augmented Reality (AR) setups could fit into the palm of your hand.

**Tencent is forming its own ‘Extended Reality’ team**

Getting kicked out from PUBG Mobile hasn't deterred Tencent Holdings Ltd. from trying to get back into the gaming industry. The company just announced a fully-fledged Extended Reality (XR) team under the management of Li Shen, the Chief Technology Officer at Tencent.

Details are very sparse now, except that the XR team will have over a staff of 300 and will focus on interactive entertainment. Knowing Tencent, it'll probably be another mobile game loaded with micro-transactions. 

**The gaming industry will lead the metaverse market to a $28 billion valuation by 2028**

The metaverse market is worth around $500 million presently. According to estimates, the gaming industry will allow the market to grow at a compounded annual rate of 95%. 

This means more interactive AR games! PCs will profit the most from this new surge of games, with other consoles following closely behind. 

Several projects are already being sold as the next big thing in gaming. Some let you buy virtual land, and others let you collect rent. However, you must be cautious with the hype around such projects. Earth 2 stands as the perfect example of this. 

Anyone involved with the gaming industry remembers what a failure that project was.",2,2022-08-17 09:35:07,1
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Former Head of TikTok Gaming Launches New Startup Focused on Blockchain Games Interoperability. Are Blockchain Games the Next Generation of The Gaming World?,"
On July 5, Jason Fung, the former CEO of TikTok's gaming division, made the announcement that he was leaving the company to found Meta0, a blockchain video game business.
Stating that he wanted to offer fresh solutions to video game producers, though, as an enterprise IT executive with a history that included considerable work for big organizations in the gaming sector.

Fung explained that the goal of Meta0 is to increase interoperability amongst the various blockchain networks so that developers are not restricted to using only a few of them for their projects.

""At the moment, every developer who wants to incorporate NFTs or blockchain technology into their games must select just one blockchain, be it Polygon, Solana, or Binance Smart Chain. 

Even though the collapse of the cryptocurrency market has significantly reduced interest in blockchain games, the sector still has a highly active community that is anxious to find a new project or a recovery in cryptocurrency prices to invest in their preferred video games once more.

However, NFT and blockchain games exploded in 2021, and this year the crypto gaming industry had already registered over $2.5 billion by Q1, 2022. 

The blockchain ecosystem is rapidly growing as cryptocurrency as means of payment is increasingly being adopted around the globe also diverse establishment across different industries such as Ferragamo, Gucci, Facebook are adopting NFTs and blockchain-based social media platforms which provide users more privacy and are censorship resistant such as Tok Lok App,  Steemit, peetah and indorse.io are increasingly becoming popular.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Ether whales get busy as transactions hit highest point since January,"Despite broad losses in the crypto market, Ether whales have been purchasing and trading Ethereum (ETH) the coin with the largest ecosystem over the likes of Quint and Solana;  at a rate not seen since January. 

On Wednesday, Ether whales performed 2,956 trades worth over $1 million, according to Santiment data, marking the largest day of whale transactions in nearly five months. Whales, according to Santiment, are defined as any account with a balance of $1 million to $10 million.

Despite the Terra-based contagion that continues to apply negative pressure on the market and public mood, the ETH/Bitcoin (BTC) combination continues to show relative strength. 

ETH/BTC hit a three-week high earlier this week, on May 6. According to Cointelegraph's market research, the paring indicates a possible breakout, especially as both Bitcoin and Ether approach what Santiment refers to as their ""historic buy zones."" 

Since the Beacon Chain went live, Ether has increased by approximately 250 percent against Bitcoin, signaling the start of its migration to proof-of-stake in December 2020. 

It isn’t just the Ether whales that have been busy either. According to data from Glassnode, Wednesday also marked the largest one-day transfer of Bitcoin from Whale Entities to exchanges.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Carlos Gomez, chief investment officer at Belobaba crypto hedge fund, said that this type of market activity may mean crypto investors are closer to the bottom of the current market dip than they realize.

Gomez said that the above graph shows a “clearly coordinated movement of most of the large holders in a specific 24-hour-window,” meaning that whales are continuing to hunt for weak hands.

Gomez added that it’s hard to say whether or not the bottom is well and truly in, but he suggested that “recent evidence shows that we’re not too far from it — the only thing is, we may have to live down here at these levels for a few weeks before going up again.”",0,2022-05-15 09:48:41,3
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Hybrid Exchange and Crowdfunding Platform on Concordium Blockchain: Introducing Bictory Finance,"With the series of solutions being offered by DeFi (Decentralized Finance) platforms, it is safe to say that DeFi has come to stay. This immensely successful, yet relatively new space has launched projects that have marked the paradigm shift in the crypto space towards a true and complete decentralized financial system. However, existing DeFi platforms are either focused on one of these elements, and not a holistic platform to provide an all-in-one financial solution for crypto projects.

In the wake of these developments, users want better solutions in the form of cheaper transaction fees, secure and super fast swaps, interoperable transactions, sleek and user-friendly designs, and most importantly, legally compliant level of privacy.

To solve these problems, the team came together to build [Bictory Finance](https://bictory.io/), a holistic solution to the DeFi space comprising a Centralized Exchange, Decentralized Exchange and a Crowdfunding Platform on Concordium Blockchain. This novel blockchain network was chosen technically on the basis of its high throughput, cheaper fees, identity and fast finality layer.

**The Components of Bictory Finance**

**Bictory Centralized Exchange**

The platform is designed based on an interactive and user-friendly interface that will enhance user experience. In addition to this, the exchange has been developed having in mind both crypto starters and experienced ones, hence, users can switch modes as to their level of understanding in the crypto space. The various modes of trades such as Spot, Margin etc. will be enabled on Bictory CEX.

Security is a major concern in this industry considering the series of thefts in the annals of this space. Bictory is keen on the utmost security for its users, especially because security is a major concern in this industry, Bictory engineers will never compromise on security. This is why we have built Bictory with the state-of-the art security systems. Additional security measures and authentications have also been embedded to ensure maximum security of funds on our platform.

**Bictory Decentralized Exchange**

DEXs have been the preferred option by users who want to trade without the daunting registration process, and rather not share personal details with centralized exchanges. Many crypto users have shared their concerns of network’s high fees when trading on Automated Market Makers like Sushiswap, Uniswap etc. Despite these ballooning fees, existing AMMs on the Ethereum network still take prolonged confirmation time, which can only be sped up with increasing gas fees.

We thought it is wise enough to develop a DEX on the Concordium Network for users who prefer using such trading platforms. The technology upon which Concordium Network was built upon makes it very cheap for trades and their finality layer ensures that transactions are confirmed in less than three seconds yet with very low fees. Users will get to enjoy trading on a very sleek user interface and well defined tabs to assist new traders navigate their way through Bictory Finance.

Another feature worth mentioning is our use of Proactive Market Making that will ensure that there is less slippage when users make transactions across our DEX.

Our developers have plans of building bridges that would allow for fluid, cross-chain interactions between popular networks such as Ethereum, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Avalanche, and other promising blockchains. The goal of Bictory Finance is to leverage hitch-free interoperability between various blockchains in a fast, decentralized, and cheap way.

**Bictory Crowdfunding Platform**

This funding substrate will take away all pressure points that entrepreneurs and developers go through when raising funds for their project. Bictory Finance, being the first Crowdfunding platform on Concordium will grow and expand and provide Bictory investors, entrepreneurs and our loyal community members numerous access to investment opportunities in early-stage projects seeking investment, right after they passed our internal audit.

We will be opening up our funding platforms as well, through our cross chain bridges that we plan to develop in the future. There will be support for Cross-Chain pools for public sales and our whitelisting process will be one of the easiest you might have come across.

IDO platforms like Balancer, Polkastarter, Bounce have all been plagued by bots which end up leaving tokens in a very few hands but with different wallets. Our unique Anti-bot measure and KYC system will ensure that all our users have a taste of investing in Initial Decentralized Offerings on our platform. Thanks to Concordium’s protocol-level identity layer, this will make participation secure, compliant and safe for all parties.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Alameda Went Broke, now Liquidators control $643 million of Solana (SOL)",,11,2022-11-30 05:22:24,4
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Goldman Sachs executive says SOL reminds him of ETH.,"Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal says one of Ethereum’s (ETH) top rivals offers a big opportunity to investors after a price fall.  


In a new strategy session video, the macro guru tells his 52,800 Youtube subscribers that Solana (SOL) has a lot working in its favor to ignite an eventual bull run.  


Pal says that despite some blockchain outages and the impacts of the FTX crypto exchange collapse, Solana appears strong due to its use case potential for brands and consumers.  


“I really like Solana and I understand that the chain breaks. I also understand that they are fixing it. I also understand that’s a no-no. And one of the elements was, it was concentrated in its ownership because of FTX. They are now able to liquidate it and so you’re getting rid of one of the issues.  


Solana itself, I think it’s doing something very clever. In cryptocurrencies, what matters is narrative. Bitcoin narrative, digital gold for example. Ethereum, the distributed Internet for Web3. So where do these other chains fit in? Well, Solana has and is building a narrative, which is that it is the consumer chain. And yes, there are some others doing that. FLOW, I think is another example, much smaller.""  


The present conditions in the crypto market are such that only Blockchain Finance, GameFi (Axie, God's Unchained, CosmoGene and new projects like LifeBeyond)  along with a couple of other projects seem to be doing just fine however the rest are still struggling and waiting to explode, we will see what the future holds for them.",10,2022-11-18 08:01:40,4
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,What triggered $SOL to $13,"It is obvious $SOL fall affected the community especially as it was unexpected. The recent turnaround of event on $SOL from $7 to $13 could be triggered by the first solana Dog meme coin. $BONK aims to support the solana community by airdropping 50% to the community and bringing back liquidity to the solana ecosystem. Since launching, the token has hit over $24 million daily trading volume and is now the top trending token on Coingecko and Twitter with interest from top CEX listing.

MEXC in its quest to list moon shot tokens very early was first to spot and list $BONK followed by Huobi and more CEX are expected to follow. As usual, many airdrop opportunities are available for users to benefit from. For example, MEXC has launched a referral for users to benefit from $10,000 worth of $BONK and a deposit to earn 2000 MX (The native token of the exchange).",1,2023-01-04 09:49:41,1

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and Cardano (ADA) Lead Altcoins Charge As 2021 Closes Its Curtains","[https://btcmanager.com/solana-sol-polkadot-dot-cardano-ada-altcoin-2021/](https://btcmanager.com/solana-sol-polkadot-dot-cardano-ada-altcoin-2021/)

Solana (SOL) has recorded high entries from its developers lately, surpassing the submission rates of [DOT](https://btcmanager.com/will-polkadot-and-huh-token-become-the-favourite-altcoins/) and ADA on Github. Per data from Santiment, Solana has had about 97 development entries on Github today. Cardano and Polkadot closely follow Solana in the year-end development activity analysis.

**Altcoins Increase Their Development Entries**

Per an analysis from crypto data tracker Santiment, Solana, Cardano, Polkadot, Ethereum, and Chainlink have recorded a lot of development activities lately. Solana has had quite a run this year, which saw it breaching its ATH and rank among the top 10 cryptos. 

The Q4 of 2021 started with meager daily development activities in the large-cap coins. On OCT. 29, 2021, almost all top 10 coins had less than ten development activities. Their development teams started incorporating new technologies, and the daily submission rates crawled back to normal. These developments are a good signal heading to the next year as some of the altcoins networks’ activities signal the crypto market’s anticipation for 2022.

**Solana Eclipses Daily Development Activities of Other Large Cap Cryptos**

In June 2021, Polkadot and Cardano had very high Github development submission rates. Both of these coins had more than 60 daily entries each. At the same time, Solana only had fewer than 50 daily entries. The two coins maintained the lead in daily development submissions on the github, while major cryptos had little to no activities in matters development. Nonetheless, the other digital currencies started registering a spike in their daily submission rates in Mid-August.

The daily developments were reduced by August but resumed vigorously in September. The whole of September was a busy month for developers as the daily submission rates for most coins were very high. At this time, ETH, DOT, and [ADA](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl) were the leader as SOL followed closely behind. It was not till towards Mid-October that the daily developments reduced.

After the number of development submissions on Github started rising in November, the Solana team began dominating. Their submissions rates competed with [DOT](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) and ADA. [SOL](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases) overtook ADA on NOV. 18 and almost caught up with DOT five days later. However, SOL came to overtake DOT on DEC. 11, 2021. Today, SOL has 97submissions while DoT has 77. ADA also follows closely with 66 submissions.

So   I found a really cool NFT with utility, and you even get some awesome   stuff just for being a holder. To start off everything is hand drawn,   and the art has been worked on for over 6 months, with a private   marketplace.  
There's a few devs that are involved with this Solana   project, and they're pretty attentive for the community throughout all   hours of the day. Early Access is filled, and completed a whitelist so   everyone is hype, and ready to go for this launch. Super fun community   to be part of

Cyber Pharmacy's   launch is Thursday, 10/07/21. Minting will be done through their   website. Their road map, and transparency updates has me excited for   whats to come. The hype recently from this NFT is that it will have a   free CBD/ wellness sample pack for the minters. You can even use this   NFT to access some of the best CBD and wellness brands.

The   main goal of Cyber pharmacy is more than a NFT, but to build a   community, and with being on the Solana network there will be fast   transactional times. With the consistent updates+ influencers, I'm on   board!

The roadmap has the following parts I'm most hyped about!

• NFT Holders VIP Verification 🚀

• Rarity Analysis Tool 🚀

•Arkane Royalty  🚀

•Founders Group 🚀

•Airdrops 🚀",2,2021-10-07 06:48:51,1
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Keep an eye on SOL and LUNA,"For the traders that keep funds in the sidelines, keep an eye on Solana and Terra. Both have reached price discovery and had some good retests over the last week. 

Both of these are going to be very good holds for the next few weeks. I'm sure most of you think ""yea, obviously those are good coins"" to that, but I wanted to make this post as a reminder to anyone looking to pack more bags or expand their portfolios. 

[SOL](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8ZNsyfr9/) shows the retest of all time high that just happened. And if you look at the [zoomed in chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/NnF8qyAl/) you can see a falling channel has broken out today. From this point, solana should steady climb with the possibility of making a parabolic move. 

[LUNA](https://www.tradingview.com/x/UNLK2HZo/) the dotted line on this chart is simply a perspective support level. I'd love for it to hold perfectly because it'll set luna up for a parabolic move. Regardless, it's still sitting on the previous ATH and is just loading for ore upside.

This is very basic TA and I'm not saying anything new here, but if you don't own solana or luna, I'd say you'd be very safe to expand your portfolio over to them for a nice mid-term hold.

I've realized I haven't added any targets to these charts, I'm on my phone now so not adding them now but when these start to move I can update the charts with realistic price targets.",1,2021-11-15 03:28:24,0

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Understanding Electra Protocol and Evoblox. Mini AMA Yesterday,"**Electra Protocol (ticker XEP):**

\- is NOT A TOKEN, so NO SMART CONTRACT ADDRESS.

\- is A COIN, with own blockchain (similar as BTC, ETH, SOL, LUNA, MATIC, AVAX, ALGO…)

\- will implement SMART CONTRACTS capability (inc. NFT…)

\- will implement Validator Nodes capability

\- is a non-security coin (no ICO…)

\- anyone can use the blockchain XEP to build solutions and products through a company

\- will have a foundation in which the premine will be handled by several persons (multi-sig)

**Evoblox :**

\- is a private company that will generate profits by selling solutions and services

\- is the first company that will use XEP as blockchain to support their solutions

\- will build custom solutions to fit with **real world enterprise** needs

\- is in relation with government entities (such as Panama)

\- is in relation with a Venture Capital (VC) to get funds (several millions of $, not yet signed as far as we know) in order to accelerate the development of the solutions and hire developers

**When and why XEP will moon? (considering Evoblox as the main entity that will be able to achieve this)**

\- VC must sign a contract with Evoblox and provide funds

\- Evoblox must sign contracts with enterprises/governments that want custom solutions using blockchain solutions (these contracts with generate revenues and benefits)

\- Evoblox must hire several skilled developers to implement and maintain theses custom solutions (using VC funds, and Evoblox revenues)

=> XEP will then be used (and bought) in real world. There **will be a buy pressure**, and price should increase.

**Why it should pump hard (beyond the moon)?**

\- Custom solutions that will use data will require **buying XEP**, and these XEPs will be **burned**!

\- Hypothesis: Evoblox should invest in XEP by buying continuously XEP using their benefits!

\- Speculation: Imagine Panama is the first country to use Evoblox solutions using XEP!

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Moving from a Culture of Crypto Volatility to Crypto Utility," The ongoing saga of the 2022 crypto crash saw another chapter written over the weekend when Bitcoin fell beneath $18,000, thereby breaking a hypothetical line of resistance pegged at its previous all-time high of $19,783 in 2017. As BTC plunged, other coins with leading market caps like ETH, ADA, XRP, and SOL were all dragged down to pre-pandemic lows as well. Meanwhile, a growing roster of multibillion dollar crypto entities–once considered the vanguard of the industry–have collapsed or are on the brink of insolvency, from the Luna Foundation Guard’s implosion in early May to Celsius Network’s a few weeks after, to Three Arrow Capital presently.

Despite the swirling FUD, it's important to bear in mind that crypto markets are not ebbing and flowing in isolation. The global macroeconomic backdrop has also dramatically worsened YTD as a number of interconnected issues–inflation, stagnant wages, rising interest rates, a rise in commodity prices, a global energy crunch, and fraying supply chains–have converged to force markets into bearish territory while sparking fears of a looming recession.

Watching the entire crypto market turn to deep red has forced some soul-searching as to what’s next. Most analysts are confident that BTC, ETH, and other leading coins will recover in the future. However, the current crash and the outflow of >$2T in assets from the crypto space YTD drives home the point that moving forward, something must change. After deep reflection, I’m increasingly convinced that this much-needed paradigm shift in the crypto culture will be a move by markets, investors, and institutions away from volatility and towards concrete crypto utility.

From the end of the last crypto supercycle to the current pullback, much of the crypto investment space has been characterized by a hyper-speculative culture that is essentially glorified gambling rather than strategic investment. The same volatility that generated million-percent gains for DOGE and SHIB holders has sucked hundreds of billions USD out of crypto assets in the last month alone, not to mention over two trillion dollars YTD. In this case, volatility is a double edged sword that ultimately confirms the old saying that, “what comes up must come down.”

Instead of idolizing volatility and the thrill of potentially limitless upside (and by extension, potential downside all the way back to zero), crypto markets and asset holders need to embrace a new mindset and investment culture that will help promote long-term viability. That new outlook was nailed by CZ\_Binance (CEO of Binance) in a Tweet from Saturday June 18th where he writes: “Utility value has staying power.” And I might add that by definition, volatility does not.

The viral Tweet thread received over 14k likes overnight, and points to a very real alternative for the crypto universe as it recovers from the current bear cycle, i.e. one that prioritizes real-world crypto/blockchain utility over the ability of a otherwise-functionless altcoin to generate six-digit marginal returns overnight.

BTC, ETH, and the other big-ten coins will almost certainly recover from the current pullback. But the same is not true for the hundreds of altcoins that plummeted to zero in recent weeks. What will take their place are providers of blockchain utility–products, goods, and services–that are in demand for their added value rather than promises of double-digit passive yields or infinite investment upside.

Crypto utility can come in all shapes and sizes, and is diverse as the blockchain industry itself. One strong and concrete example of crypto utility is the emerging crypto payment service providers and gateways, which can be thought of as the “blockchain” iteration of the revolution in social payment apps (think Venmo) that hit the market a decade ago. The case for the utility of crypto payments is easy to make, given the industry standard currently offered by traditional banks is slow, expensive, and encumbered by red tape. Crypto payments can be executed faster, farther, and for cheaper than any international wire transfer or remission service at least I know of, which means they have the potential to be of real, everyday value to users.

Different companies penetrating this niche are slowly creating a competitive and diverse market. A leader in the field is Bitpay, which is based in the US and offers a range of products and services for streamlined crypto payments between individuals and businesses. Oobit occupies a similar niche in that it recently launched a B2B2C payments app for use worldwide. It has also launched a centralized utility token–OBT–for rewards and rebates within its broader payments ecosystem. Utrust is another crypto payments innovator that focuses on e-commerce merchants and like Oobit, it also has an associated utility token, UTK.

In different ways, Bitpay, Oobit, and Utrust all provide added value through leveraging crypto utility rather than crypto volatility. That means enabling a guest worker to convert their paycheck into crypto and then send it home across the world in seconds at no cost. It means allowing college kids to pay for tuition and textbooks in BTC. It means creating seamless, contactless crypto payment options for retail in a post-pandemic world. It means keeping expectations realistic, and exploring how crypto utility can be utilized to create a better world rather than enriching the few and impoverishing the many.

Crypto payment solutions are just one example of the potential blockchain technology has to revolutionize the global financial system. Be it payment solutions, smart contracts, or the concept of digital scarcity created by NFTs–blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are already fundamentally redefining the way the world works. In step with that tectonic shift, we need to move beyond a culture of crypto speculation and volatility towards one of long-term value accruement and everyday utility.",25,2022-06-22 10:09:03,17

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Ethereum lost almost 20% of its market cap since the Merge upgrade,"I am sure that a lot of us expected a big boom in the ETH price after the merge, we all hoped for a tremendous rise in the price, but today things are a bit different...  


However, with the prevailing market downturn, the initial stages of the Merge have failed to live up to the expectations with the asset recording capital outflow.   


At the same time, the capital outflows are reflected in Ethereum’s price, which has steadily plunged while struggling to stay above $1,300.  


Could this somehow affect the price of gas fees? What will happen with that? I'm using Metis for this issue, I knew that PoS won't change that, but will the price of gas fees rise like crazy in the future? We don't know, not yet.  


What do you think about that?  


The Merge was expected to drive more interest in Ethereum after the network officially transitioned to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol. The upgrade is meant to make Ethereum a deflationary asset and potentially attract institutional capital.   


So, does this actually mean that merge fails to meet expectations?",6,2022-10-03 17:53:00,15
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Top 5 best-performing cryptocurrencies by returns in 2022,"Which cryptocurrency surprised you the most this year? Asking since the cryptocurrency market has suffered several significant setbacks during 2022, but some of its assets have performed better than others, particularly in terms of returns per month, a new yearly report has revealed.  


Specifically, the top five best-performing assets in 2022 were TRX, XMR, BNB, ETC, and DOGE, as per the new ‘State of the Network’ report by the blockchain analytics platform CoinMetrics published on December 20.  


What is your plan for 2023, have you thought about some investment plans?  


People need to understand that DYOR is crucial even if you actually can never be absolutely sure in terms of crypto. I know it can be challenging for beginners but maybe projects like Coin Fantasy made the right decision in deciding to use games to introduce people to cryptocurrencies by creating the world's first decentralized fantasy trading platform for cryptocurrency markets for both new and experienced traders. This could help beginners enter the world of cryptocurrency.  


On the bottom of the chart, LUNA recorded a 100% loss of returns in May, after which the tracking stopped with the implosion of the Terraform Labs ecosystem that also led to the de-pegging of Terraform’s stablecoin TerraUSD.  


Another loser is FTT, the native token of the crypto exchange FTX, the collapse of which resonated across the crypto industry, culminating in the arrest of its founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. FTT suffered a 95% decline in returns in November, followed by a slowdown and a 22% drop in December.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Let's say the government limited your Crypto holdings to a max of five tokens, which tokens would you hold on to?","
While we could be quick to shove this aside as impossible, I'd like to say that with the coming regulations on crypto, just about anything is possible.

A couple years ago, nobody would have expected to pay taxes on crypto, but amazingly, it's happening in several nations already. Spain for instance is working on a regulation which would make every crypto investor disclose your Crypto holdings. What this means is that anything and everything is possible when it comes to possible regulations from the government. 

So taking a critical look at your current crypto portfolio which possibly consists of the projects listed below. 
The two majors: Bitcoin and Ether and all/some of these

$SOL: because you believe it would turn out to be the real ""Ethereum killer""

$GMT: being a pioneer in the move-to-earn category

$TOL token: as the native Token for the secured TokLok messenger app which you expect to soar

$BNB: since you believe so much in CZ and Binance 

$OP: You believe in optimism' layer 2 project

And maybe a 

$FTT: because you see Sam Bankman-Fried as a business mogul with some brain

So if the government limited an individual's holding to a maximum of 5 tokens, which tokens in your portfolio would you hodl and why that choice?",11,2022-06-29 18:59:27,10

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,What we should expect from Solana in 2023?,"We are all aware that the failure of FTX and Alameda Research had a particularly negative impact on the capitalization of the cryptocurrency, and the Solana investor is also aware of this.   


But are programmers avoiding cryptocurrency as well?  


I've heard that in 2022, the number of active developers of Solana's software fell by more than 90%.  


Sam Bankman-Fried was able to injure the altcoin more than the network outages that the cryptocurrency has had over the past two years since he was a big proponent of Solana.  


Solana is well known for being a key player in NFTs. In fact, behind Ethereum, it has the second-largest market in this sector. Additionally, one of the most well-known markets for NFTs is the altcoin market.  


Even though I was a major fan of SOL, I want to focus more on projects like Coin Fantasy and like ones in the upcoming year because you never know which one might catch on.  


The SOL network's creators were a crucial source of assistance. After the Bitcoin meltdown, they continued to run their business, and it is currently unknown if they are still doing so more than a month after FTX declared bankruptcy.",11,2022-12-27 17:35:44,3
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,We can’t integrate DeFi into our financial systems as long as its not sustainable,"When creating and designing cryptocurrencies and blockchain, i’m more than sure the impact on the environment wasn’t taken into consideration. 

Because as time passes we’re learning more and more about how DeFi is negatively impacting our environment, and how Bitcoin uses more energy than some countries. 

Which is why this year some projects are aiming to go carbon negative, and we’re also seeing the rise of new projects that are focusing on sustainability. 

One example is the Greenhouse DEX that builds and drives liquidity for layer-one blockchains, bridges and partnering projects.",10,2022-04-20 07:29:10,12
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Solana's price soars as a whale move half a million tokens,"I'm happy to see that the market is trading in green today as Bitcoin and other Altcoins are still seeing a jump today despite the collapse of three major U.S. banks last week.   
 

I've read that significant amounts of SOL and MATIC tokens were transferred between various wallets. According to blockchain data, an unknown wallet transferred 537,352 SOL tokens worth 10,743,976 USD to Coinbase, a popular crypto exchange.   
 

Another notable transfer occurred when 11,983,053 MATIC tokens worth 14,104,719 USD were sent from Polygon to an unknown wallet.   
 

In a separate transaction, two unknown wallets transferred a massive amount of MATIC tokens to Binance, another prominent crypto exchange. The first wallet transferred 30,000,000 MATIC tokens, equivalent to 35,330,121 USD, while the second wallet transferred 30,000,000 MATIC tokens, worth 35,388,676 USD.   
 

I must track these events and prices on Toshi Tools since Solana's price soars by 13.26% in the last 24 hours and each SOL token is trading for 21.82 USD.    
 

The market cap for this crypto is currently at 8.35 billion USD. Trading volume is up by 22.52% over the last day. Solana has seen a rise of 4.29% in the last 30 days, trading as high as $26.93. Over the past 7 days, the token has seen a growth of 8.00%",7,2023-03-15 19:31:49,0

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Will Solana's price continue to surge after the explosive price rally?,"What do you make of the most recent report that Solana's price has increased by 45% in the past week?  


I'm expecting to hear more good news since I believe that this year will be the year of recovery of the crypto market, I've already found some great platforms and projects, and CoinFantasy is probably one of them on which I plan to spend most of the time.  


When it comes to SOL, after reaching an annual low of $8 in December, the coin had this notable comeback. The coin lost 1.6% over the past day, showing that SOL was consolidating following a period of explosive rallying.  


Major cryptocurrencies also observed northbound price activity as Bitcoin continued to rebound. The coin's technical outlook has also shown that bullish strength is growing on the chart. The coin has experienced significant accumulation, and during the past week, demand has skyrocketed.  


The altcoin was currently inside the overbought zone, which indicates that buyers have entirely taken over the market. A coin typically experiences a correction following a rally, and the price of Solana may be doing the same.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"2030 Coin Prediction: Cardano (ADA) Leads Twitter Polls by 82%, Will It Really Be The Biggest Of The Lot?","CoinQuora reported earlier today on the Twitter poll by the crypto community on May 18, 2022, where ADA leads by quite some margin getting 82% of votes over three other altcoins. 

 A Twitter user with 26.7k followers ran a poll requesting people to vote for the coin they believe will remain until 2030. Along with ADA, they listed Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Algorand (ALGO). At the time of writing, 12,983 Twitter users voted. 82% of the respondents favored Cardano’s ADA, while only 3% picked Avalanche.  But some of the guys replying to the post expressed zero confidence in the four listed tokens. Citing the disastrous implosion of Terra (LUNA). 

They said their conviction remains with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).  While it is impractical to tell which coin is the next Bitcoin, experts have parameters in place to vet the sustainability of a crypto project.

 The sustainability of a coin may be from its use cases, team, web presence, community, etc.  Nonetheless, every cryptocurrency has a reason to exist. It may exist as a payment method like USDC, or a utility token, like Solana, to verify transactions on a blockchain or a reward token like $Solis which is used to return value to content creators.

 The idea is that an absence of a use case for a coin strongly indicates something fishy. Do you think ADA is right up there?",0,2022-05-20 19:31:13,9
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Web3 Obstacles & How to Overcome Them in 2022,"Source: [https://medium.com/@Pointnetwork/web3-obstacles-how-to-overcome-them-in-2022-8191a6f26461](https://medium.com/@Pointnetwork/web3-obstacles-how-to-overcome-them-in-2022-8191a6f26461) 

&#x200B;

In April 2021, over[ 530 million Facebook users’](https://www.identityforce.com/blog/2021-data-breaches) data, including their names, locations, phone numbers, email addresses, and biographical information, was posted online for free. Another crucial and saddening statistic also shows that the number of breaches in the U.S has significantly[ increased in the last decade](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273550/data-breaches-recorded-in-the-united-states-by-number-of-breaches-and-records-exposed/) from about 662 in 2010 to more than 1,000 by 2021.

It’s no wonder that[ 74 % of internet users in the United States](https://legaljobs.io/blog/privacy-statistics/) are as worried about their online privacy today as they have ever been, and[ 79 % of internet users around the world](https://legaljobs.io/blog/privacy-statistics/) have agreed that they feel somewhat incapable of control of their data.

Web3 promises to be the future of the internet. It promises to restore data into the hands of its owners and give them full control over decisions regarding their data.

Despite the big promises and future web3 presents to users, many obstacles hinder mass adoption of it. Let’s discuss these obstacles in more detail.

**COMPLEX UI**

The user interface of most web3 applications can be complex and difficult to navigate, from setting up a wallet, connecting your wallet, purchasing crypto, or even providing liquidity and staking.

This complex user interface is one turn-off for new users as they get overwhelmed, leading to a bad experience. Most web3 apps are built to focus on the technical people while neglecting the needs of the less technical users, which isn’t going to lead to fast adoption.

The UI of Web3 applications can be better if the companies concerned pay more attention to how their designs influence the onboarding of users, especially beginners. A good UI can increase customer acquisition. Grants should also be offered to designers to develop different designs sent to the developers for implementation.

**SECURITY & TRUST**

How will web3 projects ensure these security concerns are appropriately addressed? How safe are the smart contracts on which most web3 apps are built? With web 2.0, users are familiar with 2-factor authentication and SSL security as methods of staying safe. The security standards of web3 aren’t familiar to most users yet.

Web3 projects should be taking the security of their users as their first priority and ensure to communicate this to users in the easiest way through all available platforms.

As with any new project, people are yet to trust the authenticity of web3. With much false information about web3 and even different projects claiming to support web3 but falling short in other areas, it is harder but not impossible to get the trust of people.

The issue of trust can be tackled by being transparent with users. Always ensure you warn users about possible risks and how to avert them.

**SCALABILITY & GAS FEES**

Scalability is a hindrance to web3 adoption. For transactions to be confirmed on the blockchain, users must pay gas fees. The gas fees paid on the Ethereum network can soar into hundreds of dollars, making it unaffordable for ordinary users.

While popular blockchains are prone to scalability issues, newer blockchains have been developed to address this issue. Web3 projects can leverage the benefits of these new blockchains that provide faster transaction speeds and low gas fees to provide seamless services to users

**POOR EDUCATION & MARKETING**

For most new products, users need to learn how to use them before delving into using them. The same happens in web3. Users need to know about blockchains and how they work: smart contracts, protocols, wallets, etc. Most users can find it confusing to understand, hence giving up on web3.

Poor marketing also contributes to this as most web3 companies focus more on building their projects without spending much time analyzing how to market this to the public in a simple and clear manner. Web3 education and marketing should cut across different technical experiences, be it beginners, intermediate or expert users of web3.

Web3 projects can adopt the following educational ideas:

* The use of long-form blog posts to educate the online audience about web3, its advantages, and how it works
* Video content, infographics, ebooks, podcasts, and other types of content should be released for educational purposes.
* Participation in webinars, AMAs, and spaces should be encouraged
* Offline events and meetups should be organized to enlighten the offline audience and also create a bond among web3 users
* Social media also plays an essential role in web3 education and should not be overlooked.

Conclusion

Web3 is still in its infancy stage, and we are yet to see its full benefits. If the issues that hinder the adoption of web3 are addressed, users are sure to have a smooth ride and see faster adoption in the future.",7,2022-04-22 13:04:40,9

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,InfiniteTwo IF2,"InfiniteTwo a second project from InfiniteOne

We have made a token that rewards you in BNB just for holding it

12% tax on all transactions
5% to BNB Dividends
3% To Liquidity
3% To Marketing/Admin
1% To do a monthly purchase of a partner token and distribute to IF2 holders only. 

InfiniteTwo is designed to reward holders with BNB instead of normal reflections. You are free to use this BNB to invest in anything you want. More InfiniteTwo or just take the money and save it up for something for yourself.

A very simple idea to reward holders with extra money. The higher the value of InfiniteTwo becomes the more BNB we can collect and pass on to the holders.   

As we all know any project will become stagnant if it only has tunnel vision. We will be including a NFT project that will link back to InfiniteOne Project. This will allow holders of either IF1 or IF2 to be able to buy the NFTs to use on multiple platforms for bonuses and games. Depending on the project IF1 has partnered with. 

We decided the best way to make InfiniteOne stronger was to create a second token that provides rewards in a different way. InfiniteOne has been a successful project with steady growth over the past 4-5 months. Now we want to provide a way for holders to get some BNB so they can invest in what they want not just projects we partner with. As a Holder of IF2 you will receive BNB every 24hrs based on volume of transactions. This means if we are having a low volume day it could take longer for you to receive your rewards. However, they will not stop accumulating. When paid out the 24hr clock will reset. With this said if you see you have enough pending you can trigger the transaction with a small buy or sale of IF2 and the 24hr clock will reset.

With IF2 we will be pushing the marketing a lot harder as this project relies on volume of transactions. We will be getting it listed on CMC ASAP and pushing the marketing of it harder to drive volume to it.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,BOBZcoin Manifesto: the Future of ‘Sick’ Entertainment,"In the early days of the 2020 pandemic a small bar in Long Island took a leap of faith into macabre, sinister entertainment. This leap was a rudimentary betting pool on whether Chicago or NYC would experience greater gun violence over the Labor Day weekend. It garnered local media attention, and a fair amount of outrage, the authorities attempted to shut it down, but failed. Bobzcoin wishes to expand on that story, allowing its users to place bets not only on gun violence, but violence of all causes, overdose deaths, terrorist attacks, when and where the next school massacre will occur, vehicle related deaths and Wars etc….

Coin Functionality

Betting on Bodies will have a peer-to-peer betting system, one where any two parties can take bets on gun violence, or other categories that are outside the mainstream and would be considered morally precarious. Users will have the ability to bet against one another utilizing a secure p2p protocol., e.g. All funds associated with a bet will be placed in a secure wallet controlled by the administrators, this will allow us to expediently distribute funds to the winners and ensure that parties do not back out of a wager. The administrators will charge a small holding fee, no more than 10% of each wager.

Tokenomics

When a user purchases a BOBzcoin via pancakeswap, they will receive 85% of the value purchased. 15% of their purchase will be allocated as follows: 10% is sent to a secure wallet held by the BOBzCoin team, this will be used exclusively for Development, Marketing and Management. 3% of every purchase will be allocated to our holders. The amount each holder receives will be based on the amount of BOBzcoin they currently hold, the more a holder possesses the greater the amount received. This 3% is often referred to as a ‘user tax’. 2% will be burned in a secure wallet. When coins are burned at a controlled and steady pace, this gradually increases the value of a coin. 

Ethos

While the self-righteous, pretentious crowd of clowns may attempt to cancel or drown us out, they fail to grasp the true nature of humanity. We enjoy watching others suffer, we relish violence, we embrace chaos. Most of us are constrained by the shackles of mundane lives, insipid relationships and a life trajectory that offers little in the realm of invigorating excitement, Bobzcoin will capitalize on our darkest impulses. Bobzcoin will not judge those who want to see others fall victim to gun violence, we will not cancel those who express violent desires, we will never view something as too violent to indulge. 

As we all engage in the perpetual rat race imposed on us by modern western society, we fall further into the abyss of a cultureless environment, dominated by concentrated wealth held by a small number of corporate conglomerates, buttressed by a corrupt government. These institutions are not there to help us or protect us, they exist only to further enrich a decadent and hedonistic ruling class. As power and autonomy has slipped from the grasp of the everyday normie and eccentric autist, the BOBZcoin community wishes to expose the absurdity and cruelty of modern society.

Cancelling cancel culture is one prominent object we seek to achieve. By normalizing and embracing the worst aspects of humanity we will render the superficial and manufactured virtue of the ruling elite null and void. How can one stomach the twisted ideology of modern society, individuals have had their livelihoods destroyed, families broken apart and thrust into the oblivion and indignation of cancellation by expressing views that do not adhere to a narrow and perverse mainstream narrative. Canceling someone is a death sentence. You are not abruptly or with immediate effect ending their existence, but you strip them of their financial support, ability to communicate (as the majority of information mediums are controlled by major conglomerates), and lastly, they are robbed of their dignity. Deaths from despair have grown exponentially over the past decade, this is not a coincidence, this is a direct ramification of the exploitation that the ruling class enforces and then demands we emulate on a micro level, via the perpetual rat race.

Why BOBZcoin will work

The world is quickly descending into rapid, irreparable disrepair. Wars are ubiquitous, the environment is inhospitable, supply chains are strained exacerbated by growing geopolitical tensions, and societies are being torn apart by socio economic and demographic changes. All this chaos will lead to one constant, Violence! Death, Destruction and Chaos will only go up, like a stock promoted by the apes on Wall Street Bets, there will be nothing to stop the indomitable rise of BobzCoin. 

Per all the reasons listed above, people are irate, pent-up frustration is ready to explode. The elites want us to remain silent, to suffer and accept their positions of power as warranted, as opposed to stolen. We know that is Bullshit! As this perverse society tears itself apart, let's set aside the virtue signaling and embrace violence. People want this, people want to become Bobbers, they want to watch this sick society burn down! Therefore BOBZcoin will work. Let’s shoot to the moon, while the clowns and sycophants shoot each other.",1,2022-04-22 07:32:48,8

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,The cryptocurrency market is characterized by cycles of projects claiming to be giant killers,"You probably noticed how the cryptocurrency market is characterized by cycles of projects claiming to be giant killers. Altcoins that were said to be used for everyday money, for example, appeared in the early history of Bitcoin.  


All of these cryptocurrencies were founded on the premise that they were faster and had lower fees than BTC, but this did not allow these projects to gain widespread traction.  


Ethereum was the altcoin that truly made an impact in the cryptocurrency world. This currency immediately wowed me because it wasn't even attempting to be a ""Bitcoin killer,"" as most cryptos did. Ethereum brought smart contracts to the blockchain world, paving the way for important industry trends like DeFi and NFTs.  


Once Ethereum became popular, it ran into some issues, such as slowness and high fees when its network is forced. As a result, many ETH assassins, including Solana, have emerged.  


And yet thanks to Metis and L2 solutions, which come in handy in these situations, I was able to deal with that issue.  


The cryptocurrency employs a hybrid consensus model of PoS and PoH to ensure scalability. It also has a low transaction cost because it is designed to keep fees for apps with billions of users as low as possible.  


These characteristics would undoubtedly make Solana a formidable competitor for Ethereum. However, history repeats itself, and a project claiming to be a ""killer"" of its predecessor continues to lose market share.  


In 2022, Solana, like other cryptocurrencies, experienced a sharp correction. The altcoin has dropped by more than 90% since its all-time high in November 2021. In the early months of cryptocurrency, network outages on the smart contracts platform were common.  


Many users claim that SOL isn't particularly innovative; what are your thoughts? Is it safe to assume that Solana will be the next cryptocurrency to fail?",9,2022-11-24 15:58:53,0

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Hypothetical question that may not be so hypothetical.....NFA," There has been a huge dip since late last year in most coins, the ones I focus on being the top 20 or so. The dips have ranged from ROUGHLY 30% to up to 65%, not necessarily from all time highs either.

Its commonly known id say that in general when a bull market resumes it is led by Bitcoin (now closely followed by ETH) to then be followed a little later on, possibly through investment of profits taken, by the lower cap alts (again, specific to the top 20 or so, think SOL/ADA/MATIC/DOT etc...).

Having looked, those lower cap alts have taken a harder hit, percentage wise, than BTC and ETH from ATHs and in most time frames in the last year.

Here comes the..... HYPOTHETICALLY, with investment into the top 20 alts, some of which are mentioned above, having been hit harder, would it still make sense to move funds to ETH and BTC in the hope they run first, to then put profits back into the alts before they do their thing.

This is all a hypothetical question and NFA of course, just wondering what the sub thought might hold a more profitable outcome:

* Leaving pre-invested funds in top 20 alts
* Moving funds from top 20 alts which have been hit lower, over to ETH/BTC to try and catch both run ups of these followed by smaller caps

NFA just curious

Edit: option two obviously carries the extra risk of when to sell/swap",1,2022-06-07 12:33:09,6

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Staking VS Trading: Pros and Cons,"As the popularity and legitimacy of cryptocurrencies grow, more and more people perceive them as a way of earning money. There are several methods of raising capital. Some require knowledge and effort from the user and some only time. This article will look at two popular earning methods, analyze their pros and cons, and help you choose the one that suits you.  


### Are You Active or Passive?

Even before you buy a cryptocurrency, you need to decide how you want to increase your portfolio. That is, to go into profit. There are several ways:

* to invest to trade (sell/buy and earn on price fluctuations);
* invest in top coins and hold them until the profit on its sale seems satisfactory;
* invest in coins to earn interest: staking or lending.

It is crucial to decide on a strategy before the first purchase of cryptocurrency: because it will depend, banal, on how much time per week you will devote to tracking the exchange rate. And if you are determined not to lose money, then you understand the importance of such awareness.  


### Choose the Asset Wisely

Evaluate the crypto assets you want to buy. First, you must give the cryptocurrency you want to buy your definition. And obviously, the first thing you need to understand is whether it is a reliable asset. To do this, answer several very simple questions:

* How long has this cryptocurrency been on the market?
* Have there been bright ups and downs during this time? When and against what background did this happen? Media monitoring is needed here. This is important if you don’t want to “point your finger at the sky.” Thus, you will now understand whether something significant influences a particular crypto asset. So that, if you still choose an asset, you can understand for the future what it can “storm” from and what news to track.
* Does any influencer directly affect this asset? For example, Elon Musk, the Winklevoss brothers, Michael J. Saylor, and so on.
* Was the cryptocurrency’s price able to recover or reach new all-time highs after the fall?
* Does the asset have liquidity on the exchange where you trade?
* What are the trading volumes on the coin — the higher, the better. Low trading volumes mean that the asset is not available on many platforms, or traders are not interested in it. 

### Crypto Trading  Explained

Trading on the crypto exchange requires knowledge and skills that come from many months of practice. Getting to know trading should start with an overview of the main tools. When opening a trading terminal on any crypto exchange, you will see approximately the same set of tools: a price chart for the selected trading pair, an order book, information on trading volumes, and transaction history. You need to read charts, analyze them, have fundamental and technical analysis skills, analyze crypto market sentiment, and track the news background.

Many exchanges provide a demo account where you can practice and try out new strategies. The principle of operation is similar to real trading, so it is strongly recommended that every beginner first test their strength in this way. This will allow you to understand the terminology and essential tools.

In addition to the usual trading, the essence of which boils down to “buy cheaper and sell more expensive”, other varieties are especially popular during periods of a bearish trend and allow you to make money even during falling markets. For example, futures trading is a kind of betting on whether the rate will go up or down after a particular time. Or margin trading — this opportunity is now provided by almost all well-known crypto exchanges. In this case, the platform provides users with leverage in an amount several times higher than the amount the trader possesses. In this way, you can significantly increase your profit, but keep in mind that the risks are also growing.

### Trading Strategies

If you intend to trade, you need to understand how active: weekly, daily, or every minute. It is mandatory to be able to read an order book. It would also be nice to understand indicators and chart patterns. Analyze whether whales operate and whether market making takes place. Also, analyze market sentiment, that is, who dominates bulls or bears.

Among other things, knowledge of technical and fundamental analysis is required from the trader:

* Technical analysis. A forecasting method based on the study of past asset quotes. It is believed that the dynamics of the cryptocurrency exchange rate are cyclical. The growth and fall in demand for BTC and altcoins occur according to the same patterns. To identify these recurring situations, users look for patterns on the chart of a trading pair, determine the support and resistance levels, and try to predict reversal points using Elliott waves or Fibonacci levels.
* Fundamental analysis. It is based on studying economic, political, and news prerequisites for changing quotes. To trade using this method, users follow the news, and speeches of major investors and politicians, evaluate the prospects of cryptocurrencies, compare their technical characteristics, and analyze the economic situation and sentiment in other markets (stock, commodity, currency).

Trading can be both short-term, medium-term, and long-term. Day traders or scalpers who open a lot of orders within one trading day are more focused on technical analysis. Due to the short time intervals, transactions of day traders and scalpers usually bring a small profit, less than 1%. Medium-term and long-term traders typically focus on fundamental analysis. Technical analysis is used only as an addition that eliminates unnecessary noise in price fluctuations and helps find the optimal market entry points. Trades are carried out less frequently than with scalping. The order can remain open for up to several weeks. At the same time, the user can expect a high income from each trade.  


### How Much Can You Earn?

You can both earn a lot and lose all your funds. Trading requires experience and involves high risks. Trading is much riskier than staking: a trader makes a lot of trades, which is why he incurs more costs for fees. And if the cumulative losses exceed the total profit, the deposit will be reset very quickly.  


### Trading: Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* High potential profit. Cryptocurrencies are very volatile, sometimes allowing traders to earn significant amounts in just one day.
* Low entry threshold. It is enough to make the first trade on the market to have only $10. This is the average size of the minimum order on the crypto exchange. However, it is better to start trading at least $100 so that there is always a reserve of free money in case you need to average a position or buy another crypto asset.
* There is no payback time. You don’t need to buy expensive equipment, as in the case of mining, count interest on loans, or lock your assets for specific time periods.
* Thanks to futures and margin trading, there is an opportunity to earn both on the growth and the fall of cryptocurrencies.

**Cons**

* High risks. Where there is a large profit, there are high risks. Moreover, the risks are always directly proportional to the potential profitability. When trading with leverage, the risks only grow.
* Constant training and discipline. Trading is a full-fledged, extremely resource-intensive work. Traders need to learn and analyze their mistakes constantly.  


### Crypto Staking Explained

Cryptocurrency staking is the voluntary locking of one’s assets for the purpose of passive income. Staking is available in blockchains using Proof of Stake and its varieties, for example, Delegated PoS (Tron, Cosmos, etc.) or Liquid PoS (Tezos). Classic solo staking has a high entry threshold. For example, to become a solo staker on the Ethereum network, you will need at least 32 ETH (about $60,000) and a computer connected to the internet \~24/7. However, users can deposit a smaller amount into the staking pools, thus delegating coins to validators. This way, they do not need to run their own node, but the profit will be less. The disadvantage of the staking pool: if this pool does not sign the block, the user may not receive a reward.  


### Staking Types

The main principle of staking is universal for all its types — a certain amount of cryptocurrency is on the user’s account, for which he receives passive income. The amount of capital determines the level of profit. Also, the operation mechanism can be supplemented by other conditions that depend on the type of staking. For example, some systems provide payments only to validators. Then, stakeholders sometimes combine assets, creating pools and becoming validators, and draw up a common contract. The profit is divided among the pool participants in multiples of the contribution size.

* **Locked Staking**

With this type of staking, the user locks his assets for a specific period. The duration of this period cannot be changed. The main advantage of this type is the high-interest rate. Usually, the APR that the staker will receive at the end of the specified period is indicated in advance, but the reward may vary. Locked staking is characterized by high profitability compared to other types of staking.

* **Flexible Staking**

In this case, the contract does not provide a specific period of holding coins. The user, at will, can terminate it at any time and withdraw the cryptocurrency. The interest is accrued until the staker transfers the funds to another wallet or places an order in exchange for the sale of tokens. Earnings, in this case, are insignificant (from 1% to a maximum of 20% per year). Flexible staking is suitable for users who are not ready for long-term agreements on the retention of cryptocurrencies and want permanent access to their capital.

* **Cold Staking**

The most secure option. The locking of cryptocurrencies occurs on a hardware wallet that does not have a permanent Internet connection. This option is not available for all coins and trading platforms. In addition, the coins must always be located at the same address. In case of relocation, the contract is terminated, and the reward is not paid.

Cold staking is relevant for owners of large volumes of coins that do not want to risk their loss in the event of a crypto exchange being hacked.

* **Liquid Staking**

Liquid staking allows token holders to stake their tokens, forcing them to work in DeFi. This is the best of both worlds: Staking and DeFi, with no cryptocurrency lock-up periods, which can sometimes take up to 28 days. Liquid staking solves the incompatibility crisis between DeFi chains by allowing the use of derivative assets in DeFi protocols to generate income and staking rewards, helping to unlock liquidity locked in PoS networks. One of the most popular liquid staking platforms is the Lido. The protocol allows you to stake ETH, SOL, MATIC, DOT, and KSM. After adding tokens to the staking pool, the user receives a similar number of derivative tokens (for example, if you deposit 1000 ETH, you will receive 1000 stETH). Further, stETH can be used as a regular ETH, for example, to generate income in other DeFi protocols. The crucial point is that the staker receives a staking reward and additional income for using stTokens in DeFi protocols.

* **DeFi Staking**

DeFi staking is not exactly staking in its traditional sense. With the help of DeFi staking, users can stake not only PoS blockchain tokens but also PoW, such as BTC, LTC, USDT, USDC, and others. In the DeFi staking, there are counterparties — platforms that take your coins at interest. At the same time, the security of the transaction is provided by a smart contract and completely depends on the presence or absence of vulnerabilities in it. Many platforms offer DeFi staking services. For example, the well-known crypto exchange Binance allows you to stake 15 assets, including BTC, ETH, USDT, DAI, and other major coins. The exchange acts as a showcase and cooperates with several leading DeFi protocols, such as Venus, Aave, dYdX, and others. Users can deposit tokens for a floating or locked period, after which the Binance redirects the deposited amount to one of the DeFi protocols to generate profit.   


### How Much Can You Earn?

It is impossible to give an exact number: the interest may vary depending on the selected token. Also, note that if you stake tokens using third-party platforms, the profitability varies from platform to platform. It should also be understood that you can not just earn a little but even lose a lot in some cases.

For example, you bought $1000 worth of the coin and staked it at 100% APR. However, this does not mean that in a year, you will get $2000. The profit will depend on the exchange rate of the coin. If it remains at the same level, your profit will double. If the exchange rate has increased, the earnings will be even more. But if the coin has dropped significantly in price, then, in the end, you may be left with only $100-200, depending on the depth of the fall.

Risks are present, as in any other type of investment. But even here, they can be minimized. Stablecoins will help in this. The most famous are USDT, BUSD, and USDC. There are platforms within which you can earn up to 10-20% APR for the staking stablecoins.

### Staking: Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* Minimal risks of losing funds, especially when it comes to stablecoin staking.
* Passive income. The user earns simply for depositing their tokens into the staking pool. Moreover, the yield is higher than that of any bank deposit.
* Large stakeholders receive voting power and can participate in the project's further development.
* You do not need to have special knowledge and skills.
* Stocking types: locked, flexible, liquid, and DeFi staking.

**Cons**

* Loss in the price of a digital asset. The more the exchange rate of the coin decreases, the smaller the amount of interest specified in the contract will be. This is especially acute when concluding a contract for a locked term. Noticing a sharp price decrease, the user will be unable to sell the asset.
* Relatively low profitability by the standards of the crypto market.

### Closing Thoughts

In this article, we have considered two ways of earning — trading and staking. Trading is an active way of earning money. In other words, a full-fledged job requires the user to have deep technical knowledge, constant involvement, risk management skills, market sentiment analysis, news background, and much more. Trading involves great risks, but this method can bring the biggest profit. On the other hand, staking is a passive type of earnings that does not require much knowledge, time, and effort. At the same time, staking is not so risky and is more regarded as a way to get little extra earnings.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Could this be the bottom for BTC?,"It's apparent that bullish signals have formed for bitcoin, implying that the price will continue to rise toward the widely followed 200-day simple moving average (SMA). BTC has grown from $38,500 to $42,200 in the last three days, according to the daily chart. Positive indications from technical instruments like stochastics and MACD (moving average convergence/divergence) histograms support the recent bullish defense, in my opinion.

Bitcoin has held key cloud-based support at $40,000, and the daily stochastics have formed an oversold 'buy' signal following a three-day gain, indicating a short-term bullish bias.

For those unfamiliar, stochastics are technical analysis indicators that swing between 0 and 100, allowing traders to spot oversold and overbought circumstances as well as trade entry and exit positions. When stochastics fall below 20, an asset is deemed oversold, and when they rise beyond 80, it is called overbought. A move upward from below 20 is considered a buy signal.

The 200-day SMA of $48,000 has come into view as a result of the three-day rally. The average proved difficult to overcome in late March, delaying the rebound rally from lows near $37,500. On the downside, the sellers must break through Monday's low of $38,550. According to CoinDesk statistics, Bitcoin was recently trading near $42,300, signifying a 2% rise for the day.

I am not sure how things will unfold, but my decision, for now, is to trade assets to BTC from USDT and BEAN (beanstalk), which I honestly think is going to recover from an unfortunate event, cause I still believe in their concept. What's your decision so far?",11,2022-04-21 19:20:16,5
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Can blockchain solve data privacy concerns?,"Rapid improvements in digital technology over the last several decades have also raised new data privacy and security issues. As a result, hacking, identity theft, and other breaches of digital privacy are becoming more common.  


But can blockchain really solve data privacy concerns? I started getting more interested in this subject as I heard of Zenotta's blockchain which turns digital files into a digital asset. It's good to know that there are these types of solutions anyway, but I would like to hear from someone who used a blockchain as solving issues with data privacy and protection.  


Blockchain is currently widely regarded as one of the most reliable data security methods on the market. Rapid improvements in digital technology have given rise to new data security concerns. Organizations must have strong authentication and cryptographic key vaulting protocols in place to protect their data.  


What would you list as the biggest advantage of storing data on the blockchain?",11,2022-04-21 15:32:04,5

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Solana Increased by 13.33%, Will it Keep Increasing?","
Over the last day, Solana (SOL) was able to keep up well above the $30.69 support level and showed a reversal sign to come back. As shown in CoinMarketCap, Solana hovers at $37.19, with a 2.41% rise in the past 24 hours with a trading volume of $1,177,991,580.15, dropping by 27.14%.

News from CoinQuora indicated that looking at the daily chart of SOL/USDT, SOL is forming a rising flag pattern in the bearish market starting from May 12, 2022. The support zone of SOL lies around $20 – $30. SOL turned out to be in a side-way market for 24 days ever since it dropped to the support zone, and eventually, it started gradually making a reversal like other blockchain tokens like Concordium(CCD), Tezos(XTZ) and Fantom(FTM).

According to CoinMarketCap, SOL has 1.39% of the current market and has the rank of 9. Within a week, SOL swings from $31.06  to $37.48. The support level of $20 – $30 can make or break the situation for SOL bulls. Is any of the SOL buyers here involved in putting a buying block at $33.77? Well I hope it bounces back from the support zone.",1,2022-07-15 06:47:27,3

Is it always necessary to be ""clever,"" as in ""carefully weighing all the facts,"" or do you occasionally listen to the inner voice that tells you what to do?  


As I noticed with the present level of volatility in the cryptocurrency market, understanding the many techniques for investing in this market has never been more important. There are traders on one side and investors on the other. Many individuals wrongly feel that their objectives are the same, although they are not. Traders will retain assets until they attain short-term success, whereas investors would use the buy-and-hold method. Investors put their money in for years, decades, or even centuries.  


I got very interested in Unicoin which was presented by Unicorn Hunters and it looks trustworthy, I have that good, positive feeling about it. That's why I would like to hear from you guys, how do you decide what to invest in.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,EverImpact (BSC) | DeFi Token | 75% Burn after Presale | Double BUSD Reflections | KYC & Audit," 

EverImpact

The EverImpact token is the core of the EverImpact ecosystem. Designed as a utility reward token, as well as a long-term reserve asset, it supports all the project's utilities and will be used as a means to collect rewards and transact on the ecosystem in the future.

Holders of EverImpact will receive rewards in INCOME tokens and BUSD.

On the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), EverImpact is the next evolution of the reflection token: the first INCOME and Binance Pegged USD ($BUSD) reflection token to optimize user profits both now and in the future across multiple on-chain protocols. Simply hold $EIT tokens to automatically receive a proportional share of transactions in $BUSD and $INCOME, cascading to the $BUSD rewards from $INCOME token holdings.

This is automatically transferred to your wallet every 60 minutes. EverImpact has a total supply of 1,000,000,000,000,000 EIT.

Following launch, there will be a staged burn of 75% of the $EIT total supply, which will be permanently removed from the total supply and further $EIT will be burned continuously via the HyperBurn mechanism.

An Anti-Whale system discourages significant sells by limiting sell transactions to a maximum of 0.1% of the circulating supply.

With every transaction, a small percentage of tokens are automatically transferred to the PancakeSwap Liquidity Pool.

EverImpact also secures a portion of every transaction as part of the HyperBurn protocol – whereby these tokens are then sent to a certified Burn address – removing them permanently from circulation. This last step means holders of $EIT continuously receive a higher share of the overall rewards distributed and the circulating supply will continually diminish over time.

Buys

2% is redistributed to all holders in $BUSD & INCOME  
Secondary Reflection of 20% Rewards in $BUSD for INCOME Token holders.  
1% is used for the Hyper-Burn mechanism.  
1% is sent to the marketing wallet to fund marketing, utility development and community management.  
1% is sent to the IMPACT wallet.  
1% is transferred into the Liquidity Pool on PancakeSwap to create a stable price floor.

Sells

6% is redistributed to all holders in $BUSD & INCOME  
Secondary Reflection of 20% Rewards in $BUSD for INCOME Token holders.  
3% is used for the Hyper-Burn mechanism.  
3% is sent to the marketing wallet to fund marketing, utility development and community

3% is sent to the IMPACT wallet.  
3% is transferred into the Liquidity Pool on PancakeSwap to create a stable price floor.

EverImpact will be using capital raised in the IMPACT wallet to invest in philanthropic based organizations focused on the care and guidance of those impacted by world events, specifically the mental health implications.

The focus will be on the philanthropy aspects of the project to invest in Charitable works and invest in organizations and professionals alike, Psychologists and Counsellors, to provide real assistance to those struggling with the pressures of modern society and current world affairs, such as those in the Ukraine.

Contract Audit will be completed as part of the presale process.

EverImpact will complete KYC of the founding team through PinkSale.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"The two most valuable assets were always gold and oil, but now we have a third - bitcoin","History showed us the two most valuable assets gold and bitcoin, but now we have added one - Bitcoin. I was surprised when I find out how investing in these three assets can reduce risks and potential loss. I'm wondering what all that looks like, do you have any idea about it?   


Bitcoin is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency with some similarities to gold. Indeed, many have referred to bitcoin as ""digital gold"" in the past because of its poor correlation with all other assets, particularly equities. Bitcoin, like gold, has a finite supply. In terms of rarity, both are rare, as far as liquidity is concerned, both are good.   


Have you heard maybe about this investing strategy, to invest in gold, bitcoin, and gold? Duet Protocol recently listed gold and oil. Users may obtain gold, oil, and bitcoin (BTC already available on the site), allowing them to establish a portfolio that includes both traditional and crypto assets using a single crypto wallet.  


I've heard these days that more and more people started to invest in three assets because it's more secure and it minimizes any risk. When it comes to these sorts of economic crises, it's always a good idea to pay greater attention to gold. During periods of stagflation, fears about economic growth and inflation drive up safe-haven demand, driving up the price of gold.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,When are ETH fees going to drop to minimum?,"From what I have seen, while fees on the Ethereum network have dropped considerably in recent months, reaching a low of $5.98 per transaction in mid-March, gas expenses on the second-largest cryptocurrency network by market capitalization are on the rise once more. On Sunday, April 3rd, the average transaction network charge was 0.0056 ether ($19.58 per transfer).

This means that there will be more transactions on the network while we wait for the ETH network to move to proof of stake. I'm not sure when they'll release it, but I believe transaction charges will climb as more bullish patterns appear in the market.

I'm not happy with how they're handling the ETH 2.0 changeover. I still utilize low-transaction-cost stablecoins like USDT, BEAN (To be honest I still have faith in them, unfortunately, they are currently in a tough situation, but I hope it's was just bad luck), or BUSD to transfer my money, but it would be a lot easier if I could do it directly on the ETH network.

I've found an excellent statement online ""The harsh reality is that much of the data that is collected is not collected with your full conscious consent. Regulations like the GDPR can only go so far since companies can find their way around certain rules. There is an incentive for them to do so, usually at the expense of the data subject (you). And let’s be honest, we all know that if you’re getting something for free, you’re actually the product. "" This is so true!  


I remember earlier that I did everything I could to protect my data, from using strong passwords to using anti-virus and anti-malware software, etc. But now when tech developed this far this all seems ridiculous, now we have Zenotta and all this stuff that works through blockchain to protect our data which is so much better and safer.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Jimizz - Grab the bull by the balls ! - [JMZ]," 

**What is Jimizz?**

**Jimizz**  is a cryptocurrency on the Binance Smart Chain designed by France's  leading adult entertainment provider, Jacquie&Michel, to  revolutionise the sector with new features that will benefit consumers,  creators, and investors.

For too  long, middlemen have stood between content producers and consumers,  siphoning off the work of creators to extract advertising revenue,  charging exorbitant banking fees, pushing independent producers into  ever more precarious financial positions, and censoring them in order to  appease the conservative lobbies that advocate the abolition of  pornography. For 150 years, from the invention of photography to virtual  reality, the porn industry has been quick to embrace new technologies  in order to offer an ever-improving experience to its consumers.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Exchange Market Insights Report for April 2022,"BTC approached $48,000 in late March, a major barrier level that had not been broken since September of last year. The flagship cryptocurrency reversed to the $40-42,000 level after failing to go through. 

This was serving as new support, and was significantly more than the previous support of $36-38,000 in the first quarter of 2022. BTC, on the other hand, had fallen below the $40,000 mark at the time of writing. 

Over the last 30 days, layer-one protocols have outperformed, with NEAR being the best-performing large-cap currency. It was up 64% at the time of writing, thanks to a $350 million capital raising led by Tiger Global. 

SOL and ADA were also strong performers in the large-cap category, rising 37.5 percent and 31.16 percent, respectively over the last 30 days.

Despite a solid 30-day performance, the start of April has been lackluster, with losses across the board in the biggest sectors. Gaming suffered the worst setback, with a -13.3 percent drop, followed by Web3 and Defi with a -10 percent and a -9 percent drop, respectively. Even cryptos like $Cray and Doge have been hit in their own way. Cryptos are currently in a state of decline and we only hope they start rising in value in the nearest future.",11,2022-04-18 18:48:52,3

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Trading or Staking | What to choose for a beginner,"As the popularity and legitimacy of cryptocurrencies grow, more and more people perceive them as a way of earning money. There are several methods of raising capital. Some require knowledge and effort from the user and some only time. This article will look at two popular earning methods, analyze their pros and cons, and help you choose the one that suits you.

### Are You Active or Passive?

Even before you buy a cryptocurrency, you need to decide how you want to increase your portfolio. That is, to go into profit. There are several ways:

* to invest to trade (sell/buy and earn on price fluctuations);
* invest in top coins and hold them until the profit on its sale seems satisfactory;
* invest in coins to earn interest: staking or lending.

It is crucial to decide on a strategy before the first purchase of cryptocurrency: because it will depend, banal, on how much time per week you will devote to tracking the exchange rate. And if you are determined not to lose money, then you understand the importance of such awareness.  


### Choose the Asset Wisely

Evaluate the crypto assets you want to buy. First, you must give the cryptocurrency you want to buy your definition. And obviously, the first thing you need to understand is whether it is a reliable asset. To do this, answer several very simple questions:

* How long has this cryptocurrency been on the market?
* Have there been bright ups and downs during this time? When and against what background did this happen? Media monitoring is needed here. This is important if you don’t want to “point your finger at the sky.” Thus, you will now understand whether something significant influences a particular crypto asset. So that, if you still choose an asset, you can understand for the future what it can “storm” from and what news to track.
* Does any influencer directly affect this asset? For example, Elon Musk, the Winklevoss brothers, Michael J. Saylor, and so on.
* Was the cryptocurrency’s price able to recover or reach new all-time highs after the fall?
* Does the asset have liquidity on the exchange where you trade?
* What are the trading volumes on the coin — the higher, the better. Low trading volumes mean that the asset is not available on many platforms, or traders are not interested in it. 

### Crypto Trading

Trading on the crypto exchange requires knowledge and skills that come from many months of practice. Getting to know trading should start with an overview of the main tools. When opening a trading terminal on any crypto exchange, you will see approximately the same set of tools: a price chart for the selected trading pair, an order book, information on trading volumes, and transaction history. You need to read charts, analyze them, have fundamental and technical analysis skills, analyze crypto market sentiment, and track the news background.

Many exchanges provide a demo account where you can practice and try out new strategies. The principle of operation is similar to real trading, so it is strongly recommended that every beginner first test their strength in this way. This will allow you to understand the terminology and essential tools.

In addition to the usual trading, the essence of which boils down to “buy cheaper and sell more expensive”, other varieties are especially popular during periods of a bearish trend and allow you to make money even during falling markets. For example, futures trading is a kind of betting on whether the rate will go up or down after a particular time. Or margin trading — this opportunity is now provided by almost all well-known crypto exchanges. In this case, the platform provides users with leverage in an amount several times higher than the amount the trader possesses. In this way, you can significantly increase your profit, but keep in mind that the risks are also growing.

### Trading Strategies

If you intend to trade, you need to understand how active: weekly, daily, or every minute. It is mandatory to be able to read an order book. It would also be nice to understand indicators and chart patterns. Analyze whether whales operate and whether market making takes place. Also, analyze market sentiment, that is, who dominates bulls or bears.

Among other things, knowledge of technical and fundamental analysis is required from the trader:

* Technical analysis. A forecasting method based on the study of past asset quotes. It is believed that the dynamics of the cryptocurrency exchange rate are cyclical. The growth and fall in demand for BTC and altcoins occur according to the same patterns. To identify these recurring situations, users look for patterns on the chart of a trading pair, determine the support and resistance levels, and try to predict reversal points using Elliott waves or Fibonacci levels.
* Fundamental analysis. It is based on studying economic, political, and news prerequisites for changing quotes. To trade using this method, users follow the news, and speeches of major investors and politicians, evaluate the prospects of cryptocurrencies, compare their technical characteristics, and analyze the economic situation and sentiment in other markets (stock, commodity, currency).

Trading can be both short-term, medium-term, and long-term. Day traders or scalpers who open a lot of orders within one trading day are more focused on technical analysis. Due to the short time intervals, transactions of day traders and scalpers usually bring a small profit, less than 1%. Medium-term and long-term traders typically focus on fundamental analysis. Technical analysis is used only as an addition that eliminates unnecessary noise in price fluctuations and helps find the optimal market entry points. Trades are carried out less frequently than with scalping. The order can remain open for up to several weeks. At the same time, the user can expect a high income from each trade.  


### How Much Can You Earn?

You can both earn a lot and lose all your funds. Trading requires experience and involves high risks. Trading is much riskier than staking: a trader makes a lot of trades, which is why he incurs more costs for fees. And if the cumulative losses exceed the total profit, the deposit will be reset very quickly.  


### Trading: Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* High potential profit. Cryptocurrencies are very volatile, sometimes allowing traders to earn significant amounts in just one day.
* Low entry threshold. It is enough to make the first trade on the market to have only $10. This is the average size of the minimum order on the crypto exchange. However, it is better to start trading at least $100 so that there is always a reserve of free money in case you need to average a position or buy another crypto asset.
* There is no payback time. You don’t need to buy expensive equipment, as in the case of mining, count interest on loans, or lock your assets for specific time periods.
* Thanks to futures and margin trading, there is an opportunity to earn both on the growth and the fall of cryptocurrencies.

**Cons**

* High risks. Where there is a large profit, there are high risks. Moreover, the risks are always directly proportional to the potential profitability. When trading with leverage, the risks only grow.
* Constant training and discipline. Trading is a full-fledged, extremely resource-intensive work. Traders need to learn and analyze their mistakes constantly.  


### Crypto Staking

Cryptocurrency staking is the voluntary locking of one’s assets for the purpose of passive income. Staking is available in blockchains using Proof of Stake and its varieties, for example, Delegated PoS (Tron, Cosmos, etc.) or Liquid PoS (Tezos). Classic solo staking has a high entry threshold. For example, to become a solo staker on the Ethereum network, you will need at least 32 ETH (about $60,000) and a computer connected to the internet \~24/7. However, users can deposit a smaller amount into the staking pools, thus delegating coins to validators. This way, they do not need to run their own node, but the profit will be less. The disadvantage of the staking pool: if this pool does not sign the block, the user may not receive a reward.  


### Staking Types

The main principle of staking is universal for all its types — a certain amount of cryptocurrency is on the user’s account, for which he receives passive income. The amount of capital determines the level of profit. Also, the operation mechanism can be supplemented by other conditions that depend on the type of staking. For example, some systems provide payments only to validators. Then, stakeholders sometimes combine assets, creating pools and becoming validators, and draw up a common contract. The profit is divided among the pool participants in multiples of the contribution size.

* **Locked Staking**

With this type of staking, the user locks his assets for a specific period. The duration of this period cannot be changed. The main advantage of this type is the high-interest rate. Usually, the APR that the staker will receive at the end of the specified period is indicated in advance, but the reward may vary. Locked staking is characterized by high profitability compared to other types of staking.

* **Flexible Staking**

In this case, the contract does not provide a specific period of holding coins. The user, at will, can terminate it at any time and withdraw the cryptocurrency. The interest is accrued until the staker transfers the funds to another wallet or places an order in exchange for the sale of tokens. Earnings, in this case, are insignificant (from 1% to a maximum of 20% per year). Flexible staking is suitable for users who are not ready for long-term agreements on the retention of cryptocurrencies and want permanent access to their capital.

* **Cold Staking**

The most secure option. The locking of cryptocurrencies occurs on a hardware wallet that does not have a permanent Internet connection. This option is not available for all coins and trading platforms. In addition, the coins must always be located at the same address. In case of relocation, the contract is terminated, and the reward is not paid.

Cold staking is relevant for owners of large volumes of coins that do not want to risk their loss in the event of a crypto exchange being hacked.

* **Liquid Staking**

Liquid staking allows token holders to stake their tokens, forcing them to work in DeFi. This is the best of both worlds: Staking and DeFi, with no cryptocurrency lock-up periods, which can sometimes take up to 28 days. Liquid staking solves the incompatibility crisis between DeFi chains by allowing the use of derivative assets in DeFi protocols to generate income and staking rewards, helping to unlock liquidity locked in PoS networks. One of the most popular liquid staking platforms is the Lido. The protocol allows you to stake ETH, SOL, MATIC, DOT, and KSM. After adding tokens to the staking pool, the user receives a similar number of derivative tokens (for example, if you deposit 1000 ETH, you will receive 1000 stETH). Further, stETH can be used as a regular ETH, for example, to generate income in other DeFi protocols. The crucial point is that the staker receives a staking reward and additional income for using stTokens in DeFi protocols.

* **DeFi Staking**

DeFi staking is not exactly staking in its traditional sense. With the help of DeFi staking, users can stake not only PoS blockchain tokens but also PoW, such as BTC, LTC, USDT, USDC, and others. In the DeFi staking, there are counterparties — platforms that take your coins at interest. At the same time, the security of the transaction is provided by a smart contract and completely depends on the presence or absence of vulnerabilities in it. Many platforms offer DeFi staking services. For example, the well-known crypto exchange Binance allows you to stake 15 assets, including BTC, ETH, USDT, DAI, and other major coins. The exchange acts as a showcase and cooperates with several leading DeFi protocols, such as Venus, Aave, dYdX, and others. Users can deposit tokens for a floating or locked period, after which the Binance redirects the deposited amount to one of the DeFi protocols to generate profit.   


### How Much Can You Earn?

It is impossible to give an exact number: the interest may vary depending on the selected token. Also, note that if you stake tokens using third-party platforms, the profitability varies from platform to platform. It should also be understood that you can not just earn a little but even lose a lot in some cases.

* For example, you bought $1000 worth of the coin and staked it at 100% APR. However, this does not mean that in a year, you will get $2000. The profit will depend on the exchange rate of the coin. If it remains at the same level, your profit will double. If the exchange rate has increased, the earnings will be even more. But if the coin has dropped significantly in price, then, in the end, you may be left with only $100-200, depending on the depth of the fall.

Risks are present, as in any other type of investment. But even here, they can be minimized. Stablecoins will help in this. The most famous are USDT, BUSD, and USDC. There are platforms within which you can earn up to 10-20% APR for the staking stablecoins.

### Staking: Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* Minimal risks of losing funds, especially when it comes to stablecoin staking.
* Passive income. The user earns simply for depositing their tokens into the staking pool. Moreover, the yield is higher than that of any bank deposit.
* Large stakeholders receive voting power and can participate in the project's further development.
* You do not need to have special knowledge and skills.
* Stocking types: locked, flexible, liquid, and DeFi staking.

**Cons**

* Loss in the price of a digital asset. The more the exchange rate of the coin decreases, the smaller the amount of interest specified in the contract will be. This is especially acute when concluding a contract for a locked term. Noticing a sharp price decrease, the user will be unable to sell the asset.
* Relatively low profitability by the standards of the crypto market.

### Closing Thoughts

In this article, we have considered two ways of earning — trading and staking. Trading is an active way of earning money. In other words, a full-fledged job requires the user to have deep technical knowledge, constant involvement, risk management skills, market sentiment analysis, news background, and much more. Trading involves great risks, but this method can bring the biggest profit. On the other hand, staking is a passive type of earnings that does not require much knowledge, time, and effort. At the same time, staking is not so risky and is more regarded as a way to get little extra earnings.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Will Bitcoin go below 20,000 $ again? Here's the Price Prediction.","Before predicting future prices for Bitcoin (BTC), it's important that we understand some recent crypto developments.

Bitcoin Price and Ethereum (ETH) have climbed their way back to approximately $24,000 and $1900, respectively, in mid-August ‘22. This was after both tokens experienced a steep decline for the last few months. Other stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), seem to have maintained a steady trajectory. This isn't a surprise considering both are pegged to the US dollar.

Solana (SOL) is also experiencing a gradual climb in valuation. On the other hand, Ripple (XRP) has dropped by a few decimal points in that same period.

Now, it is impossible to give a definitive answer for future price predictions. However, according to [Bitcoin Price Prediction](https://blog.coindcx.com/price-predictions/bitcoin-price-weekly/), it is primed to hit $30,000 in the near future

Now, the initial crash happened primarily due to two reasons:

* The US Federal Government decided to hike interest rates by 0.75%. The subsequent panic hit when mainstream news covered that decision. People jumped to conclusions immediately. 
* The Terra network decided it would be a good idea to sell their entire BTC reserve to make up for the drop in UST valuation. That drove BTC valuation into the ground and created a ripple effect across the entire crypto space. The Terra-Luna crash could be considered the catalyst for the broader market meltdown, even more so than the interest rate hike. 

However, the crash has sustained itself for so long because users continued to sell out of panic, driving valuations further down. 

BTC's current price is a testament to how moderation in investor behavior can lift token value. So, the token’s potential to drop below $18,000 is mainly dependent on if users go back to selling on a large scale.

All of this can be explained by three questions:

* **What was the most common reaction when the initial panic hit?**

Investors and users decided to get rid of their portfolios, selling tokens impulsively.

* **What did that result in?**

It drove the value further down.

* **When will prices stabilize?** 

Prices will only stabilize once people stop engaging with the market out of fear.

As experts cannot anticipate investor behavior, they cannot give a definitive answer for price directions. Of course, market trends can be analyzed, and global financial situations can be used as a baseline for predictions. However, those estimates don't mean anything when people themselves are selling tokens erratically.

Users must moderate their behavior to stabilize the crypto market. The hope is that investors settle down a little and shift towards a long-term investment approach. If that happens, BTC prices will not drop any lower.",1,2022-08-14 05:25:53,0

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,BOBZcoin Manifesto: the Future of ‘Sick’ Entertainment,"In the early days of the 2020 pandemic a small bar in Long Island took a leap of faith into macabre, sinister entertainment. This leap was a rudimentary betting pool on whether Chicago or NYC would experience greater gun violence over the Labor Day weekend. It garnered local media attention, and a fair amount of outrage, the authorities attempted to shut it down, but failed. Bobzcoin wishes to expand on that story, allowing its users to place bets not only on gun violence, but violence of all causes, overdose deaths, terrorist attacks, when and where the next school massacre will occur, vehicle related deaths and Wars etc….

Coin Functionality

Betting on Bodies will have a peer-to-peer betting system, one where any two parties can take bets on gun violence, or other categories that are outside the mainstream and would be considered morally precarious. Users will have the ability to bet against one another utilizing a secure p2p protocol., e.g. All funds associated with a bet will be placed in a secure wallet controlled by the administrators, this will allow us to expediently distribute funds to the winners and ensure that parties do not back out of a wager. The administrators will charge a small holding fee, no more than 10% of each wager.

Tokenomics

When a user purchases a BOBzcoin via pancakeswap, they will receive 85% of the value purchased. 15% of their purchase will be allocated as follows: 10% is sent to a secure wallet held by the BOBzCoin team, this will be used exclusively for Development, Marketing and Management. 3% of every purchase will be allocated to our holders. The amount each holder receives will be based on the amount of BOBzcoin they currently hold, the more a holder possesses the greater the amount received. This 3% is often referred to as a ‘user tax’. 2% will be burned in a secure wallet. When coins are burned at a controlled and steady pace, this gradually increases the value of a coin. 

Ethos

While the self-righteous, pretentious crowd of clowns may attempt to cancel or drown us out, they fail to grasp the true nature of humanity. We enjoy watching others suffer, we relish violence, we embrace chaos. Most of us are constrained by the shackles of mundane lives, insipid relationships and a life trajectory that offers little in the realm of invigorating excitement, Bobzcoin will capitalize on our darkest impulses. Bobzcoin will not judge those who want to see others fall victim to gun violence, we will not cancel those who express violent desires, we will never view something as too violent to indulge. 

As we all engage in the perpetual rat race imposed on us by modern western society, we fall further into the abyss of a cultureless environment, dominated by concentrated wealth held by a small number of corporate conglomerates, buttressed by a corrupt government. These institutions are not there to help us or protect us, they exist only to further enrich a decadent and hedonistic ruling class. As power and autonomy has slipped from the grasp of the everyday normie and eccentric autist, the BOBZcoin community wishes to expose the absurdity and cruelty of modern society.

Cancelling cancel culture is one prominent object we seek to achieve. By normalizing and embracing the worst aspects of humanity we will render the superficial and manufactured virtue of the ruling elite null and void. How can one stomach the twisted ideology of modern society, individuals have had their livelihoods destroyed, families broken apart and thrust into the oblivion and indignation of cancellation by expressing views that do not adhere to a narrow and perverse mainstream narrative. Canceling someone is a death sentence. You are not abruptly or with immediate effect ending their existence, but you strip them of their financial support, ability to communicate (as the majority of information mediums are controlled by major conglomerates), and lastly, they are robbed of their dignity. Deaths from despair have grown exponentially over the past decade, this is not a coincidence, this is a direct ramification of the exploitation that the ruling class enforces and then demands we emulate on a micro level, via the perpetual rat race.

Why BOBZcoin will work

The world is quickly descending into rapid, irreparable disrepair. Wars are ubiquitous, the environment is inhospitable, supply chains are strained exacerbated by growing geopolitical tensions, and societies are being torn apart by socio economic and demographic changes. All this chaos will lead to one constant, Violence! Death, Destruction and Chaos will only go up, like a stock promoted by the apes on Wall Street Bets, there will be nothing to stop the indomitable rise of BobzCoin. 

Per all the reasons listed above, people are irate, pent-up frustration is ready to explode. The elites want us to remain silent, to suffer and accept their positions of power as warranted, as opposed to stolen. We know that is Bullshit! As this perverse society tears itself apart, let's set aside the virtue signaling and embrace violence. People want this, people want to become Bobbers, they want to watch this sick society burn down! Therefore BOBZcoin will work. Let’s shoot to the moon, while the clowns and sycophants shoot each other.",1,2022-04-20 07:33:29,3
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Rookie asking for advice,"
Hi everyone 

I’m new to buying cryptocurrency.
I bought about 1000 USD of Bitcoin and 250 USD of Ethereum.

I received my wage from my student job today & want to invest part of it in crypto. 

I know it is best to do my own research, which I’m doing btw… 

But I thought that’s asking more experienced traders for their opinion might be helpful. 

1. Is it a good time to invest? Values are low, but then there is the regression of the economy.

2. Which cryptocurrency should I buy? 

Stick with BTC & ETH or also buy SOL & ADA? 

My budget is 1200 USD now

I appreciate any tips or help!",1,2022-08-02 16:12:51,0

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Memecoins have generated more money than all my altcoins combined,"I don’t know if this is some weird flex or what lmaooo, but my meme coins have genuinely generated more profits than my altcoins. I have a somewhat diverse portfolio, and I do not plan on giving up on any of the coins I currently hold just because memecoins are doing better, but I do plan on putting more money into memecoins. 

$ELON alone has made me more money than SOL, ADA, and AVAX combined. I think that was because it pumped a whopping 120% in one day, but still, my point stands. 

Hopefully, I see more pumps like that happening again, especially because I've invested more into it. Anyways, what are your thoughts?",1,2022-02-19 15:31:43,3
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Meme coins generated my friend more profits than his altcoins,"I was discussing with one of friends about what generated him the most return in 2021, and i was shocked to know that meme coins did the necessary job. 

He informed me that one meme coin ($ELON) generated him more profits than SOL, ADA, and AVAX combined, especially when it pumped by 120% in one day. 

So i did the logical thing and bought a Dogelon bag to see what will the outcome be this year, hopefully it goes as planned.",1,2022-01-08 22:45:29,4

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Ascend | $ASND | First Ever Rebase Token with SOLANA rewards!🔥 | Presale on 26/10," 

Ascend is the first rebase token with Solana rewards🤯

Hold $ASND and receive Solana airdrops🚀

Rebase is a decrease or increase in the supply of the token being traded in both the liquidity pools, and across holder wallets. Rebase tokenomics are performed by the team in order to change up the price of the token, without affecting the value of the holders tokens at the time it is performed. The rebase tokenomics allow the chart to look healthy even if the chart does begin to dip. Another benefit of of these tokenomics, is that we will appear on trading platforms as high gainers, as a result of the chart creating an illusion of a significant rise in price which gives us free organic promotion, allowing us to spend funds on other things that will benefit the project and the community

Join the Telegram channel for further announcements.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Foxvilleapp is direct competitor of AxieInfinity - 2D NFTs Whitelist on 25th,"Foxville is inspired by the most famous game of decentralized gaming technology, that is, Axieinfinity. Most of us have played or invest in Axieinfinity at one point while using etherum blockchain on desktop or other devices. This game has a total user base of 89.7k and recorded over $1.6 billion in total sales . A vague estimate suggests that there are approximately 300 million users of crypto worldwide. If only 5% of this population opt for Foxville farm that make 15 million users for the game in initial stages.  


In Foxville users can play against the environment and also against other players. Players can enter multiple universes within the game and can also trade their in-game assets with other players on Solana blockchain or other blockchains due to cross chain interoperability features. Additionally, if the player logs out of the game, his information is permanently stored on the blockchain, the user can also hold their in-game asset in form of NFTs or they can utilize their non-NFT in-game assets in other games as well, that is an intrinsic feature of blockchain gaming.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Unique Features of Cyclos AMM!,"Cyclos is a concentrated liquidity market maker. That means AMM protocol lets liquidity providers choose what price ranges their liquidity will be active and earning rewards. This is different from other AMM solutions for a couple of reasons: 

First, concentrated liquidity refers to LP assets that are only actively traded between a price range selected by the owner of those assets. The result of this way of distributing liquidity is that volume for trades is deepened around the more frequently traded price points, allowing for much larger trades to be executed with lower slippage. The concept also allows for some very cool innovations which have not yet been explored by other platforms, but that we are actively pursuing, as explained below: 

Second, the lowering of capital requirements for bootstrapping new pools- this is especially relevant for launching new project tokens on Solana. At the moment, if a project wants to bootstrap trading liquidity, it is extremely costly as liquidity is not actively managed. By lowering the capital requirements, we will allow more native-SPL tokens to flourish and bring more projects/users over to the chain. There are no capital-efficient models for executing this at the moment and we will be the first to introduce this. 

Third, if we look at the state of liquidity on platforms like Raydium, it is highly underutilized. On 3 of the top volume trading pairs (USDC-SOL, BTC-USDC, RAY-SOL), LP fees are extremely low and uncompetitive (3.5%, 1.5%, 0.4% APY respectively. We are able to drastically improve the returns for LPs compared to the current situation on Raydium and other competitor platforms.  

And lastly, Cyclos introduces the ability to carry out stable asset market making on order books. Our algorithm-based competitors cannot make those markets efficiently because of the way they distribute liquidity. For newer protocols targeting that market, such as Saber or Mercurial, they don't utilize order books and aim to build liquidity from scratch.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Typing my frustration.,"Sent 10 Sol to the wrong addresses. They had the exact same address as my wallet address but instead of an ""F"" they had and ""f"" on one on the other i missed typing an ""r"" and that still landed. Goodbye hard work hope whoever got it is happy with the soon to be $2,000 in sol.. I fucking hate my life. Genuinely.  Nice to know I cant win the lottery or type in a random number for a credit card but I can nail a 20 digit long id of numbers and letters both lowercase and capital.... why is my life perpetually getting fucked... must be nice to live in the parallel world...FUCK ME. Wonder when ill finally break and actually decide to to quit. I hate the game of life, all there is is perpetual suffering, exhaustion, loneliness, poverty, and struggle. I feel like im in a race where all I'm doing is running as hard as I can while watching others in cars go by.  All the meanwhile hating myself because of how dumb I am. I make way to many mistakes trying to be more and I hate my life settling into a monotonous lonely life. Anyways I'm tired of it all.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Foxvilleapp is direct competitor of AxieInfinity - 2D NFTs Whitelist on 25th,"Foxville is inspired by the most famous game of decentralized gaming technology, that is, Axieinfinity. Most of us have played or invest in Axieinfinity at one point while using etherum blockchain on desktop or other devices. This game has a total user base of 89.7k and recorded over $1.6 billion in total sales . A vague estimate suggests that there are approximately 300 million users of crypto worldwide. If only 5% of this population opt for Foxville farm that make 15 million users for the game in initial stages.  


In Foxville users can play against the environment and also against other players. Players can enter multiple universes within the game and can also trade their in-game assets with other players on Solana blockchain or other blockchains due to cross chain interoperability features. Additionally, if the player logs out of the game, his information is permanently stored on the blockchain, the user can also hold their in-game asset in form of NFTs or they can utilize their non-NFT in-game assets in other games as well, that is an intrinsic feature of blockchain gaming.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Lets talk about the best coins when it comes to HODL,"I will be putting a lot of my concentration on ANKR stable coin. My ethos will be HODL as always… i would appreciate other views on this coin, as i believe its going to the stars !

I have a list of coins which will be staying in my wallet/s for at least 3years

$ETH
$ADA
$SOL
$ANKR
$BEPRO
$LUNA
$SHIB
$ONE
$DOT
$XRP
$CKB
$VRA
$PLOT
$ZIG

I do not exceed the list of coins above - I believe its important to spread your eggs out; but try and concentrate on rising the stakes, within each basket - paying close attention to the dips. A lion knows when to pounce!

That way; returns are higher and at the same time you have a good amount of coins covered - which is upping your chances of hitting big !

What are everyones thoughts

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Foxville.app is leading blockchain gaming platform - 2D NFTs Whitelist in 9 hr 0.5SOL,"Foxville derives its competitive edge from updated features that its offer, which includes NFT staking, multiverses, cross-chain interoperability, DAO and many other features. Foxville is user friendly and forward looking platform that aims at evolving as a community.  


**Fair Comparison…**

Foxville is a decentralized play to earn gaming platform that has integrated DeFi and gaming. It is a GameFi. It has an exciting farm based game unlike the usual old centralized free to play Farmville. Foxville has 11 different categories and 176 versatile traits. A quick comparison between the two can make it clear.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|**Foxville**|**Farmville**|
|:-|:-|
|Play to earn|Free to play|
|Decentralized|Centralized|
|Multiverses|One universe|
|Better visuals, AR, VR|Augmented reality|

This was a quick comparison between our childhood favorite, Farmville and blockchain integrated GameFi, Foxville. However, there are other farm based games on blockchain too.

&#x200B;

|**Foxville**|**FarmTown**|**CryptoBytes**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Play to earn|Free to play|Fun to play|
|Decentralized|Centralized|Decentralized|
|PVE and PVP|PVE|PVE|
|Native token|World currencies|Native token|
|AR, VR|AR|AR|
|Multiverses|One screen|No multiverses|
|Cross-chain interoperability|No cross chain interoperability|No cross chain interoperability|
|Solana Blockchain|\-----|Binance smart chain|

The game of Foxville depends majorly on Fox-Farmers. These Fox-Farmers will be able to harvest crops, and perform other farm duties to create a lavishing farm. These farmers can then sell their assets in the Foxville marketplace to generate wealth to upgrade their living standard and their farm.

Besides carefully catering to the needs of its investor, this platform offers an entertaining game for its audience. The game revolves around the Fox village community. It’s residents can create a small farm on a fertile piece of land and start earning tokens through performing small farm duties. As the players advance in the game, exciting features unlock. The game also offers different playing modes, where players can play against the environment or against other players as well. Moreover, the platform offers in-game item crafting and tournaments to keep its players entertained.

**How do I get them…**

In Addition to these, this platform offers 2D and 3D NFTs for its user to provide better visuals. To add further, this project has multiverses in its game with an added option of virtual reality and augmented reality. Players can travel across these parallel universes to unlock more exciting features.  The Foxman NFTs are designed based on 10 categories and 126 characteristics. These characteristics are further listed on the rarity spectrum which majorly determines the value of NFTs.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"The rebrand has begun and the relaunch comes closer every day. Frictionless is here. Don't miss the presale, that will affect everything. 90 minutes AMA.","
The team of Frictionless (Former SoFi, BSC) set the sails to unexplored waters, an innovation that has never been tried in crypto.

The first OTC (Over the counter/On the chain) token/coin trading place for smart contract chains. 
Starting with BSC this service will get expanded to Polygon, SOL, DOT, Neo, ADA and other chains once successfully implemented into the eco system of the BSC. It will stay chain focused, an chain agnostic version is in the final steps of the road map.

This means, that there is no price impact through the trades. The benefits are endless. Unique problems require unique solutions. 

Check out this big ass AMA.

https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1062270953

The longer you watch this video the more soaked in you get by the road map and the problems that it will solve for crypto.

- No more team/marketing/development/donation wallet dumps by project that need to get funds for development or marketing. 

- Whales will take the safer route of using the Auction wall for wallet to wallet switches with other users. 

- Less new investors get burned and thus are able to learn more about crypto without getting disheartened.

- New innovative way to acquire token that are not yet listed.

- No gas fee! (Check the AMA please, I implore you!)

But that is not all of course, they are a doxxed team with good record and they are the founders of the token alliance, a group of projects that work together to create a safer environment in crypto:

Shared interest, shared resources, shared investors.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"10X - 20X Gem Red Pill -SOL100, a Solana Token — Easy, Fast & Practical 10x — Make it before Christmas - Still under $2,000 per token","Are you into collecting NFT’s? then SOL100 is right up your ally. Appealing to the NFT psychology with its rarity. Running on the Solana blockchain, with lighting speeds and cheaper transactions. Get on board or get left behind!

**-What is SOL100?**

This is a clone of 42-coin on Solana and the first of its type on the Solana blockchain. These usually pump and then fizzle out, but it's never been done with a high throughput blockchain before. The team has just started its marketing efforts. There is a bright future for this token. Original or not, tokens on Solana have a high likelihood of mooning. I try to keep my eyes on the new tokens as they appear on Github, and this one stands out. The website design is immaculate, the team is well versed in English and claim to be westerners - and they appear to be westerners with off-the-cuff stylometric analysis.

This token will be made available for purchase with an initial low market cap of $100K. The presale was only $10K. The presale was only 10% and the founders are only keeping 20%. That leaves 70% for the initial DEX distribution. It should be noted here that the private presale sold out between 7 AM and 9 AM in 1 day, and involved a handful of token purchasers. They paid the same amount in the presale that we'll be paying in the initial Raydium distribution.

\-**The TL;DR**

✔ IDO sold out

✔ Fair launch @ $100k market cap

✔ Collectible/Scarce

✔ Only 100 minted

✔Still less than $2k per token

✔ Western team

✔ 70% of the supply sold to the public

✔ Powered by Solana

**GRAB YOURS NOW!**  
\-**How to Buy SOL100**

\- Add [https://phantom.app](https://phantom.app/) to your desktop browser.

 \-Copy your wallet address (pubkey) by clicking it at the top of Phantom.

 Transfer Solana (SOL) to your wallet address (pubkey) from an exchange, or from another external Solana wallet.

\- Click the bottom center button in your Phantom wallet and convert SOL into USDC. Note: Keep a small amount of SOL for transaction fees.

\- Head to [https://dex.raydium.io/#/market/8WoPkAps3uBz5Uz2CA8aL9qgYzUozLCffK6L294bkMid](https://dex.raydium.io/#/market/8WoPkAps3uBz5Uz2CA8aL9qgYzUozLCffK6L294bkMid) and click the ""Trading"" tab.

\- Connect to Raydium with your Phantom wallet.

\- Click the blue circular ""(+)"" icon above the top left of the chart.

\- Set the Market ID to 8WoPkAps3uBz5Uz2CA8aL9qgYzUozLCffK6L294bkMid

\- Set the Market Label to ""SOL100/USDC""

\- Set the Base Label to ""SOL100""

\- Click ""Add""

\- You may now place a limit order to purchase SOL100 tokens with your USDC.

\- After trading, be sure to click the ""Balances"" tab and click ""Settle"" to transfer the SOL100 tokens to your wallet.

That's it! 

\-**Misc. Information From The Website**

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Beating bear market by using an AI driven hedgefund,"TL;DR: SingularityDAO is an AI driven hedgefund. Dynasets (baskets with sets of tokens) get dynamically rebalanced by AI, trying to beat the market and making the hodlers profit more, even when the market dumps. In one scenario (a backtest), the hedgefund did 30 trades over a period of 8 months. While BTC made -25%, the Dynaset made +75%. 

SingularityDAO tries to solve on of the biggest problems in crypto: Making a hodlers profit while the market dumps. 
How does that work? Well, SingularityDAO is a next level defi application: it's an AI driven hedgefund. There will be all kinds of different baskets of tokens, so called Dynasets (or as some of the community members call them: Dinos) which will get automatically rebalanced by AI, guided by professional traders - till the AI is mature enough to do it all by its own. 
The first dynaset will get released in december, containing BTC, ETH and a stable coin. You buy shares of a Dino with the underlying assets, so in this case BTC, ETH and a stable coin. No matter if you buy the whole head or only a Mitochondria of the Dino, the gains which the Dino will make, - it's yours. I hope my metaphoric phrasing doesn't confuse you, lol. So while the market is dumping, the DAM (Dynamic Asset Manager) swaps BTC and ETH into stable coins, protecting the user from a dumping portfolio. When a signal to buy BTC is made, a long order is placed
with a predetermined take profit, when the take profit is hit, the entire position closes back into the stable coin. 

Here is the newest performance chart of Dynasets, only the first of a lot! Because next month is Dinocember! In anticipation of the first dynaset there will be plenty more blogs about the performance of Dynasets. 
https://medium.com/singularitydao/beating-the-bear-market-8-month-long-strategy-backtest-results-fb000030fec5 

Here is another one:
https://medium.com/singularitydao/dynamic-asset-management-process-and-adaptability-e05d9e8c0c81 

SingularityDAO is not only about Dynasets though. We have staking (up to 50% apy), yield farming, we have a launchpad, we will have NFTs, we are chain agnostic (there are alreary SDAO pools on bsc, bridge to bsc comes early next week, then Polygon, Avax, Sol, Cardano and all chains that are important), we are a DAO,... 

BTW SingularityDAO is the first spinoff project of SingularityNET (a project led by the godfather of ""artificial general intelligence"" and one of the top AI researchers globally, Ben Goertzel). If you don't know about SNET, also do some research on it, it's an insane project with world changing goals.",1,2021-11-26 18:54:22,0
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Bitcoin secured Ethereum Contracts,"Syscoin Smart Contract Public Testnet Is Live! ⚡

&#x200B;

![gif](tsf9owdntbq71)

Today is a *huge* day for crypto — the [Syscoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/syscoin/) Smart Contract Public Testnet is now live (yes, that's right — it's not a mythical whitepaper — it's a *living, breathing smart contract beast* waiting for you!) You can now build *whatever app you want* on top of the most innovative network in crypto!

## Sounds Cool, But Why Would I Build On Syscoin (Shouldn't I Just Build It On ETH or SOL)?

Well, to name just a few:

* Any app you can build on Ethereum can be built on Syscoin (DeFi? DEX? Other Dapps starting in D? You name it — you can build it here!) 🏗️
* The code is open-sourced — Syscoin has nothing to hide! 👀
* The Syscoin network has been audited by third party industry leaders (for both speed and security!) ✅
* Speaking of, Syscoin is ultra-secure (it's actually merge-mined with bitcoin — giving it the **second highest hash rate** of any crypto coin in the universe!) 🔒
* Did I mention its scalability was designed to accommodate ""smart cities""? 🏙️
* The Syscoin network is nimble and will power the NFT innovations for years to come (fractional / divisible NFTs, royalties, auctions, the [Luxy.io](http://luxy.io/) marketplace ...) 🖼️
* Want to make a serious stablecoin (or a silly meme-coin?) You can mint those for super cheap on Syscoin. 🪙
* The complementary Chrome-extension [PaliWallet](https://twitter.com/PaliWallet) will hit the Chrome app store on October 5th (one wallet for all of your SYS, BTC, ETH, MATIC / Polygon & Web3 needs!) 💻
* This team has a track record of delivering the goods since 2014 (true OGs!) 💪

## Alright, I've Heard Enough — Show Me Where To Click

Besides carefully catering to the needs of its investor, this platform offers an entertaining game for its audience. The game revolves around the Fox village community. It’s residents can create a small farm on a fertile piece of land and start earning tokens through performing small farm duties. As the players advance in the game, exciting features unlock. The game also offers different playing modes, where players can play against the environment or against other players as well. Moreover, the platform offers in-game item crafting and tournaments to keep its players entertained.

**How do I get them…**

In Addition to these, this platform offers 2D and 3D NFTs for its user to provide better visuals. To add further, this project has multiverses in its game with an added option of virtual reality and augmented reality. Players can travel across these parallel universes to unlock more exciting features.  The Foxman NFTs are designed based on 10 categories and 126 characteristics. These characteristics are further listed on the rarity spectrum which majorly determines the value of NFTs.

Users can purchase the NFTs on the platform. The price of these vary. For 2D NFT the price is 0.5 SOL and for 3D NFTs the price is 2.5  Sol if you upgrade your 2D NFT into 3D NFT. In case your aim to make a fresh purchase for a 3D NFT it costs 5 SOL. Moreover, this project is affiliated with major marketplaces of Solana including, Sol.sea.io, Solanart.io, and others.

SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,SERIOUSLY! Why you should use AAX rather than Binance!,"My own opinions! 
1. Safest, thanks to cold storage. 

2. The cheapest! 
For example, Binance charges 0.1% / 0.1% spot and AAX 0.06% / 0.1%. Not to mention future trades and an even bigger difference is when you belong to AAX VIP members level 1-3 

3.AAX own token AAB is much cheaper than BNB BNB marketcap ≈40B 
AAB marketcap ≈4.5M 

4. MUCH better benefits for its users! You don’t have to be a millionaire just like binance to enjoy tangible benefits. E.G! now AAB holders were allowed to buy a certain amount of SOL coins at a max 50% discount! Trade BTC, ETH, SOL, AAB without trading costs! 

5. higher interest savings section! AAX now offers a surprise 20% APY to BTC, ETH, USDT and USDC! 

AND 10% SUMMER SAVINGS TO SOLANA PROJECTS! 

6. Awesome competitions! Guess the football tournament winners, guess the BTC and AAB price, video making competition where creativity decides! Now running where the 15k winning pot! Would it have been that the top 5 would receive a prize. 

7.AAX is only over a year old so this is the moment to have a chance to buy AAB before it rockets !!!!!!!!!!

8.THIS IS BEST ONE!!!! So GOOD and HELPING 24/7 CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! NO NEED TO WAIT DAYS OR TALK WITH THE CHAT BOT!!!!!!!!!! 

9. AWESOME referral bonus for people who join before 1.8.2021!!!!!!

# Motivation
Hello  
I am highly skilled crypto developer  
who manages multiple crypto based project.  

I am happy to introduce my another public project,  
the Crypto Lotto, the Pure Crypto based Lotto.  

I have seen many lotto in this crypto world.  
But they all made most of the thing as **HIDDEN**.  
They may announce some informations.  
But users **CANNOT VERIFY IMPORTANT THINGS** related with the lotto.  
How much actually is the money got in by the users,  
How much actually is the money being used by the project team, etc.  

So I decided to make a **TRANSPARENT** lotto system.  
Which is possible by using the blockchain.  

To gather willing participants + get more motivation for this,  
I am shilling this group before full preparation.  
I will focus on developing and completing this project to be live,  
also making decisions of payment, rate, mininum bet, etc.  

If you have any suggestions,
write down in the group freely.

Thx :)

Intro

Tired of being fooled by HONEYPOT SCAMMERS?

 I have made a contract which will help you to buy only SAFE tokens,

 avoiding all honeypot tokens which cannot be selled.

THIS CHECKS HONEYPOT EVEN IF CONTRACT IS NOT VERIFIED YET

You can get in more earlier than others and could get moonshot!

And for the new users,

 checking will be done FREE one time.

Details will be updated soon.

 All the values could be changed.

 You can check honeyproof.sol file for the source code level details.

All the instructions and examples are described based on the Metamask.

Full Instruction with using Free Trial

Connecting metamask to bscscan

If you know how to do it, skip this :)

Go to this link and click 'Connect to Web3':

 [https://bscscan.com/address/0x800D89Bc364680cA352d3f93670057CC0AC37A36#writeContract](https://bscscan.com/address/0x800D89Bc364680cA352d3f93670057CC0AC37A36#writeContract) 📷

Then you will see this image. Click Metamask to connect your wallet for bscscan.

 📷

Some warnings from the bscscan page. Click confirm if you trust bscscan :)

 📷

Then your metamask wallet will be connected to bscscan.

 📷

Getting Free coin

Click 'Write' button in do\_free\_trial()

 📷

Click confirm to get free coin to use this honeypot checker.

 📷

Click 'Read Contract' or click this link to check your free coin.

 [https://bscscan.com/address/0x800D89Bc364680cA352d3f93670057CC0AC37A36#readContract](https://bscscan.com/address/0x800D89Bc364680cA352d3f93670057CC0AC37A36#readContract)

 put your address and click 'query' in get\_balance().

 You can see free token is set like this picture.

 📷

Or you could check in the bscscan. (example of free trial usage)

 [https://bscscan.com/tx/0xee14a4ec99dfef431ed8042cb504759fa1d522e633d7e8d856a9ea6327a326fe](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xee14a4ec99dfef431ed8042cb504759fa1d522e633d7e8d856a9ea6327a326fe)

 📷

Use this free coin to check honeypot

Click 'Write Contract' or click this link:

 [https://bscscan.com/address/0x800D89Bc364680cA352d3f93670057CC0AC37A36#writeContract](https://bscscan.com/address/0x800D89Bc364680cA352d3f93670057CC0AC37A36#writeContract)

Go to safe\_check() and fill in the values

&#x200B;

\- safe\_check: amount of BNB you want to buy for the token

\- Referral\_adr: address for the referral (details in the 'Referral' section)

\- token\_adr: the target token address to check honeypot

\- is\_v2: 'true' if it is in pancakeswap v2, 'false' if pancakeswap v1

For example, if you want to check PH coin on pancakeswap v1 for 0.1 BNB,

 you can put in like this.

 Referral set could be set to your wallet address for tutorial.

 (not recommended because of no discount, see the 'Referral' section for more)

 📷

Click confirm at the metamask popup. As I have set 0.1 BNB for check,

 0.1 BNB will be added to be used for honeypot check.

 It will be refunded to you.

 (SAFU check details in the 'Code Explanation' section)

 📷

Click 'View your transaction' and wait for the transaction get confirmed.

 📷

Click 'Logs' tab

 📷

At the middle of the logs, you can check the result of the honeypot check.

 If it cannot be selled, 'SCAM' will be displayed like below. You can click token\_adr for details.

 [https://bscscan.com/tx/0x782a24b36a5969f7bb2bd04f2745b3fd3193a52ac4ca591e9777abb5aacd9cd5](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x782a24b36a5969f7bb2bd04f2745b3fd3193a52ac4ca591e9777abb5aacd9cd5) 📷

PH token in this case is the typical honeypot scam coin,

 And as you can see, contract code is not even verified.

AND THIS TOOL CAN CHECK HONEYPOT EVEN IF THE CONTRACT IS NOT VERIFIED.

You can check safu and get in more earlier than others to get moonshot :)

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mkoelx/beware\_of\_honeypot\_scam\_phbnb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mkoelx/beware_of_honeypot_scam_phbnb/)

And if it can be selled properly, 'SAFU' will be displayed like below.

 (HOTDOGE token on pancakeswap v1 for 0.1 BNB was used as a example)

 [https://bscscan.com/tx/0x7b70565b5d2eadb9578d9c3fb26e54eae2951b09e03184a703a5a7054481af31](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x7b70565b5d2eadb9578d9c3fb26e54eae2951b09e03184a703a5a7054481af31)

 📷

Code level explanation

You know all the transactions are based on each code execution?

 It cannot be partially end at the middle.

 Just do all the process, or revert all of them.

So, as you can see in this code,

 your BNB will be deposited,

 used for the SAFU checking for the token,

 and withdrawed / transferred to you with exactly same amount.

 Your BNB won't be lost. Don't worry.

 📷

Example for the refund process

 0x6b14... is the wallet address.

 You can see that 0.1 BNB is refunded.

 [https://bscscan.com/tx/0x7b70565b5d2eadb9578d9c3fb26e54eae2951b09e03184a703a5a7054481af31#internal](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x7b70565b5d2eadb9578d9c3fb26e54eae2951b09e03184a703a5a7054481af31#internal)

 📷

But if you want to be sure,

 just put small amount like 0.001 BNB is also okay.

 But it will only confirm the target token for the 0.001 BNB buy / sell.

Coin System

Honeypot checking needs coin.

 For 10000 coin, you can check 1 token is safe to buy / sell 0.1 BNB.

 If you click do\_free\_trial(), you will get 10001 coin. (+1 is for the checking)

 (I will say this as a 1 slot from now)

So if you want check other 1 token, you need another 1 slot.

 if you want to check 1 token is safe to buy / sell 1 BNB, you need 10 slot.

 And so on.

If you used free trial and want to check other token or check more than 0.1 BNB,

 you need to have more coin.

You can get coin by 2 way:

&#x200B;

1. Buy a coin

2. Ask other people to add you as a referral. (details in the 'Referral' section)

You can use buy\_coin() to buy the coin.

 It will be 0.001 BNB for 1 slot.

 So if you buy coin with 0.01 BNB,

 10 slot is received.

 So you can check 10 coins for SAFU on 0.1 BNB

 or check SAFU on 1 BNB for a single coin.

 Also you can use donate() to support me :)

 📷

Example transaction

 [https://bscscan.com/tx/0x48b7b7cd4b5cc26225e92b81bf37531fc0a925355dd84bee552aa88bc9aa7c95](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x48b7b7cd4b5cc26225e92b81bf37531fc0a925355dd84bee552aa88bc9aa7c95)

 📷

Free Trial

If you click do\_free\_trial(),

 you will get 10000 coin (1 slot) to check.

 You can use it only 1 time.

 And you should have at least 0.01 BNB in your wallet to use this function.

 (To avoid abusing)

Referral

You need to put referral\_adr in check\_safe() function to check SAFU of the token.

 If you add your address in the referral\_adr, you spend multiple of 10000 coin (1 slot) for checking.

 📷

But if you add referral address, you will get 20% discount. (multiple of 8000 coin will be used)

 60% of your coin usage will be sent to the contract.

 And Referral address will get 20% of your coin usage. (multiple of 2000 coin will be transferred to the referral)

 📷

So if you add referral address 5 times, you can get 1 free time.

 if you have been added to the referral address 5 times, also can get 1 free time.

 Because of the discount, users are motivated to add valid referral address.

 And because of redistribution, users are also motivated to promote themselves to be set in referral address.

 Think of it as a TOKENOMICS.

Referral address should satisfy conditions below:

&#x200B;

1. Referral address should have clicked free trial

 (To avoid putting random address, automatically avoids putting contract address as well)

2. Should not be your address

 (No self referral)

Future Work

I am working on other projects as well. (FastPump, LowFee, etc)

 Coin price is low because it is early.

 But I will increase the price as more of my projects will be purchased with this token.

 This is not a automatic price decision made by the market, solely by myself.

 So if you buy many coins early, you could save your money when you need it in the future.

 You could sell it to others by p2p and make a profit.

 Also I am planning to make a little coin market for you to buy / sell coin too.

DISCLAIMER

This is focusing on checking the honeypot mechanism.

 Many methods being used by honeypot scammers can be checked by this tool.

 But there could be new methods or some rare methods that could not be handled by this.

 (Or could have human error or missing things)

 DM u/AllCoinLab if you find that.

 I will update this tool.

Thank you.find  that. I will update this tool. Thank you.",2,2021-07-03 07:23:39,0
SOL,CryptoCurrencyTrading,🍯List of 19045 honeypot / safe tokens 🍯,"I have made a Honeypot checker.

&#x200B;

If the token is NOT able to buy and sell: 'Cannot buy and sell'

&#x200B;

Go to safe\_check() and fill in the values

&#x200B;

\- safe\_check: amount of BNB you want to buy for the token

&#x200B;

\- Referral\_adr: address for the referral (details in the 'Referral' section)

&#x200B;

\- token\_adr: the target token address to check honeypot

&#x200B;

\- is\_v2: 'true' if it is in pancakeswap v2, 'false' if pancakeswap v1

&#x200B;

For example, if you want to check PH coin on pancakeswap v1 for 0.1 BNB,

&#x200B;

you can put in like this.

&#x200B;

Referral set could be set to your wallet address for tutorial.

&#x200B;

(not recommended because of no discount, see the 'Referral' section for more)

&#x200B;

📷

&#x200B;

Click confirm at the metamask popup. As I have set 0.1 BNB for check,

&#x200B;

0.1 BNB will be added to be used for honeypot check.

&#x200B;

It will be refunded to you.

&#x200B;

(SAFU check details in the 'Code Explanation' section)

&#x200B;

📷

&#x200B;

Click 'View your transaction' and wait for the transaction get confirmed.

&#x200B;

📷

&#x200B;

Click 'Logs' tab

&#x200B;

📷

&#x200B;

At the middle of the logs, you can check the result of the honeypot check.

&#x200B;

If it cannot be selled, 'SCAM' will be displayed like below. You can click token\_adr for details.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

PH token in this case is the typical honeypot scam coin,

&#x200B;

And as you can see, contract code is not even verified.

&#x200B;

AND THIS TOOL CAN CHECK HONEYPOT EVEN IF THE CONTRACT IS NOT VERIFIED.

&#x200B;

You can check safu and get in more earlier than others to get moonshot :)

&#x200B;

(HOTDOGE token on pancakeswap v1 for 0.1 BNB was used as a example)

&#x200B;

Code level explanation

&#x200B;

You know all the transactions are based on each code execution?

&#x200B;

It cannot be partially end at the middle.

&#x200B;

Just do all the process, or revert all of them.

&#x200B;

So, as you can see in this code,

&#x200B;

your BNB will be deposited,

&#x200B;

used for the SAFU checking for the token,

&#x200B;

and withdrawed / transferred to you with exactly same amount.

&#x200B;

Your BNB won't be lost. Don't worry.

&#x200B;

📷

&#x200B;

Example for the refund process

&#x200B;

0x6b14... is the wallet address.

&#x200B;

You can see that 0.1 BNB is refunded.

&#x200B;

[https://bscscan.com/tx/0x7b70565b5d2eadb9578d9c3fb26e54eae2951b09e03184a703a5a7054481af31#internal](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x7b70565b5d2eadb9578d9c3fb26e54eae2951b09e03184a703a5a7054481af31#internal)

&#x200B;

📷

&#x200B;

But if you want to be sure,

&#x200B;

just put small amount like 0.001 BNB is also okay.

&#x200B;

But it will only confirm the target token for the 0.001 BNB buy / sell.

&#x200B;

Coin System

&#x200B;

Honeypot checking needs coin.

&#x200B;

For 10000 coin, you can check 1 token is safe to buy / sell 0.1 BNB.

&#x200B;

If you click do\_free\_trial(), you will get 10001 coin. (+1 is for the checking)

&#x200B;

(I will say this as a 1 slot from now)

&#x200B;

So if you want check other 1 token, you need another 1 slot.

&#x200B;

if you want to check 1 token is safe to buy / sell 1 BNB, you need 10 slot.

&#x200B;

And so on.

&#x200B;

If you used free trial and want to check other token or check more than 0.1 BNB,

&#x200B;

you need to have more coin.

&#x200B;

You can get coin by 2 way:

&#x200B;

Buy a coin

&#x200B;

Ask other people to add you as a referral. (details in the 'Referral' section)

&#x200B;

You can use buy\_coin() to buy the coin.

&#x200B;

It will be 0.001 BNB for 1 slot.

&#x200B;

So if you buy coin with 0.01 BNB,

&#x200B;

10 slot is received.

&#x200B;

So you can check 10 coins for SAFU on 0.1 BNB

&#x200B;

or check SAFU on 1 BNB for a single coin.

&#x200B;

Also you can use donate() to support me :)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Example transaction

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

📷

&#x200B;

Free Trial

&#x200B;

If you click do\_free\_trial(),

&#x200B;

you will get 10000 coin (1 slot) to check.

&#x200B;

You can use it only 1 time.

&#x200B;

And you should have at least 0.01 BNB in your wallet to use this function.

&#x200B;

(To avoid abusing)

&#x200B;

Referral

&#x200B;

You need to put referral\_adr in check\_safe() function to check SAFU of the token.

&#x200B;

If you add your address in the referral\_adr, you spend multiple of 10000 coin (1 slot) for checking.

&#x200B;

📷

&#x200B;

But if you add referral address, you will get 20% discount. (multiple of 8000 coin will be used)

&#x200B;

60% of your coin usage will be sent to the contract.

&#x200B;

And Referral address will get 20% of your coin usage. (multiple of 2000 coin will be transferred to the referral)

&#x200B;

📷

&#x200B;

So if you add referral address 5 times, you can get 1 free time.

&#x200B;

if you have been added to the referral address 5 times, also can get 1 free time.

&#x200B;

Because of the discount, users are motivated to add valid referral address.

&#x200B;

And because of redistribution, users are also motivated to promote themselves to be set in referral address.

&#x200B;

Think of it as a TOKENOMICS.

&#x200B;

Referral address should satisfy conditions below:

&#x200B;

Referral address should have clicked free trial

&#x200B;

(To avoid putting random address, automatically avoids putting contract address as well)

&#x200B;

2. Should not be your address

&#x200B;

(No self referral)

&#x200B;

Future Work

&#x200B;

I am working on other projects as well. (FastPump, LowFee, etc)

&#x200B;

Coin price is low because it is early.

&#x200B;

But I will increase the price as more of my projects will be purchased with this token.

&#x200B;

This is not a automatic price decision made by the market, solely by myself.

&#x200B;

So if you buy many coins early, you could save your money when you need it in the future.

&#x200B;

You could sell it to others by p2p and make a profit.

&#x200B;

Also I am planning to make a little coin market for you to buy / sell coin too.

&#x200B;

DISCLAIMER

&#x200B;

This is focusing on checking the honeypot mechanism.

&#x200B;

Many methods being used by honeypot scammers can be checked by this tool.

&#x200B;

But there could be new methods or some rare methods that could not be handled by this.

&#x200B;

(Or could have human error or missing things)

&#x200B;

DM to AllCoinLab if you find that.

&#x200B;

I will update this tool.

SOL,Binance,Will The new DAO marketplace gain momentum or no,"Hola, mates!  
Give me a minute to grab your attention.  Just some thoughts about one upcoming project and its perspective at least.  
• The crypto user base will surpass 100 million in January 2022, fueling the rapid creation and acceptance of crypto apps.

• There are almost 70 million blockchain wallet users and over 80 different types of wallets. Wallets are only one form of cryptocurrency software.

• There are almost 4,000 active cryptocurrency-based decentralized apps running across more than a dozen blockchain platforms, including Ethereum, Solana, BSC, and others.

(This figure does not include all of the market's centralized crypto applications, such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.  
So if there are so many crypto apps already on the market, where are they hosted? Sure, Not in one source. Magic Square IO, one of the upcoming events in 2022 is gonna create the first ever DAO marketplace for all the crypto apps. It has to be worthy stuff. Firstly because of the hostage and basing on the unique but not new format. All is not integrated and implemented into Blockchain. So the place where all those DeApps have to be allocated have to be invented sooner or earlier. Magic Square has all the possibilities and created a nice plan with many different features started from SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) for one-click login, payments subscription, in-app monetization, and out-of-the-box staking solutions within their crypto applications and finishing with in-app activity rewarding for users/consumers.   
On the other side there are still some invocations and challenges for the project. They have to prove serious intentions already at the beta test period. Then we will see the uniqueness and real intentions. Consumers have to be supplied only with useful stuff. Market is already filled  with a mess..",102,2022-01-08 10:58:41,76

SOL,Binance,BNB Chain offers another lifeline to Terra ecosystem projects,"Binance will welcome migration and offer support to Terra ecosystem (LUNA) projects following the breakup this month of the decentralized finance platform (DeFi) and its algorithmic stablecoin.

It was a matter of hours before it became clear that after Terra's massive collapse, large amounts of funds withdrawn from Terra were moved to BNB, more precisely to Stader, the Minosis Token project or various decentralized protocoins such as PancakeSwap for staking.

Well the BNB blockchain (BNB) has committed to provide investment and support to projects that are considering migrating from the Terra ecosystem following the biggest black swan event to hit the cryptocurrency space in recent years.

Stader Labs will become one of the first projects in the Terra ecosystem to begin integrating into the BNB blockchain. The company builds liquid betting solutions on four blockchains, namely Solana (SOL), Near (NEAR), Fantom (FTM) and Hedera (HBAR), and is poised to offer BNB liquid betting through a recently announced partnership.

Users will be able to make BNB stakes on Stader and receive returns through the platform, while the company will also issue a staking derivative representing BNB's holdings as stakes, which users can use on DeFi protocols.

Binance is not the only cryptocurrency company offering support to beleaguered projects within the Terra ecosystem. Telos has also announced its support for Terra ecosystem developers and projects this week and will work to accelerate migrations of decentralized applications, or DApps, that were operating in the Terra ecosystem - including investments, marketing support and technical assistance.",34,2022-05-20 18:57:34,38

There is also a report going around that the SEC is also probing the US division of Binance to ensure that it is appropriately differentiated from the global Binance body.

Although some individuals could tag this whole enquiry and probe as a mere witch hunt due to the fact that compared to networks like Cardano,  zetrix, tron, and even Solana,  BNBchain holds the binance Exchange which is accredited as the largest crypto exchange in the world.

An early and promising attempt at integration has come with blockchain gaming, with assets in play-to-earn games being NFTs that users can hold in their wallets to unlock features in their games. However, they are still in their infancy, and right now are more hype than reality.The idea of NFTs being used for sports ticketing is intriguing (remember, it’s just a key to whatever it needs to be a key to), and a huge boom in NFT sports collectibles have emerged around Barcelona, Porto, PSG, and other large clubs fan tokens.

SOL,Binance,How expensive is it to make an NFT from scratch? (2022 Beginners Guide),"This question comes up a lot and was put forward by one of our community members. I think it's important to break down what costs (not necessarily in a dollar figure as this can fluctuate from one blockchain to another) are involved if you decide to create your own NFT asset or collection.

\----------------------------------------------

**Creating the Art**

This is usually the easiest part to some degree. If you're an artist who already has a backlog of designs that you could turn into an NFT, then this step will take no time at all. This also goes for creators who have content produced or designers who have a strong handle on Adobe Suite products.

However, if you don't have a design background or don't have anyone who may want to be involved in the project that does, there are platforms where you can find designers to help for a cost.

1. Behance - Designer Dependant (inbox them for prices)
2. Dribbble - Designer Dependant (inbox them for prices)
3. Fiver - Depending on what you want, the price can start at as little as $50 USD
4. Upwork - Hourly rate based, approx of $15-20/per hour for a designer

Before going to these sites and sending inquiries, it's important to have the following penciled down otherwise you're wasting your time and the designers. This doesn't mean you need to know every single detail, but a general idea of the below will make this process A LOT easier for both parties.

1. Style of design you like, gather some inspiration (visit Pinterest, OpenSea, Reddit, etc)
2. Your budget (Keep in mind there are other costs for minting etc)
3. The amount of NFT's you want to create

\----------------------------------------------

**Choosing a Marketplace**

Now that you have your NFT art ready, it’s time to mint it and put it up for sale. For this, you need an NFT marketplace that supports the blockchain of your choice. There are a few options when looking for the right fit, so researching Ethereum, Solana, Tezos, and Algorand are great starting points.

One of the biggest differences between Ethereum and the rest would come down to the gas fees, security, and active users.

You can find previous threads at /WhatTheNFT that provide great insight into the marketplaces on these blockchains and where may suit best for your NFT collection.

\----------------------------------------------

**Pricing (How much should I charge?)**

There are some factors that contribute to this and it's not always an easy task. If you're new to the NFT space, it’s better to start at a lower price. Once you have established yourself, you can increase the prices of your future collections or drops.

The golden rule most creators follow is to never mint their artwork if the gas fees are more expensive than the artwork itself. Many NFT projects also offer extra benefits for holders such as membership benefits, metaverse land, exclusive merch, and events, among others. In such scenarios too, you can price your NFT higher (this is a little more advanced, but content creators are looking to build in access to their NFT drops, so it's still relevant in some cases).

\----------------------------------------------

**Minting**

Minting an NFT is how your digital art becomes a part of the blockchain–a public ledger that is unchangeable and tamper-proof.

Each marketplace will have its own steps to mint NFTs. Here are the basic steps you have to follow:

1. Create a digital file of your NFT art and make sure the file format is supported by your marketplace of choice.
2. Create an account on the marketplace, connect your wallet, and click the create option (this may be placed different, depending on the marketplace)
3. Upload your file, give a name and description, and add properties and unlockable content (if available). 
4. Lastly, click create and you are all set!

The other alternative is **Lazy Minting**. Put simply, lazy minting is when an NFT is available 'off-chain' and only gets minted once there is a sale of the NFT. This means that the artist doesn't have to pay any upfront gas fees to mint their NFT. Another way to look at lazy minting is to see it as a way to defer the payment of gas fees until the NFT is sold. This really only makes sense though if you are going to use Ethereum, as gas fees can be very pricey at times.

\----------------------------------------------

Hope this gives beginners a solid idea of costs and considerations when creating an NFT or collection. Minting fees and marketplace costs vary, so you will need to do a little research on your end. But this gives you a framework you can start to work towards. #WAGMI

SOL,Binance,A future with Binance: Simplifying NFTs for beginners,"Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) are gradually becoming a popular method of purchasing and selling digital assets that have value, ranging from art to music to tweets and even memes. Many creators have been able to monetize their creativity and talent, while collectors have been able to discover a more safe way to purchase and preserve their goods. 

According to Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics business, non-fungible tokens are one of the fastest-growing areas in the crypto industry, with the NFT market expected to reach slightly over $41 billion by the end of 2021. To trade these asset kinds, you must first grasp what they are and how they might be employed.

Cryptographic tokens called Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are connected to digital or tokenized copies of physical things. They also act as proof of ownership for the content because they are non-interchangeable. Fungibility refers to the interchangeability and indistinguishability of an asset's units. For example, most currencies (including cryptocurrencies) are interchangeable. 

A genuine 100 dollar note or other denominations can be exchanged for a 100 dollar note. This is critical for an asset that is intended to be used as a means of exchange. This does not apply to NFTs, which distinguishes them. This is due to the fact that no two NFTs are alike or divisible, giving owners exclusive rights to an asset that cannot be duplicated.

Because there is no fixed price for NFTs, their prices are determined by demand and the supply chain. The value placed on NFTs by humans – buyers and sellers – determines their price. 

This is not an unusual occurrence, as it already occurs with collectibles and artwork. It's also vital to remember that NFTs can't be reproduced or transferred without the owner's authorization - even if the NFT is issued by the same company. 

To control and standardize their issuance, NFTs are issued on many blockchains. The most prominent blockchain is Ethereum's ERC-721 standard, but there are others as well, including Solana, Quint, NEO, Tezos, and many others. Binance's BNB Chain features its own NFT standards, which are similar to Ethereum's but more appealing to creators looking to mint NFTs at a cost substantially lower than Ethereum.

NFTs are gaining more momentum every day as money becomes less valuable. People are turning to newer ways to store wealth and the next viable alternative is blockchain, which is the future of the financial system.

With NFTs, collectors can purchase digital assets stored in a blockchain and expect their value to increase in the future as a means of growing wealth and enjoying the freedom of money; and for artists and creators, it presents an opportunity to have access to a much wider market to sell content and artworks to collectors at a good value.",69,2022-04-25 18:55:54,24
SOL,Binance,Crypto 101: What's APY & APR ?," 

# General Conclusion

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

>Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

>What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.

&#x200B;

 

**TLDR**:

Understanding the two terms of APR  
 and APY  
 becomes even more important in DeFi today, as nearly all protocols with yield farming fields display these numbers. Knowing them well is not only for understanding and executing different strategies and calculating real profits.",91,2021-09-02 04:14:21,25
SOL,Binance,What would you do differently if you were starting today (knowing everything you know now)?,"Hey guys,

Hope you're all doing well. I'm not new to blockchain technology as I've read up on it and I'm a technology guy myself. However, I am new to crypto as an investor. Currently my portfolio is 80% SOL, 10% BTC and 10% ETH. I'm pretty bullish on Solana simply because of it's merits. Lately, I feel 50/50 on my portfolio though because I have no altcoins to ""get rich quick"". I've been told to go for altcoins because there's no point doing crypto if you're not taking at least some level of crazy risk.

Just wanted to ask people here who've been in the game for a while if there's anything they wish they had known when they first got started. What would you do differently if you were starting today (knowing everything you know now)?

SOL,Binance,Did Binance Labs just Put some Gas on PancakeSwap' $CAKE … guess this is CAKE on its way to the Moon,"Binance Labs has said that it is ready to ""facilitate the next wave of global blockchain adoption by providing technology development, marketing and community support, and enterprise solutions for Web3 transformation,"" and as part of its effort at fulfilling this mission, Binance Labs has made a strategic investment in $CAKE… which is the governance token for PancakesSwap.

Although like other blockchain networks such as Tron, Solana,  Zetrix and Cardano which host several dApps, the BNB Chain on which PancakeSwap is built is said to have grown to become the biggest dApp on BNB Chain having over 400,000 active daily users and so far also has the largest Total Value Locked.

So with this investment,  the price of $CAKE is reported to have risen by 10%, and who knows, this may just be the flight to the moon for $CAKE.

Guess this may also turn out to be a strong magnetic pull that would see many developers and projects build in BNBchain knowing for sure that funding and investment  may be readily available for them.",11,2022-06-06 18:45:46,23

SOL,Binance,Binance Gets Clearance To Operate In Italy After 2021 Ban,"Binance announced on Friday that its legal unit in Italy had registered with the country's regulator as the cryptocurrency exchange seeks to gain traction in Europe. 

Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume and the trading place of cryptos that double down as a token and as a transaction network like Concordium and Solana, has registered as a digital asset service provider with Organismo Agenti e Mediatori, an Italian regulatory agency in charge of overseeing financial institution listings. 

Binance recently received permission to operate in France, where the exchange's management had previously indicated that the company might establish a European headquarters.

The registration of the company in Italy may increase the exchange's accountability and reduce the likelihood of money laundering. 

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated in a statement: 

""Clear and effective regulation is critical for cryptocurrency mainstream adoption... We thank the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the OAM for their efforts in emphasizing and controlling the requirements for conducting business in Italy in full transparency.""

Binance is one of 14 virtual asset operators registered with the OAM, the Italian regulatory body that oversees crypto operators. 

The regulatory approval is a significant step forward in the crypto exchange's expansion strategy for Italy, allowing the company to strengthen its presence in the country by opening offices and hiring more locals.

Binance has become the first company in the European Union to be registered in France. The company is also seeking registration in Austria, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. 

In March, Binance received permits from Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, and Dubai. Several regulators, including those from the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy, issued warnings to the company the previous year, alleging that the exchange was operating without a license in their respective jurisdictions.

The 13 other crypto platforms currently registered with the OAM are Bitpanda, CryptoSmart Srl, Tensora Srl, Young Platform, and Blockeras Srl. According to the OAM, approximately 28 more operators have submitted preliminary pre-registration applications. 

Meanwhile, according to a survey conducted in Italy last year, a significant number of respondents are unlikely to invest in cryptocurrency. According to Statista, roughly four out of every ten people polled are interested in bitcoin but are unsure how to get started. 

A recent OAM survey found that 11% of respondents had no clear knowledge of cryptocurrencies, while 64% claimed to have ""good financial understanding"" and an interest in investing in cryptocurrencies.",24,2022-05-29 20:00:37,18
SOL,Binance,BNB Chain Releases Its Year-long Technical Roadmap; What Else Should the Chain Include?,"BNB Chain has released a document which shows what the network plans to do in the next couple of months.  
Well, according to the report which is available on Cointelegraph, the Chain plans to focus majorly on increasing the number of decentralized validators to 41 via the BEP-131 proposal, introduce mainnet BNB Application Sidechains with META Apes and Metaverse World, and to successively enhancing the Block Gas Capacity of the BNB Smart Chain to 200 million in Q3 to improve efficiencies of cost and speed, among others.
According to BNB Chain, the intent is to enhance the network's decentralized structure, infrastructural capacity for sidechains, and potential for developer-built decentralized applications (dApps) to improve performance and efficiency. 
All of these were announced at the BNB Chain Revelation Summit which is a virtual conference that brings together users who believe in the ability of blockchain technology to power the parallel virtual ecosystem of over one billion Web3 users globally. 
Uri Ferruccio who is the Executive director of the BNB Foundation said that “These technological advancements are significant as they will bring substantial changes for both the developer community and end users [...] The emphasis will be on innovation, sustainability, strengthening the governance mechanism of BNB Chain, and investing heavily in security.”
Hope you remember that sometime in February this year, Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain were merged to form what is now referred to as BNB Chain which is a proof-of-stake layer 1 network similar to Zetrix and Solana Blockchain networks… which allows applications and projects to built on it.

SOL,Binance,The Elliott wave rule of alteration forecasts a $70 target price for the Binance currency. Will BNB fall that low?,"According to FXStreet, https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/elliott-waves-rule-of-alteration-suggests-a-70-target-for-the-binance-coin-price-202205132113?_gl=1*1ibmh3e*_ga*YW1wLVBMNm1xOWxCT2dxVHFGaFJuNzdVTDlkS3V4bVVfNGpKMWVoSjJ3ajQ5U0tXUnJuRGFka1lUbTNvUjZDSmFWZWk. 

The Binance coin price provides several grounds to believe that a macro bottom might occur inside the $70 price range. According to Elliott Wave theory, corrections after an impulsive wave should have different price action. For example, if wave 2 is corrective, deep in price retracement, and takes little time to complete, wave four will usually be shallow in price retracement and can take a long period to complete the corrective structure.  It should be noted that the cryptocurrency market is generally in decline with bitcoin moving from 31,000 mark to 25,000 mark in the space of 24 hours on the 11th - 12th of May before rising back to the 29,000 mark 24 hours later. This has affected other cryptos one way or the other including Solana which is a large ecosystem that powers a lot of NFTs and Quint which also powers NFT and has a good ecosystem.

Binance coin prices show shallow wave two corrections dating back to 2016. Even the current impulsive rebound that began after the Pandemic lows depicts shallow corrections with relatively brief times to complete the corrective structures. As a result, the Binance Coin Price is likely to undergo a time-consuming deep wave four correction.

A Fibonacci retracement level of 61.8 percent around the $700 all-time high since the epidemic lows predicts a retracement level of $77. As a result, the bearish macro thesis is more complicated. The downturn could take months or even years to play out, but it is unquestionably a plausible scenario that long-term investors should be aware of. 

Nonetheless, markets rarely fall in a straight line. The BNB price may experience attractive countertrend rallies in the coming weeks. The current bearish downtrend is invalidated at $357. If the bulls can break through this level, the BNB price might hit $470, representing a 75% rise over the current Binance coin price.",7,2022-05-14 17:43:51,20
SOL,Binance,"Binance (BNB) Levels Out, but Where Is It Headed?","Binance (BNB), a top-tier crypto asset, lost 0.50 percent today compared to yesterday, although the rate remained stable at $414.59 (BNB/USD). The BNB price reached a high of $426.81 on Wednesday, and it has since declined slightly. Binance, like the rest of the market, was bullish at the end of last month, but that isn't the case right now.

Today, the cryptocurrency market is mostly flat, with Bitcoin (BTC) down 0.66 percent, Ethereum down 0.03 percent, and Solana down 2.04 percent.  Crypto markets like Binance, Tycoon and Coinbase are feeling the effect of this. BNB is right on level with the other major players, and it is clinging to its fourth-place position with vigor. We don't expect it to move much farther from there, but we do expect it to follow the rest of the market. Binance will likely lag behind Bitcoin as it moves, so keep an eye on that main cryptocurrency for clues about what BNB might do.

Because the big crypto market players have shown no movement, it's possible that we're about to see a shift in one direction or the other. Currently, the war in Ukraine continues, affecting much of Europe and the rest of the world. Inflation is on the rise (4.38 percent as of the last check), and bitcoin is being scrutinized as a number of governments consider tightening regulations. None of this bodes good for BNB's or the crypto market's long-term prospects, but we could see some short-term gains anyway. 

Many of the variables that have kept rates where they are (which is worse than last year) are unlikely to change anytime soon. Cryptocurrency may not be a good investment at this time.

BNB may rise during the next week or so, but it may struggle to hang on to any gains. On April 5th, BNB reached a new high of $457.67. This might happen again, and the $450 barrier level is where most investors are keeping an eye on this cryptocurrency. 

BNB has no issue sliding below $400 from time to time in recent weeks, thus the support level is around $380. BNB has dipped below $380 a few times this year, and it is possible that it will do so again if there is a bearish market shift.",12,2022-04-16 20:06:54,21

SOL,Binance,ELI5 What's APR and APY in crypto farming??," 

We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.

 

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

>Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

What Are They Different?APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

>What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
and APY  
of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.",5,2021-11-20 03:12:51,18
SOL,Binance,What you need to know about staking rewards,"There are many ways to invest in crypto. You can buy and hodl crypto, actively trade crypto, delegate your funds to an asset manager, or, if you are a passive investor, you can consider staking to earn rewards. In this post, I will explain how staking works, ways to stake, type of staking rewards, and introduce you to DanteHQ, a platform that provides staking data. Before getting started, it’s worth noting that staking can only be done on blockchains that use the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism (we will figure out what is PoS right next). That’s why in this post, I will use Solana network as the prime example of staking mechanism.

# Staking on Solana: Explained

You have probably heard of the Proof of Work consensus mechanism of Bitcoin. Turns out, the Proof of Work mechanism is not the most effective mechanism and it also uses up a lot of electricity capacity to operate. A new mechanism has emerged to improve the disadvantages of Proof of Work. Enter Proof of Stake.

In layman’s terms, PoS works by requiring validators to stake assets (i.e., lock their assets in the network) to participate in the transaction validation process. The more assets that the validator stakes, the more often that the validator is chosen to write new transactions to the ledger. Since validators stake their assets, the network can assure that the incentives of the validators are aligned with the network’s goals and they will not perform intentional malicious behaviors such as creating invalid transactions or censoring transactions. Even if the validators do perform malicious actions, the network also has a punishment mechanism to keep validators in check, which is slashing. Slashing removes and destroys a portion of a validator’s delegated stake if they perform malicious actions. When a validator is slashed, all delegators who have delegated their assets to that validator lose a portion of their staked assets.

In reality, validators usually do not use their own assets to stake, they use delegated stake from other users instead. This is called delegated staking. In this process, any SOL token holder can assign some or all of their tokens to a particular validator to help increase those validators’ chances of participating in the validation process. In return, tokens holders, i.e., delegators, will receive a shared reward from the validators. Delegating tokens to a validator does not give the validator ownership or control over the assets. By staking tokens with a validator or validators, the delegators show a degree of trust in the validator since the validator may perform malicious actions and affect the delegated assets.

# How to earn rewards from staking on Solana?

The first way to earn staking rewards is obviously to become a validator. However, becoming validators requires a lot of resources and infrastructure so most people choose to delegate their assets to a validator.

To stake SOL tokens, delegators must use a wallet that supports staking (e.g., Solflare). SOL tokens in the delegator’s wallet must first be moved into a *stake account*. Delegators can create various stake accounts and deposit as much or as little SOL into each stake account as they want. Each new stake account has a unique address, and a single wallet can manage many different stake accounts. To earn staking rewards, the tokens in a stake account must be delegated to a validator. A single stake account can only be delegated to a single validator at any time, so delegators need to split their tokens among multiple stake accounts if they want to stake to different validators at the same time.

# Types of rewards on Solana

So what kinds of rewards that validators and delegators receive? In general, there are two sources of rewards on Solana: transaction fees and block rewards. The transaction fee is the fee paid by network users to include their transactions on the blockchain. Block rewards are new SOL minted every epoch (epoch is a period of time, typically 2–3 days on Solana).

The transaction fees are paid by network users to the validator that wrote the block. Delegators will receive block rewards and this type of reward is called *staking reward*. A portion of staking rewards is given to validators and this portion is called commission. The more staked assets that the validator can get, the more rewards that the validator can receive. Thus, many validators give a very competitive commission rate to attract delegators to give assets to them. Apart from commission, validators also receive transaction fees from all transactions that are written in the validated block.

Another type of reward is *voting reward*. Voting rewards are given to validators who do not write new blocks but only participate in validating the newly created block. Voting rewards comes from block rewards, which means this reward is minted every epoch.

# Where to find staking reward data on Solana?

A very good source that you can use to get staking reward metrics of Solana is [DanteHQ](https://www.dantehq.com/), a fundamental crypto data platform. DanteHQ provides data on three types of rewards: staking, voting, and fee. Apart from staking reward metrics, you can also see many other metrics such as DAU, transaction counts, etc. of each crypto project on DanteHQ. Below is the staking reward chart of Solana on DanteHQ.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**:

Understanding the two terms of APR  
 and APY  
 becomes even more important in DeFi today, as nearly all protocols with yield farming fields display these numbers. Knowing them well is not only for understanding and executing different strategies and calculating real profits.

&#x200B;

# General Conclusion

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

>Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

>What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.",0,2021-12-10 00:36:39,17
SOL,Binance,Personal information security,I would just like to ask if a person can figure out personal info based on deposits to binance wallets.

But I do not see ""Convert"" on the far right hand side of my ""Fiat and Spot"" page. How do people usually get rid of the VTHO? I wanted to convert it to something like ADA / Cardano or SOL / Solana. Thanks. Oh, and one other question: How can I get locked into staking for 90 Days? Every time I try to get locked in for 90 Days it is ""Sold Out."" Is there a way to get a notification of when the 90 Days is open for staking?",3,2021-10-22 06:12:25,13
SOL,Binance,Binance lauchpad: does it worth?,"It is the second time that I participate in Binance lauchpad. I cannot complain much, since there is a large ROI (although a very small allocation), but still... a lot of things dont match, and I would like to share some thoughts with this community.

The main problem is that the token unlocking schedule is not evenly met to everyone, the unlocking time rules are not fully open or are not accomplished, and some folks are able to sell their tokens at very high prices much before my tokens even arrive at my wallet. Let´s see what happened in the Lazio token launch example.

\*\*Lazio token launch\*\*

\*Rules\*

According with Binance schedule, all BNB commitments ended on 21st October at 10:00 AM (UTC). All Lazio tokens were supposed to be unlocked at 11:00 AM (UTC) of the same day.

\*Problems\*

1. Something that is not said in the launchpad rules, but that experienced users know (I had forgotten) is that trading only opens one hour after unlocking time. The fact that trading opens one hour late is not a problem. It could be even a good thing if this time was clearly written in the schedule and it was used by Binance to guarantee that all buyers get their tokens before the trade opens. However, neither is true.
2. I only received my tokens at 12:21 PM, 21 minutes after the trading started, by this time the token price had already fallen from $100 to $21.

\*Does it worth?\*

Ok, I had only paid $1 for each token, so I got a 20x return in a couple of hours. However, my allocation size was only of $1.6, so I got only $35. Looks like free money, right? Not quite. My BNB commitment was equivalent to $1,500. I had to leave this money parked at my spot wallet for a week to have the subscription right. This makes a 2% return in a week. Looks a lot for traditional finance, but in this same week, BTC went up 10% and Ethereum and Solana went up 20%.

In addition, I had to wake up at 6:00 am (of my country time) to make the subscription and I was stuck at home for 3.3 hours before my tokens were unlocked. Arrive kind of late in my job, and 3 hours of my work definitely worth more than $35.

Lastly, despite the small profit, there is the feeling that the rules are not the same for everyone, that some insiders get their tokens early. That is the worst part of it, to feel that you take part of something unfair. So no, it did not worth for me.",3,2021-10-21 12:44:20,13

SOL,Binance,Binance Temporarily Suspends LUNA Withdrawals,"The best cryptocurrency exchange platform Binance and the trading of several cryptos including ecosystem cryptos like Ethereum, Solana and Quint due to network congestion and slowness, has paused LUNA and UST withdrawals. 
LUNA and UST withdrawals were suspended at 2:20 a.m. UTC on May 10 due to a large number of outstanding withdrawals. According to the exchange, withdrawals will resume once the network is solid and the volume of pending withdrawals has lessened.

As previously reported, Terra's algorithmic stablecoin, UST, saw a free decline after losing its peg. Terra (LUNA) is currently trading at $31.79, down 48.59 percent in the last 24 hours, while the UST stablecoin is currently trading at $0.914, 9 percent below $1.

SOL,Binance,The CryptoQuestion November Bulletin - Important news roundup and free crypto resources for your listening and viewing pleasure,"**About us: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

**Market Overview**

The crypto market continues its new bull run, which re-commenced in July, hitting a new high of $2.7 trillion. Both Bitcoin and Ether also reached all time highs in October. Binance Coin, Tether and Cardano make up the top five by market cap. The Fear and Greed index currently sits at ‘Greed’, which compares to last week’s ‘Extreme Greed’ and last month’s neutral.

**Trending**

**SEC Approves Bitcoin Futures ETF**

After years of false starts the crypto industry finally got its ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). The SEC approved the ProShare Bitcoin Strategy ETF. After two days on the NYSE ProShare’s ETF became the fastest fund ever to reach $1 billion in assets under management. Physically based bitcoin ETFs, where you invest directly in bitcoin, are still waiting approval, but it is a promising start.

**SEC Chairman claims U.S won’t ban crypto**

It came as a relief to the market when Gensler the Chairman of the SEC declared that the U.S would not ban crypto but would seek to better regulate it. Although the final decision would be up to Congress. That regulation is most likely to be focused on the stablecoin market to begin with.

**Walmart enters crypto**

Walmart shoppers can now buy bitcoin at 200 kiosks in its stores. The test is with Coinstar which offers bitcoin at more than 3,000 kiosks.

**Axie Infinity creator raises $152 million**

Axie Infinity is one of the most popular play-ro-earn games on the blockchain commanding a $38 billion valuation (fully diluted). An Investment in the creator rather than the tokens is a telling sign that the tokens do not represent good value. Avoid for now.

**Memecoin mania**

Shiba Inu, the memcoin named after another dog, saw its token rocket in value before falling back after a comment from Musk that he didn't own any. But that comment didn't stop its rise and it is now valued above Dogecoin at $38 billion. Of course that has reignited the search for the next Doge or Shiba, a search we won't be embarking on.

**Squid Games pump and dump**

A token inspired by the Netflix show Squid Games saw its price spiral upwards by 380,000% on its debut. That upwards momentum continued as the price hit $2,861. However the price came crashing down as the founders cashed out with a $12 million profit and left the ‘project’. That my friends is the danger of investing in memecoins and projects with no fundamentals.

**NFT mania**

Coinbase announced it was launching an NFT marketplace focusing initially on Ethereum based NFTs.

**The good and bad of Robinhood**

Robinhood’s announcement that it was launching a crypto wallet hit the share price of Coinbase particularly after they revealed they had already signed up 1 million people to the upcoming product. However Robinhood suffered its own set back a few days later when it reported its quarterly earnings. The main cause of concern was the fall off in crypto trading from $233 million in the previous quarter to $51 million in the current. The shares tanked.

**USDC finds itself under investigation**

One of the leading stable coins, number two behind Tether, was issued with a subpoena from the SEC back in July, only recently coming to light however. It was also disclosed that the investigation continues. USDC announced it was shifting its reserves to only cash and treasuries. It is expected that the SEC will oversee the stablecoin market in the short term, something which will no doubt send shivers up the spine of Tether.

**Tether’s house of cards**

Last month we reported that the SEC is investigating Tether. This month they were hit with a $42.5 million fine by the CFTC. It was also reported in a Bloomberg expose that billions of dollars of client money has been invested in risky crypto projects, something the team at Tether initially denied but was later confirmed by Celsius who benefited from an investment of $1 billion. This is a devastating revelation and is a sure sign that if there was ever a bank run investors would suffer massive losses.

**New York targets DeFi Lending**

Both Nexus and Celsius received cease and desist letters from the New York Attorney General. Nexus and Celsius are lending platforms targeting private investors.

**Finally...**

A new survey suggests 11.4% of adults around the world own crypto. Nigeria, Malaysia and Australia have the highest rate of adoption. Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Philippines, Mexico and the US make up the top 10.

 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.

 

**TLDR**:

Understanding the two terms of APR  
 and APY  
 becomes even more important in DeFi today, as nearly all protocols with yield farming fields display these numbers. Knowing them well is not only for understanding and executing different strategies and calculating real profits.",3,2021-09-16 04:16:05,5

I've been doing some research for cardano based defi platfrom, since i'm starting to lose trust in meld campaign, and yet with coincidence i stumbled across aada finance project's article released yesterday (08 October). Of course while doing comparison with claim to be leaders of decentralised lending platform on cardano 'Meld' i saw huge difference - made progress. Aada finance has their not perfect beta calculator, which is something at their quite late start and also, in their announcement they said that one of new hires is experienced haskell programmer (source: [https://medium.com/@aada.finance/team-expansion-and-aada-initial-staking-pool-offering-ispo-calculator-update-c85a8f28f542](https://medium.com/@aada.finance/team-expansion-and-aada-initial-staking-pool-offering-ispo-calculator-update-c85a8f28f542)).

SOL,Binance,What Is IBC: Inter Blockchain Communication?,"  We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile)

  
**TLDR**:So you learned what an IBC is and how important it is to the Cosmos ecosystem. This feature makes the cryptocurrencies built on Cosmos easier to interact with and more efficient to use capital. This protocol creates the infrastructure for tokens to communicate across various blockchain tech stack. 

# General Conclusion

If you are active in the Cosmos Network, one of the first terms you will come across is IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) and IBC is a very important feature of Cosmos Network. So what exactly is IBC and why is it important to the Cosmos Network?

# 3 Approaches To Improve Blockchain Scalability

With Ethereum as the standard, there are currently three main ways blockchain infrastructure seeks to improve the scalability & scale of smart contracts.

1. The first way is through the use of **Rollup technology**, which allows the wrapping of transactions taking place in L1 on the sidechain into a single aggregated block and recorded on the original L1 Blockchain. This allows off-chain transaction data to be available on layer 1 whenever needed to validate a state transition. This is the Layer 2 extension technology that Ethereum is using. Check this video as Lisa explains what Rollup technology is. You can imagine it like creating a school bus for transactions on Ethereum. Although they are not arbitrarily scalable, they are a good short & medium term way to relieve congestion pressure. Imagine a school bus sending 50 kids instead of 50 cars on the road!
2. The second path is to **build a brand new Layer 1 blockchain** to achieve higher throughput and scalability using other technologies. For example, in the case of Solana & Internet Computer to achieve higher throughput, they require each node to be extremely powerful. (Side note: this is the reason why Solana went offline for a while in Sept.) This means that transaction processing is no longer performed by the vast majority of ordinary users because to do so they will need to invest a large amount of money in computer hardware, which is suitable. with individuals or organisations that are technically savvy and have ample financial resources. This is of course a trade-off as it affects the decentralisation of the blockchain. In our analogy, that means bigger buses to transport people.
3. The third path is to **combine heterogeneous blockchains through “interaction protocols**”. They are like building a system of highways across the country, connecting a series of provinces in a Country making travel easy and fast. Prominent projects in the third group can be mentioned as Cosmos, Polkadot, Avalanche.",2,2021-10-28 07:52:37,3

The US version of Binance appears to only offer 2 transfer networks for USDT: The expensive ERC20 network at $25 per transfer, or the much cheaper BEP2 network at $.025 per transfer.  Obviously my preference would be to use BEP2, except Gate.io doesn't have that option on the receiving end.  Gate.io has BTC/OMNI, ETH/ERC20, TRON/TRC20, BSC/BEP-20, EOS, Heco and Solana.  

Is there another known way in which I can use the BEP2 network - perhaps transferring the USDT to a wallet or a secondary exchange, and then doing a second transfer from said wallet or exchange to Gate.io?

The market took a hit this week dropping by nearly 13%, 5% of that fall happening in the last 24 hours. However by the time you read this there will no doubt have been another notable market movement. And that is why our general rule is to focus on the micro not the macro. Focus on what you can control - or at least have some element of control over!

Our list saw every one of our selected cryptocurrencies apart from three in negative territory with most seeing at least 20% wiped off their market value. It was not a pretty site!

**The week’s winners were:**

Lunch Money +38%

Faceter +13%

DAPS +7%

**And the biggest losers:**

Rarible -35%

Bridge Mutual -33%

Hybrix -29%

Handshake - 27%

We didn’t add any tokens this week although we have at least one lined up for you next week due diligence depending.

We removed two projects this week, Alpaca and Polkerstarter. We believe Alpaca doesn't offer anything different to the many operators in this market. We are also nervous about the SEC and state regulators targeting this space. For the same reason we have removed Polkerstarter. It is only a matter of time before the SEC targets the launchpad model and Polkerstarter will be at the top of their list.

SOL,Binance,Crypto 101: What're APY & APR ??," 

We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile)

 

**TLDR**:

Understanding the two terms of APR  
 and APY  
 becomes even more important in DeFi today, as nearly all protocols with yield farming fields display these numbers. Knowing them well is not only for understanding and executing different strategies and calculating real profits.

General Conclusion

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

>Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

>What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.",4,2021-10-20 03:31:08,1

The last few weeks have seen us devoting a disproportionate amount of time researching undervalued and undiscovered micro caps. Last week we revealed seven micro caps with market values under $2m, you can read the article here. This week we have been hunting for gems with market caps under $1m. It’s been an eye opening experience to say the least. Whilst there are few gems in this micro cap space they are there and as we all know, if you get it right it can be very lucrative. That is what gives us inspiration!

So with that said let’s look at how our current list has performed.

There appeared to be a bout of profit taking this week with a handful of projects which have enjoyed strong price runs over the last few weeks taking a hit. Other than that the list held its ground with only one significant performer.

**The main winners were:**

Faceter +46%

Handshake +11%

**And the losers:**

Candela -65%

Rentible -36%

PlotX -28%

We added only one project to our list this week.

**Lunch Money (LMY) -** [**https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lunch-money**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lunch-money)

Lunch Money describes itself as a universal loyalty rewards program, created by Restaurant Private I Inc, a mystery shopper platform aimed at improving customer service through anonymous customer oversights and incentives. Restaurant customers and restaurant delivery service customers can simply earn Lunch Money (LMY) by providing real feedback on their service experience.

Lunch Money has been around now for a few years with the token price having fallen from a high of $0.26 to its current price of $0.003, that’s a 99% reduction. But the project is far from dead. The team have been quietly beavering away building a new platform and establishing partnerships. Amazingly it is one of the few crypto projects registered with the US’s Securities Exchange Commission.

This is the kind of project that could go viral very easily. Why wouldn’t you provide a restaurant review if you are being paid to do so? This project is all about getting traction. It is in exactly the right spot, the gig economy. With a fully diluted market cap of $500,000 this project is a long shot but could well end up being a gem hidden under a mound of pebbles. It has no real volume at the moment and can rightly be described as undiscovered. That can work both ways.

You can buy Lunch Money through Uniswap.

Lunch Money replaces last week’s addition of Libertas. We will tell you the full story of our fall out with the CEO at Libertas in Monday’s Moonshot Monday. This made us question their own credibility hence their banishment from our list.

**Market Overview**

September has been a pretty negative month with the overall market seeing its value decline by 7%. The fear and greed index slipped back into extreme fear and now sits at fear. However there are reasons to be positive. Firstly the Chairman of the Fed, Jerome Powell, told congress he did not intend to ban crypto currency, although he said stablecoins needed greater regulatory oversight. Secondly, the massive recent negativity surrounding China’s ban on crypto looks to have been overdone as usual. It is evident that the Chinese crypto enthusiast has no intention of letting the crypto revolution pass him by. It appears as though they have started trading through DEX’s as witnessed by the surge in trade on Dydx. Finally the Chair of the SEC said that he supported a bitcoin ETF, another positive step forward for the industry. So all in all a positive week.

**Trending**

**Regulators target DeFi**

The SEC is investigating Uniswap Labs, the organization behind the leading DEX Uniswap. It is early days yet but is a sign of things to come. That news was followed by the announcement that New Jersey had served a cease and desist order on Celsius, a leading yield farming platform which advertises, ‘earn 17% yield on your crypto’. Alabama and Texas are also looking at doing the same. Both Celsius and Uniswap rolled out the same statement that they are willing to work with regulators. Finally, Coinbase was told in no uncertain terms that if they continued with their plans to launch a lending platform the SEC would sue. Whilst Coinbase continued to deny that lending represented a regulated activity, they had no choice but to shelve or bin their proposals.

Check out our [Staking and Yield Farming Review](https://medium.com/the-capital/weekly-staking-and-yield-farming-review-23rd-september-2021-6904585050c4) which sets out our thinking on these regulatory actions and what strategy investors should follow.

**The UK’s Post Office enters crypto**

Yes you heard it right! The Post Office announced that its app can be used to connect to a decentralized exchange called Swarm Markets, from there vouchers can be purchased that are redeemable for crypto. British politicians were up in arms about the announcement. The fully diluted market cap of Swarm is a modest $70 million, could be worth a closer look assuming the unhappy politicians don’t get their way.

**That old chestnut - China**

The recent stumble in the crypto market was blamed on China’s now outright ban of crypto no doubt to protect it’s digital yuan which it is rolling out. This should be no surprise. China has been tough on crypto for some time, the only surprise is this didn't happen sooner. Crypto will do just fine without China.

**Binance again**

Every month there is never any shortage of negative stories to write about when it comes to Binance’s trials and tribulations. This month saw the announcement that both the IRS and the DOJ are investigating. It is reported that this is for market manipulation and insider trading. Binance also announced it was withdrawing from yet another market, Singapore. We do hope that investors who use Binance’s central wallet have started to move their crypto into their own wallet.

**Robinhood and PayPal**

Robinhood announced that they were rolling out a crypto wallet with transfer features allowing customers to store crypto and move in and out of their apps. The market considers Robinhood a serious threat to Coinbase’s business with this move. Meanwhile back in the grey and damp UK PayPal announced they were introducing crypto trading services through their PayPal accounts. Of course there is a limited selection of coins available including the Bitcoin fork Bitcoin Cash valued at a ridiculous $10 billion.

**Cardano introducing its own stablecoin**

September saw the launch of the much anticipated and long overdue smart contract functionality on the Cardano blockchain. Named the Djed, it is an algorithmic stablecoin as compared to one backed by fiat. Its new stable coin is expected to make transaction costs on the Cardano network cheaper and more predictable. Its announcement comes at a time when US regulators are considering regulating or banning stablecoins.

**Finally…**

There is talk that the SEC is investigating Tether, the leading stablecoin player. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone following the shenanigans at Tether over their total lack of transparency since inception. There have been multiple reports of investigations into breaching banking and security laws.

Staking and yield farming has been a major driver in the huge growth in the DeFi sector. Investors are being enticed by the massive APRs on offer. Totally new projects tempting investors with returns of 10,000+ % are able to attract a deluge of money from investors who don’t seem concerned with the high risks involved.

SOL,Binance,Unfairly liquidated position on SOL/USDT Perpetual market,"I have already complaint to binance support center but I haven't received any response yet (Case ID #70258608). My complaint is the following:

I had a position on the SOL/USDT Perpetual market that was liquidated at 04-18-21 00:43:59 AM (order number 1743415110). I understand the fact that my liquidation price was $19.73 and that the minimum price on the SOL/USDT Perpetual market at that exact time frame was $18.86, reason why my order was liquidated. However, by looking at the SOL/USDT spot market, its minimum price at that same time was exactly $21.10. This is a HUGE difference between the two markets, which is completely unacceptable considering that it is even more than 10%. On the contrary, by comparing with BTC and looking at the BTC/USDT Perpetual market at that same time, the minimum price of this pair was $50050 but in the spot market its minimum price was $50931. This is a difference of 1.7%, which is much more reasonable than the tremendous gap that Solana suffered within the two markets.

As an illustrative example to put this injustice in perspective, let me note that if the difference between SOL/USDT spot market price and SOL/USDT Perpetual market price was of 5% (which is also a really significative difference) instead of the unacceptable 10%, the minimum that the SOL/USDT Perpetual market price should had reached at that exact time in which my order was liquidated is $19,95. Therefore, under this realistic scenario my order should not have been liquidated at all.

SOL,Binance,Unfairly liquidated position on SOL/USDT Perpetual market,"I have already complaint to binance support center but I haven't received any response yet (Case ID #70258608). My complaint is the following:

I had a position on the SOL/USDT Perpetual market that was liquidated at 04-18-21 00:43:59 AM (order number 1743415110). I understand the fact that my liquidation price was $19.73 and that the minimum price on the SOL/USDT Perpetual market at that exact time frame was $18.86, reason why my order was liquidated. However, by looking at the SOL/USDT spot market, its minimum price at that same time was exactly $21.10. This is a HUGE difference between the two markets, which is completely unacceptable considering that it is even more than 10%. On the contrary, by comparing with BTC and looking at the BTC/USDT Perpetual market at that same time, the minimum price of this pair was $50050 but in the spot market its minimum price was $50931. This is a difference of 1.7%, which is much more reasonable than the tremendous gap that Solana suffered within the two markets.

As an illustrative example to put this injustice in perspective, let me note that if the difference between SOL/USDT spot market price and SOL/USDT Perpetual market price was of 5% (which is also a really significative difference) instead of the unacceptable 10%, the minimum that the SOL/USDT Perpetual market price should had reached at that exact time in which my order was liquidated is $19,95. Therefore, under this realistic scenario my order should not have been liquidated at all. Moreover, I'm really raged by the fact that after this instantaneous singularity between the two markets at the minimum, for the following 5 hours the price of the SOL/USDT pair increased almost monotonically to reach a maximum at 05:39:00 AM. It’s frustrating to see that for this maximum the price on the Perpetual market was $28.58 and in the spot market the price was $28.64, which is a difference of merely 0.2%... that is 50 times lower that in the previous minimum!

SOL,Binance,Binance Chain burns $742 million worth of BNB in 19th quarterly burn,"In Q1 2022, the Binance Chain, one of the world's most extensively utilized blockchains, burned 1,839,786.261 BNB, the Blockchain's native cryptocurrency, valued around $742 million. This is the 19th installment in Binance Chain's quarterly token burn program, which started in the third quarter of 2017. 

Since the debut of the Binance Chain and its native token, BNB, in 2017, the team has pledged to burn a total of 100 million BNB, or half of the total supply, to remove them from circulation. The Auto-Burn formula was used to automatically calculate the number of tokens removed for this quarter.

Binance launched and implemented its first-ever auto-burn program, the BEP-95, in the fourth quarter of 2021, which calculates the number of BNB tokens to be burned using a formula based on the total number of blocks produced on the Binance Chain and BNB's average dollar-denominated price during the quarter.

When cryptocurrency tokens or coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum or Nature Vault are purposefully and permanently removed from circulation, they are referred to as ""burned."" The development team behind a cryptocurrency asset is usually in charge of token burning. It can be done in a number of methods, the most frequent of which is to send the coins to a so-called ""eater address,"" which has its current balance publicly viewable on the blockchain but no access to its contents. 

Burning may entail the project's developers purchasing tokens from the market or burning a portion of the supply currently accessible to them. Burning can be done with different goals in mind, but most often it is used for deflationary purposes: 

the decrease in the circulating supply tends to drive an asset’s price upward, incentivizing traders and investors to get involved. Another important use case for token burning is to maintain the price peg of stablecoins (cryptocurrencies whose value corresponds to another asset, like the U.S. dollar).",93,2022-04-19 19:28:44,40

SOL,Binance,BNB Chain offers another lifeline to Terra ecosystem projects,"Binance will welcome migration and offer support to Terra ecosystem (LUNA) projects following the breakup this month of the decentralized finance platform (DeFi) and its algorithmic stablecoin.

It was a matter of hours before it became clear that after Terra's massive collapse, large amounts of funds withdrawn from Terra were moved to BNB, more precisely to Stader, the Minosis Token project or various decentralized protocoins such as PancakeSwap for staking.

Well the BNB blockchain (BNB) has committed to provide investment and support to projects that are considering migrating from the Terra ecosystem following the biggest black swan event to hit the cryptocurrency space in recent years.

Stader Labs will become one of the first projects in the Terra ecosystem to begin integrating into the BNB blockchain. The company builds liquid betting solutions on four blockchains, namely Solana (SOL), Near (NEAR), Fantom (FTM) and Hedera (HBAR), and is poised to offer BNB liquid betting through a recently announced partnership.

Users will be able to make BNB stakes on Stader and receive returns through the platform, while the company will also issue a staking derivative representing BNB's holdings as stakes, which users can use on DeFi protocols.

Binance is not the only cryptocurrency company offering support to beleaguered projects within the Terra ecosystem. Telos has also announced its support for Terra ecosystem developers and projects this week and will work to accelerate migrations of decentralized applications, or DApps, that were operating in the Terra ecosystem - including investments, marketing support and technical assistance.",34,2022-05-20 18:57:34,38

I had few questions regarding your DCA strategy using Binance auto invest.

1. In terms of fees will it cost me more to auto invest daily vs weekly for example?
2. In general, is it more logical to DCA weekly? I'm trying daily right now but small amounts like 2 or 3$ on each coin I'm DCAing.
3. Which coins are you auto investing?   


As for myself, I'm trying to DCA on those coins :   
BTC: 15%  
ETH: 15%  
BNB: 15%  
MATIC: 15%  
SOL: 10%

SOL,Binance,It appears that many of you are not aware that your deposit may be delayed,"I posted about Binance not crediting my deposit assuming everyone knew that this happens from time to time.

Many of you seemed to not know what I was talking about. Some of you even tried to explain how it worked.

So I wanted to set the record straight so you are all aware and do not end up believing that as long as you do everything right, your deposit will be credited on Binance in a timely fashion.

It's entirely possible to do everything right and still Binance will not credit you. You have to submit a request for them to manually look for it. They say it will take 3 days and another 5-7 days for them to transfer the funds.

They won't give you a straight answer as to why this is happening. Here are some quotes from customer service.

*""normally the recovery is a bit complicated so it can not be rushed since we will attempt to recover your funds.""*

Recover? Who the hell lost them to begin with? The blockchain says the coin deposit received all necessary confirmations. The deposit should be seen in my account. Anyway,  I asked them if there was anything they could do to speed up the process. They replied:

*""we are sorry but its like your funds are lost so it will take sometime for binance to find it""*

*""The team has already been informed about your application but please kindly wait as it can take still some days.""*

*""currenltly your application is being review by the audit team. usually it will take up to 3 days for the to approve and credit the asset into your account.""*

&#x200B;

I asked them why this happened if I did nothing wrong. They replied:

*"" usually it may take some time upon the transaction to be credited due to high volume of authentication need to be confirmed by the system. and it may be also due to congested network. but we checked the address is correct and we will process the funds into your account as soon as possible.""*

So I asked if I should deposit the remaining SOL into another exchange since they are so backed up. They replied:

*"" you can deposit into binance but some times there are delayed due to high volume of transaction being authenticated by the system. your coins are not lost. it just been delayed due to network issue*

&#x200B;

Really? Because someone literally told me it's like my ""funds are lost.""

But fine, since there is a delay, and I still haven't received SOL I sent yesterday, then it's reasonable to assume that I wouldn't receive any sent right now, right? Why would I get the deposit sent right now before the deposit sent yesterday? They replied:

*""Yesterday high volume of SOL deposit via SOL network come to Binance, lead to a congestion. Now it is fine.""*

If it's fine now then where the hell is my deposit from yesterday? How does congestion lead to deposit being lost? And isn't SOL supposed to be superfast and shit? Isn't that it's thing? But I digress.

Moral of the story is do not assume you will get your deposit just because you did everything right. It sucks to see your planned investment keep going up while Binance holds your funds for god knows what reason.",26,2021-11-07 06:17:10,45

SOL,Binance,"Binance integrates Elrond Tokens, adds UTK UTRUST as the first ESDT on the platform","According to reports, Binance, the world's largest digital asset exchange and the trading platform of the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum and $Quint, has completed the integration of the Elrond Standard Digital Token (ESDT) standard and launched the UTK UTRUST to the digital platform as the first ESDT token. 

The digital exchange platform will now be able to list ESDT tokens for trading as a result of this new development. Elrond tokens are defined by the Elrond Standard Digital Token (ESDT), which is the industry standard. The commencement of the new relationship will be marked by the introduction of Utrust's UTK coins on Binance.

Binance has covered almost every aspect of DeFi finance and liquidity management. The platform has recently began to grow, and DeFi and TradFi entrepreneurs are being aggressively incorporated. As part of its objective to open up new areas in DeFi, the exchange executed an integration contract with Elrond to distribute the ESDT tokens. 

The first token to take advantage of this opportunity is Utrust, an Elrond-based payment processor. The web3 startup, which began as an Ethereum ERC20 coin, has only lately migrated to the Elrond network. The move was prompted by high gas fees and slow blockchain transactions. After becoming an ESDT token, Utrust's UTK can now be deposited and withdrawn directly on Elrond.

The key benefit of this integration is that it reduces transaction costs and speeds up UTK transactions. Given 9f Elrond’s advanced technology and infrastructure, it will be a realistic target for UTK. The payments company has published the UTK 2.0 economies upgrade, which will improve the UTK tokens’ use.
This is intended to revolutionize the entire view of web3 payments and bring this industry to a wider variety of merchants due to the quickness and incentives. Elrond and Binance’s integration comes at a good time for UTK, and it’s expected to offer these visions a boost.
According to Elrond, Binance will help sell the blockchain’s native products to a wider audience. Elrond CEO Beniamin Mincu, noted that the startups on Elrond will have access to the largest marketplaces and deepest liquidity imaginable through Binance.
In a similar vein, Sanja Kon, CEO of Utrust, believes it will spur the development of their Merchant Yield product and play a vital part in the mainstreaming of web3 payments. Consequently, this integration will greatly improve the project’s scalability.",65,2022-04-21 16:10:58,28

ABNBC is the liquid staking yield bearing BNB derivatives token issued by ANKR, they stake your BNB for you in their PoS nodes while minting you ABNBC, so that you’d still have liquidity while earning staking rewards. In essence, ABNBC =  BNB + staking income wrapped into a token, damn good no ?

Still, farming in Pancakeswap means you’ll receive the rewards in CAKE, you’d probably want to convert that to BNB. Using our yield optimizer at [happyhippo.farm](https://happyhippo.farm),  where you can find an autocompounding vault for ABNBC-BNB, means you’ll get 110% APY for staking BNB and will receive rewards in BNB as well, not some meaningless reward token.

SOL,Binance,Binance usdt Future Fees questions,"Hi, i just recently started trying out the usd-t future  


it was listed on binance that there is 2 fees for future transaction, which is transaction fee (maker/taker) and funding fee  


i then tried out to open a short position on SOL while using isolated margin, risking 10 usdt per trade as a sl   


i open a position at 33.59 /sol and bought 12 SOL, and the liquidation price was 34.1577, i want to have a 1:1 RR so i caclulate the price difference  which is a .5677 price difference  


and then if i put my tp at 33.59 - .5677 which is at 33.0223, i only gain around $7   


so basically im risking $10 to get $7, am i missing something? i use 50x leverage if that have any impact on the fees?   


my fee calc  
$400 \* .0004 (maker fee) = $.16  
no funding fee.  


the fee should be $.16 and not $3?

SOL,Binance,From a Developer: Logistical Problems Using Crypto for day-to-day,"Crypto hindered by Anti Money Laundering (AML) policies: During a recent coin launch, r/CryptoCraversLLC ran into a roadblock that I think you guys will find interesting.

Background: We deal with a TON of people that have never used/owned crypto before. Think having to explain difference between bep2/bep20 a million times...)

Imagine a muffler shop has their own coin on the binance smartchain. Susie comes in because she has an exhaust rattle. The muffler shop in question is offering Susie a giant discount for paying for the fix with the new shiny token. Susie gets excited and wants to sign up! This is where the fun starts... A team member has Susie download Trust Wallet on her phone and explain the risks. But then she has to use her debit card to buy crypto through Moonpay and cant because she just divorced Roger and with AML last names matter. Long story short, Moonpay denies her or puts her in a holding pattern because AML is a thing even though this is a legit person trying to do a legit thing. Then Susie gets frustrated and decides not to press forward with the coin purchase/get involved with crypto. The whole AML process is discouraging because understanding how to navigate the space for an ordinary person is difficult enough, putting this kyc process in place complicates things even more. In situations like this, it feels like this process was put in place to slow down crypto growth.

Besides slower transaction time and volatility, this is a real logistical problem of trying to utilize crypto for day to day. We are of course working on solutions, but I wanted to peel back the onion and hear your thoughts. What would you recommend as a solution? I know it's necessary, but it's frustrating because for Susie to get that debit card she had to give a lot of info to the bank.

According to the senior executive, the relationship will be publicly announced in the second half of 2022. Forbes has verified the collaboration as Q2 begins.

Furthermore, according to Forbes, Gulf Energy Development plans to invest in BNB, which is also known as the Binance Coin. They will also invest in part of the shares of Binance, the US branch of the cryptocurrency exchanges.

 
According to Brian Shroder, the current CEO of the exchanges, the US is aiming for an IPO.

 
Gulf Energy filed an official statement with the Thai Stock Exchange on Monday, wherein the company stated:

 

""The company, Gulf Energy believes that this multi-level collaboration with Binance, the world leader in blockchain service platform, is in line with the company's goal of becoming the pioneer in the field infrastructure. Will also offer prospects for the firm to widen into other digital asset-based initiatives in the long term.""

 

Furthermore, it's worth noting that Binance received many warnings in 2021 from the Thai administration. Thai governments declared that the company had no authority to trade in the country without a license. On the alternative side, Thailand has outlawed the use of cryptocurrency for payments and the trade of Non Fungible Tokens and meme currencies. 


Furthermore, companies like deedy, and other digital transformation oriented projects are also working strategically at the moment to overcome similar hurdles which can result in a positive manner for the company.",3,2022-04-21 18:49:12,15

SOL,Binance,What you need to know about staking rewards,"There are many ways to invest in crypto. You can buy and hodl crypto, actively trade crypto, delegate your funds to an asset manager, or, if you are a passive investor, you can consider staking to earn rewards. In this post, I will explain how staking works, ways to stake, type of staking rewards, and introduce you to DanteHQ, a platform that provides staking data. Before getting started, it’s worth noting that staking can only be done on blockchains that use the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism (we will figure out what is PoS right next). That’s why in this post, I will use Solana network as the prime example of staking mechanism.

# Staking on Solana: Explained

You have probably heard of the Proof of Work consensus mechanism of Bitcoin. Turns out, the Proof of Work mechanism is not the most effective mechanism and it also uses up a lot of electricity capacity to operate. A new mechanism has emerged to improve the disadvantages of Proof of Work. Enter Proof of Stake.

In layman’s terms, PoS works by requiring validators to stake assets (i.e., lock their assets in the network) to participate in the transaction validation process. The more assets that the validator stakes, the more often that the validator is chosen to write new transactions to the ledger. Since validators stake their assets, the network can assure that the incentives of the validators are aligned with the network’s goals and they will not perform intentional malicious behaviors such as creating invalid transactions or censoring transactions. Even if the validators do perform malicious actions, the network also has a punishment mechanism to keep validators in check, which is slashing. Slashing removes and destroys a portion of a validator’s delegated stake if they perform malicious actions. When a validator is slashed, all delegators who have delegated their assets to that validator lose a portion of their staked assets.

In reality, validators usually do not use their own assets to stake, they use delegated stake from other users instead. This is called delegated staking. In this process, any SOL token holder can assign some or all of their tokens to a particular validator to help increase those validators’ chances of participating in the validation process. In return, tokens holders, i.e., delegators, will receive a shared reward from the validators. Delegating tokens to a validator does not give the validator ownership or control over the assets. By staking tokens with a validator or validators, the delegators show a degree of trust in the validator since the validator may perform malicious actions and affect the delegated assets.

# How to earn rewards from staking on Solana?

The first way to earn staking rewards is obviously to become a validator. However, becoming validators requires a lot of resources and infrastructure so most people choose to delegate their assets to a validator.

To stake SOL tokens, delegators must use a wallet that supports staking (e.g., Solflare). SOL tokens in the delegator’s wallet must first be moved into a *stake account*. Delegators can create various stake accounts and deposit as much or as little SOL into each stake account as they want. Each new stake account has a unique address, and a single wallet can manage many different stake accounts. To earn staking rewards, the tokens in a stake account must be delegated to a validator. A single stake account can only be delegated to a single validator at any time, so delegators need to split their tokens among multiple stake accounts if they want to stake to different validators at the same time.

# Types of rewards on Solana

So what kinds of rewards that validators and delegators receive? In general, there are two sources of rewards on Solana: transaction fees and block rewards. The transaction fee is the fee paid by network users to include their transactions on the blockchain. Block rewards are new SOL minted every epoch (epoch is a period of time, typically 2–3 days on Solana).

The transaction fees are paid by network users to the validator that wrote the block. Delegators will receive block rewards and this type of reward is called *staking reward*. A portion of staking rewards is given to validators and this portion is called commission. The more staked assets that the validator can get, the more rewards that the validator can receive. Thus, many validators give a very competitive commission rate to attract delegators to give assets to them. Apart from commission, validators also receive transaction fees from all transactions that are written in the validated block.

Another type of reward is *voting reward*. Voting rewards are given to validators who do not write new blocks but only participate in validating the newly created block. Voting rewards comes from block rewards, which means this reward is minted every epoch.

# Where to find staking reward data on Solana?

A very good source that you can use to get staking reward metrics of Solana is [DanteHQ](https://www.dantehq.com/), a fundamental crypto data platform. DanteHQ provides data on three types of rewards: staking, voting, and fee. Apart from staking reward metrics, you can also see many other metrics such as DAU, transaction counts, etc. of each crypto project on DanteHQ. Below is the staking reward chart of Solana on DanteHQ. You can see the live chart at: [https://www.dantehq.com/chain?utm\_source=reddit&utm\_medium=social\_media&utm\_campaign=blog\_staking\_rewards&utm\_id=blog\_staking\_rewards&utm\_term=blog\_staking\_rewards&utm\_content=blog\_staking\_rewards](https://www.dantehq.com/chain?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social_media&utm_campaign=blog_staking_rewards&utm_id=blog_staking_rewards&utm_term=blog_staking_rewards&utm_content=blog_staking_rewards)

SOL,BitcoinBeginners,Absolute beginner getting some mixed information. Any help appreciated ,"I’m completely new to bitcoin and crypto currencies. I’ve been trying to learn about it but so far I’ve picked up mixed information.

From what I gather, first I need a broker - Coinbase and Gemini seem to be the most recommended. Are then any real noticeable differences between the two? 

I then learned about Twilio Authy - which when the broker is used through it it adds another level of security?…only then I found out Authy is switching to mobile only, and Coinbase no longer supports it. 
Instead, Coinbase supports Duo and Google authentication. Do these both work the same as Authy does - you use Coinbase within Due/Google authentication? Anyone have any experience using them via iPhone? 

I then learned I can connect my bank account to (let’s say) Coinbase for cheaper fees…rather than use debit transactions?
I heard it can take days though for money to go into a Coinbase/Gemini account? 
Someone said they use another thing called Plaid to help with these transactions. Does anyone have any experience of Plaid in the uk? 

It’s my understanding that it’s then just a case of using, let’s say, Coinbase via Duo to purchase the crypto and it then automatically goes in to your app? I keep hearing about private keys…but from what I can gather these are codes from ‘wallets’ to send crypto to those ‘wallets’? And not key codes received as ‘receipts’ for crypto?

And then we get on to security… I’ve learned the difference between cold and hot wallets. 
Hot wallets can make interest, correct? But are more at risk from hackers/bankruptcy?
One YouTuber I watched recommended Blockfi during his ‘step by step guide’…I then looked up blockfi to find it went bankrupt in 22. 
I’ve heard others talk about Bluewallet. 
Isn’t Coinbase a hot wallet itself though? What’s the benefit of moving it from Coinbase (within duo) to Bluewallet?

I’ve also heard Coinbase offers cold wallets for their customers for free? How does this work if still online?

I’ve seen Trezor recommended as a cold wallet…but then seen there’s a few different models of the Trezor wallet…the older ones not supporting some coins like Solana. Is there any known reason for this? 
They’re also quite expensive for what looks like they’re effectively a usb stick. Are there any decent cheap cold wallets available in the uk that can be recommended? 

Investing…I’m not thinking about going crazy. At the moment I’m thinking very safe (about £1000), so maybe concerns about security measures aren’t even warranted? I do know I want to give any investment chance to grow though.
I’ve heard about an apparent halving upcoming. From what I can gather this will mean prices in bitcoin with go up? So I’ve heard it’s best to buy before this halving happens.
But then I’ve also heard YouTubers advise selling after it happens as a crash will follow? Wouldn’t it be best to buy after a crash? Or not sell as prices would likely go up again as apparently this happens every 4 years? 

I’ve learned ETFs are now onboard with bitcoin. Is it worth investing in an ETF? I know they carry expense ratio charges

Basically, I think whatever I invest in I’m planning to hold on to for awhile 

I’m completely new so may have gotten things confused but any help, or pointing to video tutorials that can talk me though making my first purchases as if I’m a child, would be appreciated ",5,2024-02-26 19:02:51,17

SOL,BitcoinBeginners,is this a simple and cheap strategy to anonymize bitcoin with KYC.,"*\*\*\*\*The title is a question. I don't know how to edit the title. Sorry\*\*\**  


Once you buy with KYC, the selling company and possibly the government, will know forever that you bought bitcoin, and if they are not anonymized, they can also know what your bitcoins are, and consequently monitor all your movements.

The main reason I find it interesting to do Coinjoin/whirlpool is to be able to unlink my identity from those particular coins, complicating surveillance a bit. This way, the government or the seller will know how much bitcoin you bought but not what you have done with it, which grants you some freedom. However, IMO whirpool and coinjoin have fairly high fees.

I would like to know the pros and cons of the following strategy to anonymize bitcoin. It suggests the use of Lightning network (LN), but as I do not understand very well the traceability of coins in this network I would like you to explain me the problems of this strategy:

The only prerequisite for this is to download two wallets on your mobile that are able to receive and send bitcoin onchain but also over LN, called wallet A and B. Two wallets that can do this are muun wallet and blue-wallet for example, although there are more.

1.- You buy bitcoin from your usual seller2.- You withdraw bitcoin to your mobile in a wallet (A) that supports both onchain and LN. (you pay the exchange withdrawal fee)3.- You send from wallet A to a wallet B that also accepts LN and you do it via LN (ultra-low fee)3.1.(Optional)- You bounce several times by lightning between wallets A and B at a very reduced cost (does this make sense?)4.- From wallet B, you withdraw onchain to your cold storage.5.- The end.

To what extent can someone trace the coins or can be sure that they still belong to the same person using this strategy? Thanks!",1,2022-04-17 19:17:43,76

SOL,BitcoinBeginners,Software vs hardware,"Hi guys I know this question may have been asked before but I can’t find the exact answer I’m looking for so here goes.

What exactly is the benefit of using a hardware wallet over installing an open source software wallet on your phone, putting btc on it, writing down your recovery phrase and then deleting the software wallet

So step by step:

1. Install an open source wallet on your phone (after doing your due diligence, there are a few recommendations like blue wallet)
2. Transfer your btc to the wallet
3. Write down on paper your recovery phrase
4. Delete the wallet from your phone. So you are no longer carrying direct access to your entire btc stash around with you wherever you go
5. Your btc is stored on the blockchain, just as it is stored on the blockchain with a hardware wallet
6. If you ever need your coins you install a good open source wallet again on your phone, or computer, or wherever, and viola you have access

What exactly is the advantage of using a hardware wallet over this specific scenario I outlined above?

Some say that value is subjective and as long as the price is above 0, then it means the coin has at least some value. 

However, price just means that there is at least 1 willing buyer and 1 willing seller who agree to transfer something at a given price. If I sell my neighbor a blade of grass for $1, that just means my neighbor is a sucker because grass is valueless.

SOL,BitcoinBeginners,Steganography to protect private key,"I never hear anyone bringing this up, and perhaps it's chieffly because isn't as good an idea as I instinctively assume it to be.

One problem in securing a seedphrase by writing it on paper / metal and hiding it in a safe place or a vault, is that if anyone finds it, you're SOL.

One solution for that is a passprhase, which, if you forget it or even the slightest part of it, you're SOL. Plus, if you go for enough enthropy, it can be complex enough to increase the chance of forgeting part of it. You can also store it physically, which adds to complexity of recovering your funds. It seems a bit of a loss that the fondamentals of blockchain technology (not subject to decay/destruction due to digital nature, ubiquity of access, decentralisation, etc.) aren't applied to the preservation of seedphrases.

I wonder why steganography isn't used as a solution for it. I don't really mean modern steganography (i.e hiding date in the least relevant bit of images or audio files), but the more oldschool approach.

If someone, instead of writing his seed phrase plain text, or encrypting it (thus tying oneself to hardware/software for recovery), were to write the number associated to each word of his phrase on the BIP39 list, wouldn't that string of number be meaningless to someone who find it?

As an added layer of security, couldn't one just substract or add a number of his choosing (one or two digits for simplicity) to each of those number corresponding to his BIP39 words, further obscuring things. He then would only have to remember that one or two digit ""master number"", and from it reconstruct his key easily.

Then what you store away is not only meaningless for anyone who might find it, but even with intel on what it might be (which they couldn't have), they would have to know how much to add or substract to every number in order to reconstitute your key. The benefit for the HODLER being that it's way easier to remember ""+53"" or ""-6"" than any decently complex passphrase.

Then, one could have that number sitting inconspicuously amidst random data, let's say in a large google sheet, or any sufficiently meaningless document to be hidden in plain sight. Or convert that modified number back to the corresponding words on the BIP39 list and integrate it whithin a story, or any long text document.

Then one would benefit from the infinite redundancy of digital files, as well as the decentralisation of internet which would allow recovery anytime from anywhere without any third parties.

To me it feels like it limits the risk of user mistake (just one very simple ""master number"" to remember); nullifies any chance of physical back up loss, destruction or theft; allows for trust-less recovery (you don't have to trust your close-ones or banker to keep your key or parts of it safely, or go through them to access it again), all while keeping away from the complexity and cost of multisig and the risk of passphrases.

But perhaps I'm just naive, and not up to date with the cunning of those who would want to get their hands on our private keys.

Please help me understand why that kind of strategy (hiding something meaningless looking and useless in that form in plain sight) wouldn't work or isn't advised.",3,2023-09-28 15:51:21,4

This is the password that ""rebuilds"" my wallet (in case I forget, or lose the simpler password that I generate myself). I think I understand this pretty good, maybe.

Ultimately, I want to put my BTC into cold storage, but I need to understand a few things. I cannot find specific answers to these questions and getting burned out watching the mostly terrible, how to videos on YT.

These questions are all interrelated, so, probably there is a way to answer the questions in a single, simple explanation that answers them all.

Questions: 

Is it possible to transfer my BTC to a new wallet using that 12 word password from Exodus? Like download a new wallet, put in the 12 words, and boom, there is my BTC in the new wallet.

When people say they are putting their BTC into ""Cold Storage"", is that the 12 word password? Or is there something else it stores?

I read people saying they memorize their 12 word (or more) password so they always have their BTC safe. So, if I memorize my 12 word password, am I able to open it into any new wallet I get? 

Can I cold storage my BTC in my head)? So, I have a software wallet that people can pay me in BTC, while All my BTC is stored in my head?

Ultimately, I would like to memorize my 12 word password and use my brain as the cold storage. Am I understanding the way this works, or am I way off?

SOL,BitcoinBeginners,Question about using cointracker to do my taxes,"I am currently using coinbase pro and Kucoin to buy and hold crypto.

In the year of 2021 I liquidated into cash but reinvested it back into some coins and I also did some swing trades where I converted to a stable coin and then went back in when that coin dipped again. So now I'm thinking I inadvertently complicated my taxes. With how crypto taxes work, I have no idea if I owe money or not for that year.

In order for me to make the process simple I was told to use cointracker and create an API with kucoin and coinbase pro.

Cointracker is now asking me for a passphrase, an API key and an API Secret.

I can figure out how to create all these in Kucoin and Coinbase pro, but I'm wondering if it's safe and what the pros and cons are in giving them this information?

Also, does anyone know if there is an easier way to report my crypto taxes then doing it this way?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!",6,2022-03-29 15:45:02,22
SOL,BitcoinBeginners,Transferring wallet.dat file and getting an Open wallet failed error,"Hey everyone!

Was on my old PC from 16-17 and saw that I still had my Bitcoin folder on the hard drive with the wallet.dat file.

I've redownloaded Bitcoin Core onto my PC and let it fully sync, I have then closed the client and deleted the wallet.dat file and replaced it with my wallet.dat file from 16-17.

When I re-open Bitcoin core and go to File/Open Wallet I notice it's called 'itcoin'? When I click to open it prompts me with an error:

Wallet file verification failed. Failed to load database path 'E:\\itcoin'. Path does not exist.

SOL,BitcoinBeginners,A bunch of nagging questions,"Sorry for all the questions at once, but I figure it's better than spamming the sub.
- I want to automate DCA (set it & forget it) as much as possible safely. What's the best method to do it in Coinbase Pro?
- How about APIs for DCA? They seem unsafe to me with sensitive info flying back and forth.  Do you recommend them or should I avoid? 
- It would be easier for Coinbase Pro to pull funds from my account instead of having to upload fiat first then buy. Am I SOL there?
- Should I move the coin immediately after I buy it?  It's going to be very small DCA for now.  What are some rules-of-thumb people use?
- Do others open a separate bank account just for Coinbase pro for safety?  Can it be a savings account?  Paypal seems safer, but I bet the fees are really high, right?
If there are others that have a proven setup for DCAing with Coinbase Pro, I'd love to hear it.
- Regarding wallets, the main benefit of hardware wallets over mobile/smart-phone wallets is hacking them is virtually impossible, and it's easier in theory to hack a mobile wallet since they need to store the seeds somewhere?  
- If Bluewallet disappears one day (for instance), as long as I have my seed words I can create a new wallet with any service using the same seeds, right?  If so, could you open the same wallet with 2 providers?",1,2021-12-13 17:46:39,8

I read and reread the instructions for the raspiblitz lightning node, started downloading the blockchain and started putting it all together. After not much time I got stuck when whatever I was supposed to copy and paste wasn't giving me the results that were listed in the instructions. 

Soon after that my wife had our first baby, my world turned upside down and everything bitcoin related got pushed to the back burner. Now that our little guy is getting older I'm finding myself with a little more free time and I'd like to start trying to run a node again. 

The problem is that I, evidently, do not have the proper skills to build a node from scratch. Even if I'm following the seemingly very simple instructions. Since I have all the parts I need I'm not really interested in giving up and buying a Casa node.

Now I saw the price of bitcoin and decided I should probably try to see if I still had what I got forever ago. So I got on my bitcore and started letting it sync and finally once it got to the date of the transaction my bitcoin showed up! So I immediately sent it to myself back on coinbase. 

Bottom line the transaction is still pending and unconfirmed after 17 hours. I did the recommended fee which was .00003840, I'm not sure if I'm just paranoid or am I SOL.

SOL,CryptoMoon,Solana Highroller,"Yeah, so this is not a new cryptocurrency or another coin, but i just wanted to share a new crypto casino I found the other day, which is pretty cool because I have never seen a casino like this. Its just a telegram bot that operates on the Solana network, pretty much instant deposit and withdrawals, and has tons of gamemodes.

They have a new gamemode called Diddy Party, where the objective is to hide the baby oil from P. Diddy lmao. Choose difficulty from easy to hard where multiplier differ from 2x to 10x.

Would recommend playing on mobile instead of PC becuase it just looks nice asf.  
Just search HighRollerEUBot on Telegram or HRSolana on X to find it.

SOL,CryptoMoon,$BTC | Top 5 reasons to buy Bitcoins on Solana + 8M BTC Giveaway,"Hey everyone!

Are you tired of just owning a fraction of a Bitcoin and feeling left out of the whale club? Well, do I have some news for you. Bitcoin on Solana ($BTC) lets you own 1 million bitcoins for just under $11 USD.

Sure, we're under a $10k market cap, but hear me out... here are some solid reasons to buy in:

1. **Clout and prestige:** the BTC balance in your Solana wallet is almost indistinguishable from the real thing. Use this to gain entry into the most exclusive events, test drive luxury cars and hang with the upper echelon of society.
2. **Practice Your Diamond Hands:** Train yourself to hold during market crashes without any real financial pain — it's like Bitcoin on training wheels!
3. **The Culture:** the $BTC community on Telegram consists of the most cultured members from communities such as $HEGE, $CTHULHU, $NANCYCOIN & $BOMBO. They are in it for the unlimited LARPing potential (it's like stepping back to 2009).
4. **Literally Unruggable:** I know this gets thrown around a lot, but it's now over 19 days since $BTC graduated the pump fun trenches and launched on Raydium. If it was a rug, it would have happened by now. The dev holds less than 3% of supply, which is barely enough to make a dent.
5. **More satisfying than building the LEGO® Harry Potter set:** building a blockchain is infinitely more satisfying (and affordable than playing with those those plastic blocks.

SOL,CryptoMoon, Why $HEGE Might Just Be the Next Solana Gem You’ve Been Waiting For ,"Hey Reddit, I want to share something that I’ve been getting into lately $HEGE. This memecoin on Solana is quickly becoming one of the hottest projects around, and I think it’s worth paying attention to.



First off, the growth of $HEGE has been absolutely wild. From a $6M market cap to $30M in just two weeks, and it’s already bouncing back strong after a dip. Right now, it’s sitting at $8M, and I believe this coin still has so much room to grow. Think about it a coin with real growth potential in a solid community that’s just getting started.



But it’s not just about the numbers. The community around $HEGE is amazing. The vibe here is unlike anything I’ve seen before. It’s full of people who are genuinely excited to be part of something big. There are regular meme contests, giveaways, and even tokens being shared with the most active members. It feels more like a movement than just a coin.



The team behind $HEGE is another reason I’m all in. They’re super active on Telegram and Twitter, constantly engaging with the community and keeping things transparent. No weird stuff going on here just a dedicated group working to make $HEGE a success.



And let’s not forget about the marketing. $HEGE has already gained over 3,400 new Twitter followers in just two weeks, and that’s only the beginning. With major exchange listings on the horizon and a growing presence on Reddit, TikTok, and other platforms, the momentum is real.



If you’re looking for the next big thing on Solana, $HEGE should be on your radar. It’s still early, and the future is looking bright. The community is solid, the growth is happening, and I think this is one coin that could go places.",2,2024-11-15 07:38:12,0

SOL,CryptoMoon,12 Reasons Why You Should Hold POWSCHE on Solana,"[JOIN POWSCHE'S TELEGRAM TODAY](https://preview.redd.it/dhd3ozlzpp7d1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee52e227b671fe4e49a38204d8c1718232bd3c58)

Currently, Solana memecoins are a minefield of coin after coin, so many cats and dogs, with or without hats popping up every single day.

POWSCHE, it’s just under 3 months old, so it’s stood the test of time in this fast-paced memecoin world we live in.  

**12 Reasons why you should hold POWSCHE** (In no particular order)

1. Tesla and Lambo burns - These are planned at various milestones and they are going to be streamed live on Kick for the world to see, I would imagine this is going to generate millions of views bringing a lot of new investors into the space. 
2. Porsche lottery giveaway - By just buying POWSCHE and holding you are in with a chance to win  actual Porsche's at various milestones, this includes an actual Porshc 911 GT3RS, which is a fantastic way to give back to the holders. 
3. Tesla giveaway to a single mother - This is a fantastic way to give back to the community in-real life. 
4. The holders - they have so much conviction that they didn’t sell when some of them had near to $3.5 Million in their wallets. I can understand why they have so much conviction, which I am going to go into so you can have the full picture. 
5. POWSCHE podcast - The podcast is informative and it gives you a sense of what POWSCH and the community want to achieve, it’s available on Spotify and YouTube.
6. Twitter Spaces - Launched recently, the plan is for the Dev (Mr Powsche) to go live on Twitter Spaces, he’s there to chat about up-and-coming plans and field any questions from the community, he always available in the Telegram group, sometimes around the clock!
7. POWSCHE referral programme - POWSCHE has developed a referral programme to earn POWSCHE from everyone you refer with your referrer link.  This way of thinking is innovative and exactly what this memecoin space needs. 
8. Leadership team - the POWSCHE team has set up specific areas and teams that concentrate on marketing, strategy, sales etc, this is unheard off in this space, they are running POWSCHE like a business.
9. Industry Experts - POWSCHE has industry-leading experts on the team, whether it’s in cryptocurrency, investing, or marketing, the team is top tier, which really makes you confident that the right team is in place and will guarantee the success of this coin.
10. Community Engagement - I’ve not seen a community like this, well maybe the early GME days when there was a positive outlook and vibe, this is exactly what you’re getting here, join the Telegram and see for yourself.  
11. Strong Roadmap -  With clear goals and innovative plans, POWSCHE is always thinking ahead, it’s good to see an actual roadmap for once, there are too many coins not willing to put the effort into this. 
12. Luxury Branding - Just like Porsche, owning POWSCHE is a statement of style and class, it’s an aspirational brand, highly recognisable, and makes you proud to be part of the POWSCHE movement.

For me it’s clear, POWSCHE stands out more than any other memecoin out there, it’s category-defining, first to the market and the team is full of experts with a clear vision and strategy.  It’s not a pump and dump, I can guarantee that.

DYOR - Don’t just take my word for it, join the community, check the vibe and only when you’re comfortable, then invest a couple (or more) Solana.  Then you just need to hold, sit back and relax.

SOL,CryptoMoon,"Most ambitious web3 project i have witnessed on Solana, Murad predicted serious memecoins, PengyOS will melt faces","**my thesis** is that this will do crazy numbers.

If you are a fan of murad, he has this prediction about **serious memecoins** on the rise for 2025. And I think this Project has exactly what it takes, to do very well in the upcoming **supercycle** for **memecoins**.

**PengyOS** offers a **web3 memecoin** that does things differently, instead of focussing on **memes** they have build an **entire platform** around it. Which is very **smooth & appealing**, besides that also being **very usefull**.

**POS CA - B8vV6An7xFF3bARB1cmU7TMfKNjjes2WvY7jWqiRc6K6**

**Solana Mobile** for example has made a big name for themselves, and for them to **collaborate** with them says a lot about their **integrity** & that they **believe** in their **vision** of being the next big thing.

Especially their **dApp folder** catches the eye, it reminds me of a folder on an **iPhone**. It has many subcategories, including other **succesfull memecoins**, which I think is amazing to see them not having a **PVP** mindset

There is so much possibilities with this, especially their **webOS** gives me that **nostalgic** feeling of the early 2000 desktops, which I really love being kid from the 90s.

https://preview.redd.it/2jbgjjz5mrwd1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=95bafd089f40da00be131d8abb22a6d0c59ae387

Their **meme narrative** is also the mascot of the Project, called **Pengy.** They do such a amazing job delivering the message & also using this as a **meme side** which they also integrated as seperate **dApps**

The amount of **dedication & willpower** that goes into this is **astonishing,** they just keep adding more **features & dApps.**

Their **MCAP** does not resemble their current **Project efforts**, but I sincerely believe that it will not stay this **undervalued** for long. They have been creating **higher lows**, and seem to hold very well considering their trading volume.

https://preview.redd.it/fgut9087mrwd1.jpg?width=1283&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d1cbccfc39c44e466f8d96ab8fd83c7f61b81d9

It was also pitched **live in Berlin** in front of a crowd & **hackathon judges**, which just further proves my point. These guys are **serious** about what they **build**, and also introduce it in a way that their use case on **Solana** makes sense.

So overall **very strong narrative & project** that builds and shows how much Solana is actually missing, I would even title this the best Project that I have ever seen build on Solana.

Check them out, their X is full of **high quality content**,and their website & app are very promising",6,2024-10-24 20:37:32,2
SOL,CryptoMoon,Why you should check out $SASSY the Sasquatch on Solana,"**$SASSY** the Sasquatch is a CTO on Solana that has been going for about 3 months now and the team keeps building and the community keeps growing. It is now at $140k market cap and I believe it is severely undervalued. This is why I think you should at the very least check it out as a play for the bull run:

* For context **$SASSY** is a fan token derived from a character from the Big Lez Show on Youtube, that show has over 300 million views and over 2 million subscribers... think about the number of fans that could convert to $SASSY, even 3% (current global crypto ownership) would be over 60,000 holders...
* Their Instagram account hit **1.5 million views** on one of their videos, reached over **1 million accounts in the last 30 days** and their latest video released a few days ago is at **85k views**. This is going to create a fly wheel and as the crypto market heats up and traditional media starts bull posting BTC ATHs, $SASSY will be one of the first meme coins they know. Let that sink in with the first point. There are very few meme coins that have this social presence and any that do are well into the multi-millions, think about Ponke.
* Their TikTok has almost 10k followers and they have a TikTok shop now set-up that will contribute passive income to the project.
* They are about to do a collaboration with $POPDOG, which will be released soon and give massive exposure to the project, many other collabs are in the works. $SASSY will also be on the $UTOOB platform which is about to be released and will lead to thousands of viewers and potential buyers.
* Their team is on spaces 24/7 and always grinding getting the word out, forging great partnerships with other projects and KOLs.
* They just implemented a custom AI meme bot in their TG, its a lot of fun and provides infinite content, if nothing else jump in and have a play around with it, use /image following by any prompt you can think of.
* Their roadmap includes bringing the creator of the show into the project, there is a marketing wallet with supply reserved for this. If this was achieved this would send this project to insane heights.

I truly believe this meme has everything going for it, existing cult through Big Lez Show, based team and community and now great traction through their socials.

SOL,CryptoMoon,Solana Memecoins history and current state; The ones that had the strength to overcome the hardships and prevail.,"&#x200B;

If you've been in this space long enough, you probably remember all the projects that claimed to be the next big thing. I'm talking about $Chef, $BLBY, $YeWifHat, $Seat, $Powsche, $RedPill, and so on. The only two projects I'm not throwing any shade at are $Powsche and $Seat, as their communities really tried to fight and keep up with their hard work (and who knows, one day they may be back). Other projects (99% of them) fall into the worst category of them all: Rug Pulls.

&#x200B;

A lot of meme coin projects didn't have the quality and the strength to fight off certain trends in the market. We had a few major dips in the market, then the Andrew Tate frenzy, the WIFHAT phase, the Donald Trump shooting, and so on; Phases where a lot of people were abandoning their projects and were brainlessly chasing pumps (which led them to losing their money every single time).

&#x200B;

**In the sea of projects two of them prevailed, and stood tall and strong after every trend fight-off - I'm talking about $HEGE and $KENDU.** The reason for that is simple - their communities didn’t allow them to fall. We all know that community is the most important factor of a meme coin project. **Both of these communities were too strong and united; they held with conviction and fought off the jeets every single time.**

&#x200B;

Disclosure-wise, my one and only conviction play is $HEGE. That doesn’t mean I’m here to bash on Kendu, even though bashing is something that some of their certain individuals always do to us and our community. I acknowledge and respect their ""Working for our bags"" mentality, and they do a fantastic job of actively raiding, shilling, and spreading the word about their project. The only reason I'm not a holder is because, with all due respect to them, I see more potential in Hege.

&#x200B;

As of this writing, Hege has a market cap of $6.5 million and as for Kendu, it is $100 million. That means that in order to double my money, if I go with Hege, I need a $13 million market cap. With Kendu, I would need $200 million. Another example would be putting $100 into both projects and waiting for a $200 million market cap. An investment in Kendu would then be worth $200, while an investment in Hege would be worth $3,000. The logic is very clear: Hege has MUCH more room to grow. Everything I said was with all due respect to Kendu community, and I wish nothing but the best for them. We all can eat. As for us and our community:

# 

# $HEGE is considered to be the king of Reddit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Recently, more focus has been put on real-life marketing stunts, as well as growing our presence on other social media platforms (X, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok). The most recent marketing stunt was an airplane flying above Los Angeles with our banner. The stunt yielded great results, as many people joined our Telegram group directly from it.

&#x200B;

[Plane with $HEGE banner flying above the Hollywood.](https://preview.redd.it/fyrlg725d2id1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=643fd7bab4cfab74826d32d919b5627213f0d0db)

&#x200B;

**Our team member fully customized a $HEGE-RV and is doing a tour with it.** Over the next few months, our $HEGE-RV will be making its way around the US and Canada. The RV will visit many famous landmarks and sites of interest (i.e., Las Vegas Strip, Santa Monica Pier, Yosemite National Park, etc.).

&#x200B;

[$HEGE-RV visiting the South of the Border.](https://reddit.com/link/1eppdh5/video/x3f1e1s5d2id1/player)

&#x200B;

Hege's real-life-sized mascot is in the works, and we will soon have some insane content featuring it (for example: Hege's mascot interviewing people on the street). Besides that, there are many more real-life marketing stunts that are being worked on behind the scenes, but I can't talk about it currently. We want it to be a surprise!

&#x200B;

On the technical side of things, we like to say that our boy $HEGE is Rug-Proof. LP tokens are burned; freeze and mint authority are revoked. You can find all of the safety information in the following picture:

Being a part of the $HEGE community brings you many opportunities to earn while working for your bags. We constantly host competitions and contests where our members' hard work and creativity pay off big time! We often host Reddit competitions, meme contests, social media giveaways, and so on. We even had a ""$1,000 Riddle"" giveaway where the member with the best detective skills won big! Currently, we're hosting a sticker contest (until August 19th) that has a $2,000 prize pool! Get creative and you're in it for a chunky win!

I'll conclude this post with the following statement: This project has everything it takes to reach a billion-dollar market cap. Once it gains even a little bit of exposure, an insane takeoff is imminent. Watching it from the sidelines will not be a pleasant experience, knowing you could have hopped on the rocket.

SOL,CryptoMoon,$PO on Solana - A token with a very promising community and actual utility. ,"$PO - a new meme coin ready to redefine the meme coin space.

This token is a hidden gem that will get you out of the trenches. Already with a thriving community, and a unique narrative, it may well have the potential to 100x.  
   
$PO's Devs has launched an integrated c\*sino game into the telegram, allowing a very unique community to form. This keeps the chat alive with community members watching each other stake their $PO to see if they can grow their share. So far there is bl\*ckjack and 13. Roule\*te and Pok\*r are also soon to be introduced.  
   
Where is $PO at now?

* **Low market cap** - It’s currently at a really low market cap of only 80k, making it a great opportunity for early investors and people chasing 100x coins. But also whales thanks to great liquidity pool 
* **Alpha access to the c**\***sino feature** - Join in with the new feature.
* **Fast growing community** - The chat is active, and the atmosphere is unique.
* **Airdrop rewards** - \*\*\*k Yeah. Starting at higher market cap to holders.
* **KOLs incoming** - There will be Influencers on-boarded to further develop the marketability. Smaller ones at 100k market cap and bigger ones later.
* **Sustainable marketing** - There has not been much so far in terms of marketing as the foundations are being laid, leaving a lot of room for growth after trustworthy people are on-boarded and create strong floor.

This project brings something new and will definitely attract people that want some type of innovation. If you want to find out more about this project check our website or join our Telegram. But hurry up, $PO will not be this cheap much longer.

SOL,CryptoMoon,"Pojak $PJ on Solana, getting ready to skyrocket.","Hey everyone,

If you still didn't hear about Pojak $PJ CTO, you are missing on the next biggest project for this meme run. Let me tell you why.

**How this story started?**

Pojak got rugged at about 40k, and that's when James, the CTO leader, + the amazing team jumped in at around 8k and took it to a massive ATH of 2.6M. On the way, lots of utility was dropped, which will be on the spotlight this run.

**Why is this successful? Because:**

**Best Community Ever:** Honestly the $PJ CTO community is the best community that has ever existed. People are so friendly, and everyone is just in high spirits. From sharing memes, motivation and even idea sharing, there isn’t a better feeling here than feeling like you are a part of a community. 🚀💪

**Stunning Art and Website:** The website layout for Pojak is beyond awesome. Visually, it is sharp, colorful and doesn’t miss the point of meme generation and sharing at all. The site is very intuitive, filled with information, and the design is also spectacular. When it comes to the details, the Pojak website is truly unique.. 🎨🌐

**Amazing partnerships:** Teams background and connections gave the possibility to $PJ to connect with BIG names on this industry, like Nick Rose, Scotty, Gandalf, Caleb, and many others, as well as partner with insane projects like Brett, gigachad, among others.

**The utility:** Last but not least, the utility thrown on the table is what makes Pojak unique. Pojak created a content hub called meme-flix, which is the netflix for crypto, where meme and non meme fans can jump into the hub, and watch the amazing content for more than 80 projects that are in there. So now, instead of Netflix and chill, we will Meme-flix and shill.

Finally, the team is working on an OUTSTANDING update that will bring HUGE investments across the board. Excited? Hope you are.

SOL,CryptoMoon,8-Bit Coin changing the whole Solana GameFi space ,"“We have created $COIN in 2024 with one simple goal, to render it as the most valuable gaming-focused asset”. -Team

8-Bit Coin will probably never stop surprising me. When you look at the chart and market cap you would think that the team spend enormous amounts of money on marketing, calls, partnerships etc. But the opposite is the truth. To date, there has been almost 0 marketing. Only some Reddit posts and 1 single small partnership.

So no, I am not joking when I say 8-Bit Coin will be the biggest GameFi project on Solana.

And the reason? Well, it is very simple. The people on the team are BONK whales. And when I say whales I mean one of the biggest holders of BONK. And they made this coin with 1 goal. To level up game development on Solana network.

Just imagine what will happen once the real bull-run starts and they start with paid marketing. BONK partnership, big institutions, articles everywhere.

8-Bit Coin is a great investment right now because as one of the community members said “Literally the easiest buy and hold, number goes up like the s&p.” So you can make nice 2x at this stage with no marketing and shitty market. BUT!!!!! Once they start, holy macaroni this will be insane.

8-Bit Coin is one of those projects that everyone should have in their portfolio if they want some nice safe returns.

SOL,CryptoMoon,"The Return of r/ wallstreetbets on Solana and the New Meta
","**Why is r/ wallstreetbets Making a Comeback?**  
Remember r/ wallstreetbets? The legendary subreddit that turned the financial world upside down and gave retail traders a shot at massive gains is back—this time on Solana. This community, which turned memes into market-shaking moves, made history before, and they’re ready to do it again. With a fresh start on a new platform, r/ wallstreetbets is reigniting the wild energy that once dominated the markets. Whether you’re chasing the thrill or hunting for gains, this is where the real action is.

**Themed Subreddits and the Rise of Reddit-Inspired Tokens**  
Recently, we've seen a wave of tokens inspired by Reddit hit the scene. Themed subreddits like r/ Snoofi, r/ Limmy, and r/ circle are getting a lot of attention, but the standout so far? Reddit Dog. Is this just another trend, or is it the new meta? r/ wallstreetbets is taking this concept and running with it, potentially turning it into the next big thing. With its deep roots in market-shifting culture, this community is poised to lead the charge.

**Get Ready for the Next Big Pump**  
The buzz is growing, the charts are heating up, and it seems we’re on the verge of another r/ wallstreetbets pump. For those in the know, this could be the opportunity you've been waiting for. Whispers of whales waking up and the market gearing up for a significant move are circulating—now’s the time to position yourself. Keep an eye on the signals, prepare your buy orders, and get ready for a wild ride when this takes off.

**Market Reversal: Is r/ wallstreetbets Leading the Charge?**  
After a period of dips and sideways movement, the market is finally showing signs of a bullish reversal. The sentiment is shifting, and the bulls are back in action. If you’ve been waiting on the sidelines, now might be the perfect time to jump back in. With its new base on Solana, r/ wallstreetbets is well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum. The reversal is real, and the gains could be substantial—don’t miss out.

**r/ wallstreetbets: Still Challenging the Status Quo**  
Why r/ wallstreetbets? This is where retail traders came together to flip the script on Wall Street. Born out of a desire to challenge the suits, this community shook the markets and made history.

SOL,CryptoMoon,Hegecoin ($HEGE): The Solana Meme Coin That's Poised for Explosive Gains,"Are you ready for the next big thing in the world of Solana meme coins? Look no further than Hegecoin ($HEGE)! 🦔

$HEGE has been making waves in the Solana community, and for good reason. With a unique blend of storytelling, community engagement, and solid fundamentals, $HEGE is a project that's built for the long haul.

But don't just take our word for it - let's look at the facts. $HEGE has already achieved some incredible milestones:

* CEX listing on the horizon
* Massive marketing push underway
* Consistent growth in holders and community engagement

These are the kinds of developments that smart investors look for when they're trying to identify undervalued projects. And make no mistake, $HEGE is incredibly undervalued right now.

Consider this: at the time of writing, $HEGE has a market cap of around $7 million. If $HEGE were to reach a market cap of $35 million (which is entirely realistic given the potential of this project), that would represent a 5x return. In other words, if you invested $1,000 now, you could be looking at a $5,000 payday.

But the potential for gains with $HEGE goes far beyond just the short term. This is a project with a real vision and a dedicated team behind it. As $HEGE continues to grow and achieve new milestones, the sky is truly the limit.

Of course, every investment carries risk, and $HEGE is no different. But the beauty of getting in early on a project like this is that the risk-to-reward ratio is heavily skewed in your favor. By buying low and holding on for the ride, you're setting yourself up for potentially massive gains.

And let's not forget the power of the $HEGE community. This is a group of passionate, dedicated individuals who believe in the vision of $HEGE and are working tirelessly to make it a reality. When you invest in $HEGE, you're not just buying a token - you're becoming part of a movement.

So if you're looking for the next big opportunity in the Solana meme coin space, $HEGE should be at the top of your list. With a solid foundation, an engaged community, and a clear path to gains, this is a project that ticks all the boxes.

Don't miss out on this chance to get in on the ground floor of something truly special. Join the $HEGE army today and let's ride this rocket to the moon together!

It’s called Bullcat. The ticker is $BULLY.

There’s a presale happening in a few days, and trust me, you don’t want to miss it. 

Cats have been all over social media lately, with over a million posts on the timeline in the past month. 

Now, this trend is ready to lead Solana’s rise to the top.

Solana has made a name for itself as one of the fastest blockchain networks out there. With its growing popularity, it looks like we’re heading into a significant bull run.

Bullcat is set to be a big part of that story.

Once we hit 10M mcap, it will be blatantly obvious to people that this is the next big play with WIF-like moonshot potential.

Target price? The sky's the limit. We are talking hundreds of millions, probably billions. 

This is a project that can flip Michi first, Popcat second and then WIF. It’s just better in every way. 



The presale is on the 7th August 2024, so now is your chance to get in early.



Fade this at your own risk.

SOL,CryptoMoon,"Solana’s Next Big Thing: LandWolf’s Surge in the Meme Coin Market
","In the dynamic realm of cryptocurrencies, meme coins often present the most tantalizing opportunities for swift wealth generation. Even in a bearish market, enthusiasts and speculators are on the lookout for the next big leap that could secure them substantial gains.

Enter LandWolf, a rising star associated with the popular Pepe meme. Boasting a market cap exceeding $91 million and a 24-hour trading volume surpassing $35 million, $WOLF is poised to become Solana's leading meme coin.

Read on to explore the potential of LandWolf and how it stacks up against well-known meme coins like Pepe and Brett.

LandWolf (WOLF): A Meme Coin Revolution on Solana

Tied closely to Pepe the Frog, LandWolf is a fresh meme coin aiming to bridge Pepe’s fanbase with the wider crypto community. Its engaging and playful nature has sparked significant buzz, putting $WOLF on a fast track to becoming Solana's top meme coin.

As a core member of the Boys Club, LandWolf has earned the trust and support of the degen community. With over 5k active members on Telegram and more than 5k followers on X, WOLF’s popularity is surging. Influencers like InvestWithRex, who famously bought a purple Lamborghini to showcase his confidence in the project, are among its supporters.

LandWolf's potential is underscored by its association with the Boys Club team. With $PEPE valued at approximately $5 billion and $BRETT at $1.3 billion, LandWolf appears poised to join the ranks of multi-billion dollar projects soon. The pressing question is: will you seize this opportunity early, or miss out on a potential six-figure gain?

Pepe (PEPE): The Meme Coin Phenomenon

Pepe, inspired by a beloved internet meme from the early 2000s, ranks as the third-largest meme coin by market cap. Despite its lack of practical use, $PEPE soared in May 2023, minting overnight millionaires. Now a staple in the meme coin space, Pepe sparked a new wave of crypto enthusiasm.

Currently priced at $0.00001118, Pepe has seen an 8% decline over the past week. This dip is a normal market fluctuation and unlikely to impact the project’s long-term prospects. For now, undervalued projects with significant upside and robust teams offer the best investment potential.

Brett (BRETT): Base Chain’s Meme Coin Marvel

BRETT, another Boys Club-inspired meme coin, has made waves on the Base blockchain. Despite lacking a clear roadmap or utility, BRETT has cultivated a dedicated community, reaching a $1.9 billion ATH in June.

BRETT’s price recently stabilized around $0.14 after a peak of $0.15. This correction is typical post-ATH behavior and shouldn’t affect the coin’s long-term value.

Conclusion

While the market undergoes a minor correction, LandWolf is steadily gaining momentum. With a strong team and a loyal community, $WOLF is on track to dominate Solana's meme coin landscape by 2024. Don't miss this potential 100x investment opportunity.

Invest in $WOLF today and join the Solana degens!

SOL,CryptoMoon,Why You Should Join the Doogle Gang: A New Meme Sensation on Solana,"Hey everyone!

I just had to share my excitement about Doogle – the latest sensation that's taking the meme world by storm! If you haven't heard of Doogle yet, you're in for a treat. Created by the genius Matt Furie, the same guy who gave us Pepe the Frog, Doogle is this hilarious and lovable dog character that seems to find himself in the silliest of situations.

So, what makes Doogle stand out? Well, in 2024, Doogle took an unexpected turn and became a digital superstar thanks to the Solana blockchain. Someone had the brilliant idea to tokenize Doogle, and suddenly, everyone wanted a piece of this goofy dog. Trading Doogle tokens became the new craze, and the value of these digital collectibles shot through the roof.

But it's not just about the tokens. The Doogle community is something truly special. Every time we hit a new milestone, a new chapter of Doogle's story is revealed, keeping everyone engaged and on their toes. And starting from chapter 5, there are some fantastic rewards up for grabs, like NFTs and airdrops. It feels like being part of an epic adventure where we all get to share in the fun and excitement.

The future of Doogle looks incredibly bright. The roadmap is packed with exciting plans and rewards as we reach new milestones. The ultimate goal is to continue unveiling more of Doogle's story, keeping the community thrilled and involved.

What I love most about Doogle is the positivity and joy it brings to the meme community. It's amazing to see how this quirky dog has gone from an obscure meme to a blockchain superstar, all thanks to the power of creativity and community. Doogle's journey is proof that with the right support and platform, even the most unexpected characters can become icons.

If you're looking for a fun, engaging, and rewarding digital experience, I can't recommend Doogle enough. Join us in the Doogle gang and be part of this incredible journey. Let's keep the momentum going and make history together!

- Great Market Cap to Liquidity Pool ratio of 5x ($1.3 mil market cap with $261k liquidity)

- Holder distribution has continued to improve. Holder count increased by ~600 people over the past week to ~3,500. The 3nd largest whale took profits and sold his entire stake in 24 hours. Because of increasing demand, the price of HEGE actually rose slightly during that time.

- HEGE price is up about 30% over the past week with fairly little volatility (by memecoin standards).

SOL,CryptoMoon,Will $CEEZUR really conquer Solana?,"Ever heard of $CEEZUR? I bet you already have because it is on every subreddit in existence. It is up 500% in the last 2 days and it will go MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT!!

We have absolutely crazy community. We lost a lot at the beginning of this week but we did not give up. Our dev got hacked and lost all his tokens. But instead of quitting, he started buying everything back. Community did not sell. We started shilling as hard as possible, created many new memes and most importandly worked as a team. This is why we are back above 100k.

But believe me when I tell you, 100k will be a joke in just a few months. Devs are working on dexscreener update, animations of $CEEZUR and future giveaways.

$100 will be worth over 10k once we hit 10M market cap. And believe me, THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN!!

SOL,CryptoMoon,WIFE - A Bullish CTO for Solana's Most Undervalued Meme Coin,"**Introduction**

Hey everyone,

I’ve been diving deep into meme coins recently in anticipation of the next big run once BTC and ETH cool off a bit and money starts to flow back in to the low caps. And I’ve come across something that I think could be a real hidden gem on the Solana blockchain. It’s called $WIFE, and the team describe themselves as more than a simple meme coin. Instead, $WIFE is the token of what they call a “decentralized media company”, based on the hugely popular new Wifejak meme which has recently started to spread from Twitter to Instagram, Facebook, and Tik-Tok. Wifejak was originally based on a simple picture of a modified female wojak paired with funny and typical sayings a female partner might make, but she has since grown into a versatile meme character similar to Tradwife and Wojak, and she is appearing across the internet in a wild variety of innovative and hilarious memes.

$WIFE has recently undergone a community takeover (CTO), with the original developer missing in action, and now the community is driving the project forward. I want to share why I believe this is incredibly bullish for $WIFE and outline some exciting developments on their roadmap that caught my eye.

**The Bullish Case for CTOs in Crypto**

A community takeover (CTO) happens when the original creators of a cryptocurrency project hand over control to the community. This is a big deal – it shifts the power to the users, making the project more decentralized and often more resilient.

**Successful Examples:** We’ve seen other projects thrive under community control. The OG example is $DOGE, of course. Started as a joke but took on a life of its own, with huge rewards for early believers. A more recent example is $BODEN, which was abandoned early by the dev but then taken over by a community who saw the power of the meme.

**Community Strength:** The strength of a community can’t be overstated. When the users take charge, there’s often more passion and innovation driving the project. People are more invested in the success of something they have a say in, which can lead to better decisions and more sustainable growth. And the $WIFE community certainly has this strength. The Wifejak meme is wildly popular and likely to have staying power and reach beyond crypto twitter – it is a real phenomenon.

**Overview of $WIFE**

**Team:** The team at $WIFE describe it as more than just your typical meme coin. They are building a decentralized media company, with plans for merchandise, games, partnerships and more. There are some really professional people working on WIFE, and the passion and creativity is evident in their daily output of memes, art work and hilarious twitter posts.

**Tokenomics:** $WIFE was launched from Pump(dot)fun, meaning that it has no possibility of being rugged by the now defunct dev. A few early whales have dumped and run, but there are just as many who have held strong and never sold a single coin. The coin is well distributed, with 1.3k holders at a sub $1.5m market cap – HUGE room for growth here.

**Ecosystem:** $WIFE aims to create a robust ecosystem that includes partnerships with other blockchain projects and community-driven initiatives. Forging ties with other meme coins and doing cross coin artwork and promotions has elevated $WIFE and given them a good network of supportive partners. I expect this to continue as they grow and the meme space grows with them.

**Roadmap Highlights**

$WIFE recently launched a new road map in their telegram which is well worth checking out. I’ve highlighted some important points below;

**Upcoming Milestones**

* **Community initiatives:** $WIFE has a number of planned upcoming partnerships and cooperative ventures with other meme coins and projects. I expect this to grow their profile and network, and this could well translate into increased visibility and attractiveness to new buyers.
* **Wifejak Online Game:** Some kind of computer game is in development, which could be a great way to attract and retain users. Gaming and crypto go hand-in-hand, and this could be a big hit. With the wealth of art assets at $WIFEs disposal, whatever they do in this space could be really interesting.
* **Wifejak Online Store:** Set to launch soon, the store will offer a range of items, apparel, plushies, and accessories. Notably – 2% of all sales will go towards a buy back and burn mechanism. I’m not sure I’ve seen something like this implemented with a meme coin before, and it should have a positive effect on the price action for the $WIFE token – turning it deflationary!

**Community Engagement and Future Prospects**

**Engagement Strategies:** $WIFE is all about community engagement. They’re active on social media, host events, and really listen to feedback from their users. This kind of interaction ensures that the community feels valued and heard.

**Future Potential:** Looking ahead, the potential for $WIFE seems strong. Their roadmap is ambitious but achievable, and with a passionate community behind it, the project has a good chance of making significant strides. The focus on continuous innovation and decentralized governance is a winning combination.

**Conclusion**

To wrap things up, the bullish case for $WIFE is compelling. After the rocky road to a successful CTO, $WIFE is now poised for bigger things. With a solid roadmap and strong community engagement, I see $WIFE as a standout meme coin project for anyone looking to participate in the next wave of meme coin runs.

In the degen world OG memes offer the best avenue for meme investors and this is why many people believe that OG memes are up next.

OG memes naturally have a leg up on the market in terms of familiarity,  virality, and marketing and some OG memes seem like they're built for crypto. Overly Attached Girlfriend is unique from other memes and offers unique, versatile aesthetics and humor that is sets it apart from the rest. She is both funny AND fun to look at. Not only that, but she's also willing to slash and burn her way to the top

Nano cap OG memes like Overly Attached Girlfriend have potential for face melting upside that can speed run your portfolio back on track FAST ... And BY THE WAY the dev just burned a quarter of the supply of the tokens. This is giga bullish!

SOL,CryptoMoon,$MONK Is About To Rocket!!! Get In Now! Barbershops Being Built In Space! Solana ETF Speculation Will Send Solana Memes To the Moon! ,"Greetings Monkeys, Barbers, Boys, and Girls!

With the buzz around the new Solana ETF making waves, it's time to strap in because we're about to witness some serious price action in the Solana ecosystem. 

New bullish investing trends have already started and with the new ETF news, new investors are setting their sights on Solana, and with good reason.

$Monk holders already saw a 30+% spike this week with another price pump VERY clearly imminent with barber scissors clearly cutting thru a resistance zone as I type this message.

The price is already showing signs of a pump this week, and as the market finds its footing, we're going to see a flock of newbies and normies gravitating towards solana the familiar (in addition to seasoned veterans)... Which means the highest quality tokens with culture and community already built-in as well as, of course, OG MEMES which already have built in viral energy.

With this all in mind Monkey Haircut's community is building new barber shops on the moon!

In the world of investing you shouldn't be chasing green candles and the tokens that already had big runs upward.. It's about finding the tokens that are DOWN already and are awaiting an IMMINENT PUMP.
