TRX,cryptocurrency,Why is Justin Sun a Scammer and Tron a Fraudulent Crypto Project? ,"Anyone who is active on this sub knows there is a great disdain for Justin Sun and Tron. With the sub frequently comparing Sun and any projects he's involved with to things like Do Kwon/Terra Luna, SBF/FTX, and CP Zhao.

Yet unlike the names mentioned above Tron continues to move in and out of the top 10 crypto projects by market cap and Justin Sun continues to grow his Crypto empire with frequent news stories about large purchases of ETH and other crypto assets. Obviously not collapsing (yet) doesn't mean Justin Sun isn't a scammer and Tron isn't a fraudulent project - it just means it hasn't collapsed yet.

So the question is why is Justin Sun a scammer and why is Tron a Fraudulent Crypto Project? What hard evidence exists, what is just circle jerking, and what is simply speculative concern?",62,2024-07-06 15:55:31,92
TRX,cryptocurrency,How is Tron the 9th biggest cryptocurrency?!,"Tron goes under the radar, even if it has been around for 6 years (2017), which is like a thousand years in crypto. 

But whenever I read about Ton (TRX), people always say that it is a terrible project and that its founder, Justin Sun, is not to be trusted. Justin Sun is always in the news for saying something stupid and trying to advertise Tron. Usually he is just a source for memes:

&#x200B;

I believe Tron even started out as a scam with a plagiarized whitepaper?? Although that is true for other projects also.

Yet here we are: Tron is the 9th biggest ryptocurrency with a 6.2 billion market cap. 

https://preview.redd.it/0si2htd5ee5b1.png?width=1023&format=png&auto=webp&s=5585f8a428dc09c11ef9d4a833c5297228d44375

It would even be 7th if you do not count stablecoins.

Over the last 90 days, Tron is also one of the few cryptocurrencies that is actually in the green with a modest +2.4%. So it has performed relatively well.

TRX,cryptocurrency,"So... are we going to ignore that TRON (TRX), with 7.5 BILLION market cap, is pretty much following LUNA's footsteps?","[TRON (TRX) is currently the #14 coin by market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/). The coin has seen an insane increase over the past couple months.

TRON has recently launched its algorithmic stablecoin [USDD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usdd/). The algorithm governing the stablecoin’s dollar-peg is an arbitrage trade between USDD and TRX, Tron's network’s native token. *Hmm... this reminds me of something but I can't put my finger on it....*

Now here's this week's best offer! [You can earn up to 57% through sun.io's LP!](https://imgur.com/a/JoFQgSH) What a great deal.

According to [Defillama](https://defillama.com/peggedassets/stablecoins) USDD is #10 stablecoin by market cap, with a 20% increase over the past week, this figure is up from $90 million recorded during its day of launch on **May 5, 2022**. *Hmm... I have a vouge memory of something that happened in early May 2022...*

Oh and we haven't even checked the **project's founder, Justin Sun.**

Let's get started:

Justin Sun launched TRON's whitepaper during the ICO craze in 2017, days before China's ban on ICO's. He raised $70 million and left the country. Sun had been **tipped off by Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance.** Does this also sound familiar....? 

On top of that. [it's been also reported that he copy pasted the project's whitepaper from another coin](https://coincentral.com/community-accuses-tron-plagiarizing-whitepaper/). This only adds to the pile of cards that his so called ""algorithmic stablecoin"" is a scam waiting to collapse.

It is no coincidence that Justin also left China, days after the ICO ban was announced.

On top of all that, it's been reported that:

* He hosted a ton of fake giveaways in 2019 announcing fake winners and retracting prizes.

* He announced fake partnerships with big organizations such as Liverpool F.C., who have denied connections.

* It's been reported that Justin has sold most of his TRON coins after the ICO and bought a large chunk of ETH. Some say he owns more ETH than the projects' Co-Founder Vitalik.

[You can read more here](https://www.theverge.com/c/22947663/justin-sun-tron-cryptocurrency-poloniex)

So, what do we make of all these? Justin Sun, the creator of TRX and USDD, not only literally copy pasted everything, he has also been involved in a huge amount of sketchy dealings and scams. 

My hope is that people like Justin and projects like LUNA and TRX are wiped off entirely from the market, for this is the only way to move forward and build something meaningful.

TRX,cryptocurrency,"STAY AWAY FROM TRON/TUSD: Justin Sun, the owner, is printing money out of thin air and might trigger another FTX-like crisis","It seems Justin Sun has turned the Iron blockchain into his piggy bank. Looking at his verified crypto address one cam easily see some shady transactions. He just minted $62 million in TUSD, withdrew $50 million in USDT from Huobi, deposited $50 million USDT to Bitfinex, and burned $50 million TUSD. He also added $50 million USDT and $12 million TUSD to JustLend. This tactic of minting and immediately burning clearly shows that he's showing debtors he has TUSD which he doesn't have, just like  Sam Bankman Fried did.

TRX,cryptocurrency,I entered a Tron Telegram group with 24.000 people in order to get info about tech. An unbelievable experience.,"So I'm writing this article about the top 15 crypto projects. 
It's an IOTA blog, but this article is not aiming at ""IOTA IS THE WINNER"" or so, I absolutely don't care. 

Everyone can get rich, 3842% ROI I don't care. It's a neutral comparison.

I want to look for fields of application, feasibility, similarities, problems, rumours.

As neutral as I can. 

I can't find information about Tron, the whitepaper doesn't answer the questions, there's not a single entry in google about it. 

While entering the telegram group with 24.000 members(!), the first thing I see is a dude asking: 

""so should I buy more TRON?""

a guy named kaan answered ""If you can, yes"" 

I asked: ""I'm looking for information about Tron in terms of the CAP theorem, does anyone know if Tron is partition tolerant?

syed efti writes ""when 1000 sat""

someone writes: ""PUMP THE SHITTT""

and I ask ""this group is not really tech savvy is it?"" 

Someone answered. ""Bro you got google""

I answer: ""bro, try to google it, there are ZERO answers""

he sais ""not doing your work""

I say: ""I'm trying to write an article, I want basic tech-info about Tron, is there ANY expertise in here?""

A moderator-bot comes up and deletes a question of ""Dennis"" who is looking for a developer of Tron for an exchange listing

The bot answers: These questions are not allowed, next time you will get banned.

TRX,cryptocurrency,Something fishy is going on with the Tron Accelerator $1m developer contest,"[Tron Accelerator](https://tronaccelerator.io/) is (allegedly) a $1m contest for TRX dapp developers. Being someone who has been highly active in all blockchain dapp scenes, I have been watching this unfold. I figured I'd post it here so you guys can help put the pieces together.

Basically, tons of supposed USDT prizes for people to win by developing on TRX. This is the main reason why some eth devs decided to port games to TRX  - Not because they are ""jumping ship"" like the shillers want you to believe (In fact many of them who I know personally still plan to continue developing on Eth). They just wanted a piece of the contest prizes and its pretty easy to put an eth dapp onto tron.

Anyways, yesterday was supposed to be when they decide winners. The results werent announced and people started to get anxious. Finally today they said that they emailed all the winners. Inside the email included the following:

>Due to the unexpectedly high volume of competitive projects, we have made some adjustments to the prize structure, one of them is to award over 100+ projects instead of 56 projects. More details to be announced soon. Please stay tuned:)

Apparently they decided to change the prize payouts, dropping the lowest prize to $1k instead of $5k. Many people were upset about this in the official tron dev discord feeling they had been mislead. Some even seem to think there is something deeper going on. For example, one Super Representative candidate posts:

>Nobody even knows that they'll pay out the full 1,000,000 I can guarantee they won't. They didn't pay out the full amount last competition They're not cutting prize amounts because so many people supposedly entered, they're cutting them because they won't pay the full amount. 100 winners is not better than 57 when the majority of those winners took 30 minutes to reskin an existing smart contract on the network You can make all the excuses you want, or try to see the good in it but you're only lying to yourself When we got $75k shaved off our prize, we weren't happy because 100 winners were better than 57. They didn't even pick winners for some of the prizes.

&#x200B;

There were some people who said they received the email and won $1k, but interestingly nobody was coming out in the public saying they won a large prize. After some sleuthing, we found this [instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsgCyyGAHv-/) of apparently some random person associated with ""STOken Studio"" who appears to have won the $200k prize. Dont bother trying to google it, nothing will come up. All we were able to find about this mysterious project was this [embarassingly empty github](https://github.com/chews/stoken) with only 3 commits \[edit: it has been deleted or made private 1 day after making this post\], and this  [https://stokenstudio.firebaseapp.com/](https://stokenstudio.firebaseapp.com/) . The [smart contract code](https://github.com/chews/stoken/blob/master/contractAgent/chalicelib/STOken.sol) is nonexistent and if the website is even doing anything, it appears to be on shasta testnet. Upon analysis, one of the SR candidates from the discord jokes that this ""dapp"" is just a microsoft word plugin.

Additionally in the FAQs on tron accel website it clearly says entrants must be on mainnet:

>Can I develop a DApp that does not use smart contracts, but does use TRX?  
>  
>Yes, you can. It is OK for you to not use TVM, but you have to be on the Mainnet.

Grand prize aside, some other funny stuff: One dev decided to clone ""Shrimp Farm"" from eth to tron just as an experiment. It surprisingly got a ton of volume despite being a simple ponzi game. This led to a huge amount of clones onto tron, including Tron Anthills, Crocs, and many others. Surprisingly, although Tron Shrimp clearly had the most volume, users, and txns, it did not win a prize. BUT ONE OF THE CLONES OF THIS CLONE DID! The Anthills developer ""diego"" posted to his community that he was one of the winners!

**To summarize, so far:**

* They changed the prizes *after* the contest ended
* They allowed clones to win but not the original clone onto TRX
* They allowed contestants to win who didnt meet the criteria (being on mainnet)
* They allowed projects that arent open source to win
* The Grand Winner is a mysterious project with barely any info available
* They havent posted a public list of the winners
* Some blatant ponzi games have won prizes

If you want to watch this all unfold live, you can find the Tron dev discord [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/a254am/in_1_months_time_the_tron_discord_channel_has/) and go to the #tronaccelerator channel. Tons of FUD currently, bring popcorn. It will be interesting to see if they ever post a public list of the winners or if they just delay it in hopes that people eventually stop talking about it

**Update**:One of the official Judges (Vincent, Dapp.review) has appeared in the discord. Some of his comments:

>I think they did a screening before sending to judges. I didn’t see all submitted dapps  
>  
>The list we got is less than 40 dapps, I think it’s for big prize📷  
>  
>No I don’t have the final results

Paradoxically, this was the email that some developers received from Tron Accelerator:

>Dear TRON Developers,  This email is to notify you that, up to this point, TRON Accelerator final prizes have been announced through emails already, we would like to thank you for your hard work and enthusiasm in developing your dApps for the past 5 weeks!  Due to the unexpectedly high volume of competitive projects, we have made some adjustments to the prize structure, one of them is to award over 100+ projects instead of 56 projects. More details to be announced soon. Please stay tuned:)  Thanks again,

Adding to the list:

* There was a ""screening"" before the dapps were being even given to the judges (by who? based on what?)
* One of the judges himself does not have the final results yet the email claims that all prizes were announced through emails",1014,2019-01-12 03:24:18,334

Now, he might've just committed another crime by partnering with Tron (Justin Sun). Here is what he posted on his own Twitter.

so what does it all mean? It means if you would like to withdraw your assets out of FTX, you have a choice of swapping your whatever assets to TRX, BTT, JST, SUN, and HT token. They are owned by Justin Sun. Here is a funny part and I could say outright this is illegal. The man just try to reduce his liabilities by f\*\*king his users once more time.

This is the price of TRX on spot market on FTX.

Basically, if you have $1 million dollars worth of assets and you would like to withdraw via Huobi (owned by Justin Sun). You would have to buy TRX, then send it to Huobi, then sell it. At the end, you lost nearly 5 times, end up having only $200k.

Want to see another token allowed to withdraw 1:1. HT (Huobi)

Not only the users was already f\*\*\*ed. This clown decided to f\*\*\* them once more time. Either you got something (4-5 times less than what you own) or nothing. It is like take it or leave it.

This clown just want to reduce his debt and decided to sacrifice his customers.

Who benefits in the end?

1. Sam Bankman-Fried, because he reduces his liability.
2. Justin Sun. He sends his tokens to FTX and sells them who needs to get out from FTX.

Those people are the reasons for outsiders and governments around the world to attack cryptos in general.

Well, let them all die so we could move on.

I mean, what the hell law enforcement in the US is doing? Just allow it to happen?

Let me get it straight: I have no tokens locked up on FTX nor I own any tokens associated with him and Justin Sun. But seeing this kinda action harming the crypto industry and people makes me sick.

I don't know what to advise you guys who have tokens locked up there. Maybe seek advice from your lawyers.

Edit #1: He has a hole of $9 billion dollars, right (probably lost due to a psychopath in Alameda Research, who lost it all to yield farming and seeding new project). If all users and investors decide to get out of FTX via this kinda mechanism, basically he only owes those people $1.8 billion dollars. Because people decide to take 4-5 times loss.

USDD has already lost its peg for a while, it was down to 0.99 instead of $1.

Poloniex is ofcourse owned by Tron/Justin Sun, who are now using it to push their own instable ""stablecoin"" at a time when the paint of a stablecoin collapsing is not even dry.

TRX,cryptocurrency,Tron already launched its stablecoin and it looks very similar to terra USD,"The range of stablecoins or stable cryptocurrencies has recently added a new alternative. It is Decentralized USD (USDD) or ""decentralized USD"", a cryptocurrency from the Tron network that has parity with the US dollar and relies on an algorithm for its issuance.

The positive thing about this is that the integration of an algorithmic stablecoin is that it guarantees the inclusion of new projects and blockchain development by having a stable and operable pair for such ecosystem, so most likely we will soon be observing projects in pre-sale and pre-launch phase for the TRX blockchain as LunaFi, Minosis Token, CHO and among all kinds of emerging and promising projects for the Tron ecosystem.

This Tron stablecoin focuses on decentralization, lead developer Justin Sun explained when announcing the project. The idea regarding its market value is that it will maintain 1:1 parity with the US dollar, as do other stablecoins such as Tether (USDT), USD coin (USDC) or DAI (DAI).

The first USDD units were issued on May 5. According to its official Twitter account, its main features are high transaction speed, low fees and scalability potential.

In addition to Tron, the stablecoin is available on Ethereum and BNB Chain networks. Twenty days after its launch, it has already accumulated a market capitalization of USD 544 million, according to CoinGecko data.

On the morning of May 25 (UTC), the cryptocurrency had a brief depeg (i.e., it lost parity with its underlying asset, the dollar) and reached its historical low of USD 0.98, although it has already recovered its original value.

According to the project's whitepaper, the next stages include the launch of the USDD test network and the main USDD network, projected for October 10 and November 30, respectively. From December 30, meanwhile, USDD would be available for any Tron mainnet user to issue the stablecoin.


For the time being, however, the USDD stablecoin can already be purchased on decentralized finance protocols (DeFi) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) such as Uniswap, Curve Finance, Kyber Network, PancakeSwap, SunSwap and Poloniex. It can also be traded on centralized exchanges such as Huobi, KuCoin, Poloniex, gate.io, Bitget, Bybit and LBank.

With respect to reserves backing investors against potential failures of the algorithm, Tron envisions the creation of the autonomous decentralized Tron Reserve DAO (Tron Reserve), which will initially raise USD 10,000 from investments from ""blockchain industry players."" This first stage in USDD's history, which began on May 5, relies mostly on the participation of institutional players.",216,2022-05-27 17:52:36,163

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.

20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that

24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.

50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",14814,2021-02-09 12:03:25,1588

TRX,cryptocurrency,Get your crypto off Binance now. The bromance between CZ and Tron’s Justin Sun is the last red flag,"I can’t even keep up with the accusations against Binance and CZ. One of the biggest red flags to me is that he has a close relationship with Justin Sun, who is clearly a scammer. In this article, an analysis by YouTuber and crypto investigator Coffeezilla revealed that Sun secretly minted 94% of allegedly decentralized stablecoin USDD, then advertised an alarming “392% to 584%” APY staking program on Sun.io. His Huobi exchange token also tanked by 93% in minutes today before Sun said he was putting 100 million USDD to provide liquidity blaming a few leveraged positions causing the crash. 93%?? 

CZ being connected to Sun either as a business partner or as a friend is a terrible sign. Get your crypto off now and into a cold wallet. If you are letting your coins sit on Binance then don’t cry to this sub afterwards when you lose them. And if you own any Tron you must hate money.

TRX,cryptocurrency,"Binance Moved $2.7 Billion Out Of 'Proof Of Reserves' Wallet Less Than 24 Hours After Publishing Proof of Reserves, Additional Funds Also 'Missing'","Binance(through CZ) was the company that said that users should get their funds off exchanges. They claimed customer assets are fully backed on Binance.  They said you shouldn't trust (other) exchanges and championed proof of reserves. Then they published their proof of reserves *article* on 10th November at about UTC 13:00:00 or 1PM UTC (the actual snapshot taken earlier obviously) . But **only 20 hours** after publishing, Binance moved 2.7 Billion USDT to another wallet. This wallet is not disclosed or tagged as a Binance wallet and not present in their ""Proof of Reserves"" publishing. 

&#x200B;

[Transfer Out of 'Proof of Reserves' Wallet](https://preview.redd.it/dd1yvaxnzi0a1.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c7c5d1a8cb03b83dceecd45089068521dd1cc08)

Then **only just yesterday**, 200 Million tokens were transferred back into a disclosed Binance wallet leaving around 2.5 Billion Tether left in the new undisclosed strange wallet.

&#x200B;

There are also some additional funds missing from other wallets in their proof of reserves snapshot. The second Tron Binance wallet is missing around 2.4 Billion and the third is missing 500 Million(screenshots in Appendix). The bulk of these funds seem to have went missing on the 14th Nov.

. 

In the case of the second and third wallets, at least these funds *might* be explained by users actually withdrawing although this can be up for debate. Even then, there's no way to explain an exchange simple shifting billions in funds into some brand new undisclosed wallet in the case of the first wallet. And they did this **only 20 hours** after publishing their 'proof' of reserves snapshot. 

Sure, companies have the right to manage and store their funds in whatever way they like. They aren't bound to keep it in any particular wallet. But that begs the question, why not just disclose their new wallet with a simple addition to their published proof of reserves statement. Why not properly organize and manage their funds so that they wouldn't look shady making such transactions after  the fact(of publishing reserves). Why not even post something as basic as tweet to provide transparency to users in all of the chaos we are experiencing now as the CEO tweets about things of much less significance. They should know trust in the space is at an all time low.  But instead, users like me have to dig through tons of data to figure out something they could have easily disclosed. Shady as heck. Whether this is funny business they are engaged in or just management incompetence, either way it is not good at all.

TRX,cryptocurrency,FTX Is Taking Back Funds From Users Who Withdrew on 11th November,"FTX official Twitter released an update yesterday that some number of users who withdrew funds from FTX International on the 11th face having these funds taken back. It is not certain what group or number of users are affected. The funds are being returned to FTX, to be accessible and adjudicated upon by bankruptcy courts. As it is the entire FTX group including FTX US that filed for bankruptcy, it is unclear why FTX has not stated that this also affects FTX US withdrawals.

&#x200B;

This most likely refers to Bahamian funds on the platform where SBF and FTX both (in separate similar tweets) claim that Bahamian regulators mandated FTX International to permit withdrawals by Bahamian citizens, a claim strongly later denied by the regulators.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/93v9z21t1a1a1.png?width=574&format=png&auto=webp&s=72b67fb8a4f367294b59bb3f03dc7ed43b1709bb

FTX and SBF also agreed to a credit facility with Justin Sun and his DAO Tron to permit withdrawals but only using Sun-owned token BTT,  TRX, SUN, JST, and HT. This credit facility was instituted 10th Nov such that FTX may also be referring to funds transferred out through this facility on the 11th as well, as any assets left on the platform at bankruptcy time would have already been declared through courts.

Lastly, very confusingly, Bahamas regulators have acknowledged seizing assets from FTX. However it is also very unclear whether this seizure refers to the entire sum of missing funds of FTX assets or just some portion of it. The tweet may *also* be referring to the 'stolen' sum of money that represents the balance of what regulators did not seize. These funds however are only reclaimable if the hacker(s) made a rookie move and utilized centralized exchanges.",2789,2022-11-21 10:55:43,1031

Justin Suns plans for USDD also got revealed during the UST hype. He wanted to once again replicate an already existing system just for relevancy. His plan went silent after the UST collapse, but USDD is shockingly still running (even the 65th crypto by market cap) and Justin Sun still wants to add so-called ""safety"" by buying Bitcoin as a reserve for his TRON ecosystem that is already highly overvalued.

TRX,cryptocurrency,Actually unpopular opinion: Tron is a good coin.,"Oh yeah, here we go...

I play a game called Chainz Arena. It's a simple idle RPG that lets you earn real crypto, and works cross-chain allowing users to choose Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Matic, etc. Whichever crypto you choose becomes your main crypto and all withdrawals and transfers have to be done through that once you've made your choice.

A lot of newer players choose Bitcoin or Ethereum because they have a much better reputation, and who wouldn't want to make some Bitcoin or Ethereum just from playing a game? However the veteran players all know that Tron is the best choice. Instant transfers, zero fees, and no hiccups. There isn't any crypto tribalism going on over there, it's simply practicality. Tron is faster. Tron is cheaper. 

Yeah sure there are new ideas out there that are doing a great job at what they do, but this post isn't about them. 

Tron gets slept on. Apparently no one wants to make NFTs for just a few cents. Apparently people like spending money just to transfer money. People seem to like waiting 30 minutes for their money to show up. I guess people don't like making passive income on their held assets. No one wants to make Dapps with miniscule gas fees...
All this is in one coin, and it's been doing all of this for a very long time now...

Now bring the obligatory comments about how Justin Sun is a shill and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, and all that other stuff that has nothing to do with the supremacy of the technology....

TRX,cryptocurrency,"The top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence: the updated version","It's been 6 months since my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lg1yhv/for_the_newcomers_the_top_50_cryptocurrencies/) trying to sum up the biggest cryptos in a few words. I feel like an updated version is long due and so here we are.

As usual, if something is wrong or you would like to make a correction, feel free to comment. It's obviously hard to sum up each project in a few words, but I tried my best.

Terms used:

* If I refer to layer-2 solutions, that means a protocol or framework built on top of an existing blockchain and trying to increase transaction speed or scaling.
* [PoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work): Proof of Work
* [PoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake): Proof of Stake

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009 and since then it has become much more of a Store of Value than a currency, given its scarcity and high security, although layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network allows for fast and cheap transactions.
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** the coin of the Ethereum blockchain, the first smart contract platform and the one having the biggest ecosystem of decentralized applications around: since ETH price is used to pay fees to interact with the network, a bigger ecosystem means higher demand. It is (and will be) used for staking in Ethereum 2.0 (which is PoS).
3. **Tether (USDT):** the most discussed stablecoin around, pegged to the dollar price although many believe it is not fully backed: for this reason its market cap has been decreasing for the first time ever and other stablecoins are gaining traction.
4. **Binance Coin (BNB):** the official Binance coin and the one used to pay fees on the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain like Ethereum but less decentralized and with cheaper fees (not counting any layer 2 solutions).
5. **Cardano (ADA):** the coin of the PoS blockchain Cardano, created by the Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and developed strictly following peer-reviewed research, which slowed down development. Lots of partnerships and a big community make it one of the biggest ETH contenders.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** a centralized coin trying to redefine online payments, has had a rough time after the SEC went after it but seemingly it's coming out on top.
7. **USD Coin (USDC):** another stablecoin tied to the dollar and managed by the company Circle. Considered more trustworthy than Tether, it's been growing non-stop adoption-wise.
8. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** such wow, even higher ranking than last time. *sigh*
9. **Polkadot (DOT):** it's the coin of Polkadot, a multichain protocol aiming to connect different chains, both public and private, allowing to transfer data between one another or to create new custom blockchains. ChainLink's oracle pallet and Kusama are examples of projects built on top of it.
10. **Binance USD (BUSD):** another stablecoin pegged to the dollar, managed by Binance in partnership with Paxos.
11. **Uniswap (UNI):** the first token on the list, it's used to govern the decentralized trading protocol Uniswap, probably the biggest and most known DeFi application built on Ethereum.
12. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** a fork of Bitcoin trying to increase scalability and lower transaction fees increasing the blockchain block size, which achieves these features but reduces [decentralization](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f32dac47-a7a6-4e5d-af5b-28e4f1d87287).
13. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin younger brother, been around since 2011. It's based on the Bitcoin code but with some tweaks, lowering transaction speed and cost, many sees it as the ""silver"" of crypto since it's been around for so long.
14. **Chainlink (LINK):** between one Ganon and the other Link is also the official token of ChainLink, a network that basically bridges off-chain data with smart contracts: an example is Synthetix, a derivatives protocol that uses Chainlink to get the price feed of a certain asset on their smart contract.
15. **Solana (SOL):** one of the latest Ethereum contenders, launched in 2020 and offering possibly the highest layer-1 thoughput of all (50k transaction per second!), but is still somewhat centralized (although this is being addressed) and has yet to build a competitive ecosystem.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** it's a tokenized version of Bitcoin so it can be used on the Ethereum network and in DeFi applications.
17. **Polygon (MATIC):** the most popular layer-2 solution for Ethereum, Matic is the official coin of Polygon and used to pay fees on it: many Ethereum applications are moving there but it's still not easy to use with few exchanges supporting it directly.
18. **Ethereum Classic (ETC):** native token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain, a hard fork of Ethereum that claims to be more tied to Ethereum original plan. It has suffered various 51% attacks in the past years.
19. **Stellar (XLM):** created by an ex-Ripple founder, its aim is to become a currency and to allow to trade assets in a cheap and fast way. Last time I joked it was a 40c stablecoin, now I wished that held true.
20. **THETA (THETA):**  The token of THETA, a decentralized video delivery network (in a p2p fashion), used mainly for governance.
21. **DAI (DAI):** the biggest stablecoin not pegged 1-to-1 (or at least not claiming to) to the dollar, but soft-pegged and using cryptocurrencies deposited in smart contracts to collaterize the newly minted tokens.
22. **Internet Computer (ICP):** after its disastrous launch earlier this year, it almost overthrew Dogecoin as the biggest meme in the space. Jokes aside, it's a blockchain aiming to revolutionize the current internet, claiming to run at the same speed as the current web.
23. **VeChain (VET):**  Once everyone's favorite coin in this sub, was hit hard in the May crash and only lately recovering. Vechain is a blockchain focusing on business use-cases and supply chain management, VET (and VTHO) are the blockchain's official coins.
24. **Filecoin (FIL):**  the most popular IPFS (Interplentary File System), a peer-to-peer storage network without having to rely on cloud storage companies.
25. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron's founder Justin Sun is like Jian-Yang, great at repackaging other projects (thanks to u/fbslo on the last post). Jokes aside, it's a blockchain platform for decentralized applications more focused on content sharing and entertainment.
26. **Monero (XMR):**  Monero's goal is  to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, Monero obscures even senders and recipients whereas BTC doesn't. 
27. **Aave (AAVE):** a lending-borrowing decentralized protocol on Ethereum (and Polygon), the AAVE token grants discounted fees on the platform and act as a governance token.
28. **TERRA (LUNA):** Terra is a blockchain protocol offering a variety of applications, from stablecoins to synthetic assets and stocks. LUNA is the native token used to stabilize the price of UST (the TERRA stablecoin) and peg it to the dollar, and can be used to pay fees on the network.
29. **EOS (EOS):** another PoS blockchain launched in 2018, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It is designed to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology. 
30. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the native token of the Crypto.com chain and the Crypto.com exchange. Similar to the BNB token, it is closely tied to the success of the exchange.
31. **AMP (AMP):** it's an Ethereum token and it's used as collateral on the Flexa network, covering any financial transactions that fail if the need arises.
32. **Axie Infinity (AXS):** without a doubt the most popular blockchain game, a mix of Pokémon and Tamagotchi that follows the Play-To-Earn model. AXS is the token used for governance and soon staking.
33. **PancakeSwap (CAKE):** the most popular decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain, it started off as a copy of the Uniswap AMM model to then provide a variety of services.
34. **FTX Token (FTT):** the native token of the FTX platform, specialized in trading derivatives. It can be used as collateral or for discounts on trading fees.
35. **Bitcoin BEP2 (BTCB):** another tokenized version of Bitcoin, this time on the Binance Smart Chain.
36. **The Graph (GRT):**  It is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS like Filecoin. Basically simplyfing the retrieval of data on blockchains for developers and applications.
37. **Algorand (ALGO):** founded by the MIT professor Silvio Micali, it's a PoS blockchain supporting smart contracts, with low fees and high throughput of operations.
38. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):**  A utility token related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex. 
39. **Maker (MKR):** Maker is a token on the ethereum blockchain use for governance of the MakerDAO and Maker protocol, the organization behind the DAI stablecoin.
40. **Cosmos (ATOM):** dubbed the ""internet of blockchains"" by its founders, it solves the problem of interoperability between blockchains and provides tools to developers to build their own blockchains. Atom is the coin powering the platform and some notable projects built on top of it are Terra and Crypto.com chain.
41. **SHIBA INU (SHIB):** a meme coin that exploded in May, recently ShibaSwap was launched to give some sort of use-case to the coin which got a 3% score by DeFi Safety (later updated to 35%).
42. **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** a hard fork of a hard fork (BCH), it claims to be the true Satoshi Nakamoto vision of Bitcoin with an even bigger block size. Can't come up with a better joke than last time, I'm sorry.
43. **Tezos (XTZ):** another PoS Ethereum competitor. XTZ is the official coin used for governance and staking. One characteristic is that it is unforkable: it's impossible to create duplicates as instead happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum.
44. **Klaytn (KLAY):** a blockchain using a hybrid design between public and private chains, allowing anyone to create their own chain easily and without any technical knowledge, trying to appeal to companies and institutions mainly.
45. **NEO (NEO):**  *Noone can be told what it is, you'll have to see if for yourself.* Just kidding: launched in early 2014, it's a blockchain not too different from Ethereum where NEO is the coin used for governance. It has a Smart Economy System using digital assets (linked to a physical one) and verificable digital identities on smart contracts. 
46. **IOTA (MIOTA):**  open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things,  it uses a inventive blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same, with zero transactions fees and good scalability.
47. **Compound (COMP):** it's the governance token of Compound, a borrowing and lending platform not too different from Aave, launched in 2018 and with one of the biggest locked value of DeFi applications.
48. **TerraUSD (UST):** it's a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is available in different blockchains and it's getting more and more adoption, rising the price of Luna (which is directly tied to the demand for UST).
49. **Avalanche (AVAX):**  open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange. With an high throughput and good scalability, anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. 
50. **Theta Fuel (TFUEL):** it's another native token of the Theta blockchain, it acts as a gas token to power the operations on the blockchain and is used for payments to relayers (users sharing their computing power).

The thing that is puzzling about this trade is that the DAI is heavily backed by USDC so if USDC goes down it's probably taking DAI down with it. It's a really confusing trade but perhaps he is some sort of trading genius and knows something we don't.

TRX,cryptocurrency,"Now that we're in a bear market, is anyone actually still using your blockchain?","I love metrics. So I am constantly analysing data to compare and validate my theories on which blockchains and projects will survive and demonstrate the most upside potential. One metric, I look at often is the daily active users. It's a great metric to tell whether the chain is being used.

**What are Daily Active Users?**

This is simply the number of addresses on the blockchain that perform at least one transaction on a particular day. If there are 1000 addresses sending transaction, then that implies 1000 people used the blockchain.

**Why is it important?**

A blockchain will be successful if people are using it. That is an obvious assertion. If lots of people are making transactions, then the project has inherent utility. If its being effectively used during a bear market, then *there is potential for great upside during a bull run*.

**Why compare to the November highs?**

During the peak of the bullrun, we saw enormous take up and investment in crypto. Millions of new users creating their accounts, interacting with the blockchain, experimenting with dApps etc. It was sometimes difficult to find the data for the exact date, so all results were taken on or close to 10 November 2021, as this was the date of Bitcoin's all time high.

By comparing the current daily users to that date, we can ascertain a decent perspective on which users decided to stick around, or perhaps even which projects are still attracting new users, despite the bear market.

**What data could be missing?**

An obvious hole is that this shows the blockchain data only. Any transactions made on exchanges will not be counted towards the daily active users.

Another possible gap in the data comes from the impact of bots. Many blockchains have bots performing automated tasks, and these appear the same as any other user.

The date I chose was base don the Bitcoin price, and likely doesn't perfectly coincide with the all time highest daily active users on any particular chain - that could of course occur any day.

**Examples:**

The following is an examples are for Polkadot and Avalanche. I checked the published statistics on the [Polkadot](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=account) and [Avalanche](https://stats.avax.network/dashboard/overview/) websites, and then compared them to data on Messari and/or Glassnode. This is the same thing I did to complete the table below.

**Conclusion**

I will reserve judgement for now as to which projects show more or less potential for value increase based on their daily active users only. Suffice it to say, obviously for a project to become successful, adoption is key.

How does your project choice measure up? If you are concerned about your investments, check the numbers against several other sources. Messari would be another good place to start.

#The Elation  
For me, I kept talking to my good friend M about Bitcoin. He told me about it in September and through October to November we watched it sail past $10,000, to $15,000 before we decided to dip our toes. He was dead set on Ripple and bought at about $0.20, and was supposed to come over and show me how to set it up, but on his way over, he was T-boned by a careless driver and we postponed it. In the days after, Ripple shot up and I felt like I missed the boat, and he tipped me off about another good project called ""Cardano""  

*Oh, those merry times*  

I bought some in mid December, and let me tell you that what happened was absolutely insane. For starters, Coinbase was so fucked from the insane level of sign ups, that they couldn't process new accounts. It took **THREE WEEKS** for my account to be verified, and I had to buy Bitcoin from Local Bitcoins, transfer to Binance and then swap to Cardano. What a joke, but hey I got my Cardano. Little did we realise, we were just 1 month from the top. We enjoyed stratospheric gains for one month.  

It felt different than this February, where gains have been ridiculous. Back then, you could've put your money on nearly anything and 8-10x'd in a couple weeks flat. Someone on this reddit described it really well - your money doubled, then doubled again. You'd think ""Surely this is it"", then it doubled again. Finally, it doubled again. And then once more.  

I bought 2 days before the Bitcoin top. I had no idea what happens next.  

For the unaware, alts don't really go up when BTC goes up. Money flows out of alts, into BTC as it gains. When BTC dips, it takes the market with it. But BTC rising up doesn't really take the market up because there are so many who take money out of alts to ride BTC's wave. **The best time to be in alts, is when BTC goes flat**  

And that's kinda what happened. And alts exploded.  

My small Cardano buy doubled, and then doubled, and again and again. Every day I woke up to more green in the portfolio. My mate was making bank off Ripple - it went from 20c to over $3.00. I cursed myself for not just buying Ripple at 44c or whatever it was, and I bought some at $3.15 - basically the top of the market, Ripple's highest ever price.  

I also bought some bags. FunFair went mad, why not, I'll have some. Saw crazy profit on that. ETHLend going mad? Go on then. TRON? Go on then!  

There was no wrong decision in that frenzy.  

Until there was.  

#The Copium  
The gains leveled out. Some days started to get red. Everyone was saying shit like ""Chinese New Year"", ""Wall Street Bonuses"", ""Korea FUD"". Nobody can pin why the bubble popped, but in any assets history, such an incredible period of growth just cannot be sustained. I think it was South Korea basically taking some exchanges offline and it fucked with Coin Stat websites. People panicked and sold. That caused more panic, and more sales.  

The daily gains turned red, very quickly.  

""It's just a dip"" ""Hold!"" ""We need a correction"" was the hopium of the day. Anyone ballsy enough sold, probably everyone who had been in this space since 2016. They'd seen it all before.  

Some coins slowly turned from green, to breakeven, to red.  

And it just kept going down. I remember a brief rally in April. It was a suckers rally, in May my altcoins were mostly back in profit. It went down again. Same thing in August, BTC spiked up, we all thought ""Finally, this is it!"" and then it came back down again. Over and over.

Small blips aside, the Bitcoin bear market lasted from Mid December 2018 to Mid March 2020. That's 15 months, and only then did it start rising properly. We had a false start in early 2019 after the babyish chain split of Bitcoin Cash into BCH and BSV, which plummeted the market into one of the lowest prolonged periods of red I have seen. At this point, many people were down some -80% to -95%, me included.  

#The Effect  
How did it feel? Well to be honest, weird. But it happened over such a long period of time, you just become numb to it. In fact, after periods where your portfolio barely moves 3% in a week, you actually come to enjoy the wild volatility, even when the arse is falling out of it.  

It never stops though, in October 2018, we experienced one of the sharpest in memory, when a childish squabble between Roger Ver and Craig Wright forked the Bitcoin Cash chain into BCH and Bitcoin ""Satoshi's Vision"" (christ)  

This resulted in an absolutely gut-wrenching drop which lasted until early 2019.  

Some days, the losses and gains really did affect my day to day. I've received a couple warnings from work about chart-watching and I've been snappy or elated depending on how much I lost or gained in a day. Now I just truly don't care. I have a target and if I get there, good, if not, I'll wait.

#Is that a light I see?  
2019 started out quite nicely. Price remained stable in the $3,000's until April, where it all started climbing back up again. Alts came along for the ride too. On the summer solstice, BTC broke past $10,000. I smiled as I checked my portfolio, the same day I proposed to my gorgeous fiancee *(that covers my ass in case she reads this)*. Were things looking up?  

Myeh, not quite. This period of >$10,000 lasted until about September and we came back down. Again, a quiet Christmas and then the hope of a new year brought prices up again just nosing past $10,000.  

Up to this point, I had been buying a bunch of stuff. I bought some Golem, it tripled in one of those spikes in 2018 and then I held a worthless token. My ETHLend, Funfair and Tron were basically worthless. The only times I was in profit was when Cardano, Eth or Ripple stirred from their sleep.  

My first Bitcoin buy, to actually buy and keep, was in fuckin November 2019. I set up a monthly buy, but then stopped halfway through 2020 - with Coronavirus, I could've been out of work at a moments notice so all crypto buying stopped.  

In March 2020, we saw Crypto nosedive as Coronavirus struck. This one sucked. In hindsight, these prices were a **fucking steal** - I had the balls to put only one buy in, Cardano at $0.035 and $0.038 - last week, these appreciated 31x and 27x respectively.  

And that was basically the bottom. All has risen from there.  

I made some massive, massive mistakes. I held certain shitcoins way too long, and sold ETHLEND when I broke even on it, because I didn't do any research and didn't get why it was climbing so quickly, which ultimately cost me about $4,500 in wasted gains.

I think the best thing I did was consolidate my entire portfolio. All the shit from Coinbase Earn, I just moved it all into Stellar. All the other crap, I just tied it into the good projects and Bitcoin.  

So does this current dip feel like that bear market? No. It just feels like a correction on the way to something bigger. But I do think we will see, until June, some sideways and mostly negative price action broken up with a few days of gains at a time.  

Some cardinal rules for Crypto:  

* This market is fucking irrational. It doesn't make sense that EOS enjoyed periods of insane growth after the network was basically so congested it was not functional, or after people found out that 98% of the transactions on the network was just blocks filling up with weather data from around the world...  
* Do not ever, **ever** leverage yourself to buy Crypto. I'm talking loans, credit card debt, spending money reserved for rent or mortgage. This market can and will change in the blink of an eye and it's not worth the risk.  
* **Time in the market** is truly better than **timing the market**. I tried trading a handful of times and it was a fantastic way of basically just setting fire to my money. I think my most successful trade I earned about 20 ""free"" ADA. The worst trade I did, I lost about £50 before I figured fuck it.  
* Do some fucking research! I mentioned earlier, I sold ETHLEND before it transformed into AAVE. I sold at $0.12. At it's peak, it was worth about $5.40. It annoys me nearly every fucking day.  
* We are early. Yeah, we really are. Someone on here mentioned that most people can't even tell you what Bitcoin is or does. Get in, stay in. Ride until you can take out your principal and the rest is free money.  
* Don't take it so seriously. This shit definitely affected my day-to-day. You need to learn to let it go and roll with the punches. I put in a marginal amount maybe once a month and it still felt horrible the first few times I saw deep red in the portfolio.

TRX,cryptocurrency,The SEC vs Justin Sun (TRON) Explained,"The [SEC Has Charged](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-59) Justin Sun & related entities over ‘Fraud & Other Securities Law Violations’ - The SEC’s charges allege Tron’s Native Token, TRX, is a security.

* The SEC’s charges target Justin Sun and 3 of ‘his wholly-owned companies,’ Tron Foundation Limited, BitTorrent Foundation, and Rainberry, formerly BitTorrent.
* The SEC alleges TRX and the BitTorrent cryptocurrency BTT constituted unregistered offers and sales of ‘crypto asset securities.’ In addition, Sun and the entities were charged with ‘fraudulently manipulating the secondary market for TRX through extensive wash trading.’
* Charges were also brought due to an alleged ‘scheme to pay celebrities to tout TRX and BTT without disclosing their compensation.’ The SEC also brought charges against the celebrities involved in the scheme.

According to the SEC, Sun violated ‘antifraud and market manipulation provisions’ when he used wash trading to inflate TRX trading volume. Sun, on secondary markets ‘generated proceeds of (\~$31M) from illegal, unregistered offers and sales of the token.’ Following the charges, Sun [responded](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1638742625003130881) via Twitter that:

>""We believe the complaint lacks merit, and in the meantime will continue building the most decentralized financial system.""

Tron was launched in 2018, and despite the network achieving success on some fronts, such as [hosting](https://tether.to/en/transparency/) 55% of USDt tokens, the network has often been criticized for copying new crypto trends. For instance, the network’s algorithmic stablecoin USDD was seen as attempting to replicate the UST stablecoin on the Luna network. Tron itself is often [described](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/04/revolution-promised-by-trons-justin-sun-looks-like-clone-of-terras-algorithmic-stablecoin/) as a copy of Ethereum with limited changes.

TRX sold off as much as 12% following the SEC announcing the charges. The token currently has a market cap of USD 5.72B. In regards to US trading venues, TRX is not supported on Coinbase, but is offered on Kraken.

**Takeaway:** In many ways, Tron and TRX represent a relatively typical example of a cryptocurrency and associated network: TRX was launched via an ICO in 2017 which raised USD 70M; Tron is supported via the efforts of the Tron Foundation, other entities, and Sun; the Tron network claims to be decentralized and not dependent on any one group. In this context, the charges highlight the extent of regulatory and legal complexity faced by the crypto space.",21,2023-03-26 22:58:16,70

It's a shame how Justin is absolutely destroying the project.","On behalf of everyone born long ago enough to remember the struggles of taking 4 hours to download a song, sending an email through a CLI, to those with memories of yelling at their parents to get off the phone before being disconnected from Brood War, to those who have had the guilty pleasure of making a very flashy and pointless GeoCities webpage, and those who will forever have the ""You've got mail"" audio clip forever engrained in their memories, **thank you for all the being the first pioneers.**

To those who have been sued and fined ridiculous amounts of dollars, those who spent prison time for innovating, and to those who continue to fight for decentralization, **thank you.**

And on behalf of the seemingly few left in the world that actually cares about your past work, we sincerely apologize for the failure of Justin, Tron, and the ""new BTT team's"" utter disrespect and lack of care for the continued improvement of the BT protocol. This apology extends to the IPFS team as well. It just utterly blows my mind that a project literally forks every repo from a non-tokenized, open-source and non-profit organization, then continues to talk them down and give them shit because BTFS has ""more users.""

Since the acquisition of BitTorrent, Inc. (do not confuse this with the BitTorrent protocol):

* There have been zero protocol level improvements to BitTorrent clients nor uTorrent. I've spent countless hours reverse engineering BT/UT (BitTorrent / uTorrent) in search of  something, *anything.* But the deeper I looked, the sadder I got.
* The BT and UT clients have forcibly been closed source. Along with it, much of the original devs ongoing projects and plans were put to halt and presumably told to take down. If you look through GitHub and old forum posts, you'll see a lot of activity on BT/UT development, including user-submitted plugins and improvements. They all abruptly halted around 2018-2019, with Justin going as far as even removing some functionality that allowed for client enhancements.
* For a long time I was under the impression that the Tron/BTT team pioneered a way to allow P2P token transfers through torrent seeding, so I cut them a little slack for the lack of any activity on the BT/UT development end. Oh boy was I wrong. The BTT Speed bidding system was just BEP10 (Extension Protocol authored by Arvid Norberg of libtorrent in collaboration with UT). The BTTT team simply added a wallet on top of it, added it as a plugin on top of BT/UT, and pushed a WebUI with the most minimal, useless features that do not even record accurate data.
* BT/UT has been completely close-sourced, which I am sure they are regretting. It makes perfect sense why the BTT Speed wallet exchange has been down for 60 days now, after what was supposed to be a 2-hour maintenance. It's cause they didn't write the m'fkin protocol, and now the one or two devs working on BTT Speed are completely flabbergasted  which led to an emergency multiple job-listing posts days after they realized they were fucked.
* They forked almost every single IPFS repo's on GitHub (seriously, go check), implemented their minor changes, and now is the biggest shit talker on IPFS. You know what we called people doing shit like this back in the day? Script-kiddies.
* BTT is not some small project with big ambitions. It's a billion dollar market cap project. They raised $7.1mil through the ICO. And what do they have to show for it? Zero improvements in the clients (the community literally had to modify the client to unlock the 32-bit restriction as they are still stuck in 2012 and don't have a 64-bit version -- it'd take a day or two to release a 64-bit even if through LAA flag), a marketing team that posts cool images on Behance from time to time, a 24/7 twitter meme poster, and a bunch of forked codes. Where did the $7.1mil go? Definitely not development. Maybe a fancy office in SF? Or a fancy dinner with Warren Buffet? This is almost criminal.",3133,2021-07-15 13:03:37,502

As you can see, there's just under $100 million Tether now on the Tron blockchain. Oh and I'm pretty sure there were a bunch of Tether recently printed on the Ethereum blockchain in the last few days. Don't remember seeing those numbers so high.

&#x200B;

The Tether printing machine is in full force across three different blockchains. Combined with the exodus of funds from Bitfinex, this is going to get ugly really fast.

&#x200B;

Everyone suspected that there were problems with Tether, but have continually ignored it. Same thing happened with Gox. Everyone knew, but hell didn't break loose until it was official.

&#x200B;

Tether is so ingrained into the crypto ecosystem, do we have any idea of the ramifications?

I've heard a lot of negative options about Justin Sun and heard that sketchy things are happening with their stable coin, but just a few stats from defillama.

Tron has a TVL of 5.9B, 1.2M active users, and 44B in stablecoins, and 1M in fees over 24 hrs.

Seems like strong fundamentals, is this data being skewed? Most of these stats puts them as a front runner compared to other L1's (Algo, Cardano, Solana, Avax, etc). Basically everyone not Ethereum and BSC.

So is Tron an underrated L1 and ecosystem??",0,2023-07-30 03:38:08,45

Crazy to think this tweet is already over 2 years old and we're barely thawing out of the bear market but 2021 was the peak of the last bull run and a lot of crazy stuff was going down.   
Including random celebrities sponsoring a portfolio of crypto projects (mostly shitcoins) under the table and not disclosing that their tweets or videos were ads if they have gotten paid to promote.   
The Lindsay Lohan tweet was a pretty obvious paid shill post paid by non other than Justin Scammy Sun himself

 Defi expert Lindsay Lohan did settle with the SEC later on with a slap on the wrist for ""illegally promoting TRX and BTT crypto assets without disclosing that they were compensated for doing so and the amount of their compensation""  
The SEC will also accuse Justin Sun with orchestrating a promotional campaign in which he and his celebrity promoters hid the fact that the celebrities were paid for their tweet.   
This is a nice start but not much of a punishment for these two, hopefully by the next full bull run we will be seeing a lot less of these B rated celebrities talking about their ""thoughts"" on crypto.",17,2023-03-31 22:43:36,52

TRX,cryptocurrency,Tron and BSC are here to stay,"The truth is that both Tron and Binance Smart Chain have no point being relevant blockchains. They are both relatively centralized blockchains that do not have great tech. What they do have is a large user base.

**Tron is the USDT transfer chain**

Tron had a large number of users. Most users are not using defi, games, or other dapps on Tron. Tron has native USDT and it is the preferred transfer method of USDT for many many people in Asia. The thing is that it is cheaper than Ethereum to transfer USDT, but it is often $0.40 to $0.80 for a simple transfer. This can be done for a comparable cost on a L2 like Arbitrum One or much cheaper on many other chains.

**Binance Smart Chain is the home of people trying to get rich quick**

Binance at one time was one of the cheapest smart contract blockchains out there. It was much less expensive than Ethereum and it was very easy to transfer funds from the largest exchange in the world, Binance.

There are a ton of projects on the chain that are get-rich-quick schemes, shitty games, memes, and just about anything else you can think of to separate a human from their money. So many people going to BSC to “get filthy rich” are not crypto-literate and fall for scams left and right.

The thing is, the low gas fees plus the “promises of getting filthy rich” coupled with human greed mean that BSC is here to stay.

TRX,cryptocurrency,An idea for a book: A man with the ability to travel via crypto on the blockchain. Think ‘Jumper’ meets ‘Tron’.,"I like to juggle rough ideas of potential books, and was thinking about the connectivity of blockchain and crypto, with how diverse it is. 

It’s present in so many countries: western, eastern, developing or otherwise, and used in a variety of different ways. I think it would be interesting to explore exactly how crypto is helping people connect with one another, and how the global footprint of crypto is developing so quickly. 

Basic premise, main character is able to travel via the blockchain, whilst doing so imagine *web 3.0* elements of wacky worlds and new experiences. But he can exit at another place in the real world too, so long as it’s a drive or wallet utilising blockchain. 

For conflict, I’m thinking of governments outlawing crypto, and watching the world from within crumble and the connections to those outside be severed. 

I know people might exclaim, concerned with why I would share ideas publicly. But the reality is I haven’t the time to complete them; I’ve never finished a book, but I’ve started plenty. It’s an infuriating process and I respect any author, one day I’ll finish one!

***The full blog post with all the tables is*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28)***.***

Welcome all to the monthly report for my homemade 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Funds. This group contains **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, XLM, USDT, LTC, BSV**, and **Tron.** 

\---> **YOU GET A MOON AND YOU GET A MOON**: actually, just one of you. *42 Moons to the first person to name the artist and title of the hidden song in this post. Why 42?  To encourage Special Membership: that's worth about $5 (42\*.12) at the moment, enough to treat yourself to a month of* [*r/CryptoCurrency*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) *special membership!* If you've already won this month, give it to someone else, por favor.

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for over 3+ years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, and 2021. ***Learn more about the history, rules, and FAQs of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **April Winners and Losers** \- **XRP** wins by a ton, **BTC** loses first month ever.
* **Overall since Jan. 2019** \- **ETH** flipped **BTC** this month and is now in the lead. *Both are up quadruple digits since Jan. 2019!* Top Ten portfolio up +653% (vs. S&P's +67%), all coins in the green. **EOS** worst performing, but still up +147% (over double ROI of S&P).
* **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 513%.**

## Month Twenty Eight – UP 653%  

[2019 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio Summary](https://preview.redd.it/brdkzaznf9z61.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=21d9296a3829085ffed48ac37c997215332058c1)

The 2019 Top Ten Portfolio followed a strong [March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-26) with an even stronger April: it gained about 175% this month.  Only one crypto finished in the red (**Bitcoin)** and **XRP** easily outperformed its peers.  This portfolio continues to be the second best performing of the four, trailing the first place [2020 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16) by 300%.

## April Movement Report, Ranking, and Dropouts

Here are the ups and downs this month for the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio:

Ups:

* **XRP** – up three places (#7→#4)
* **Bitcoin Cash** – up four places (#14→#10) and back in the Top Ten
* **BSV** – up one place (#29→#28)

Downs:

* **EOS** – down two places (#24→#26)
* **Litecoin** – down two places (#9→11)  
* **Tether** – down one place (#4→#5)

&#x200B;

[ 2019 Top Ten Rank - 50&#37; out of the Top Ten ](https://preview.redd.it/q0dvbpasf9z61.png?width=289&format=png&auto=webp&s=c45f36d0ddf57b3c0beb3d9dda2e93ddff7399e4)

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2019:** After twenty-eight months of the 2019 Top Ten Experiment 50% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out.  **EOS**, **Litecoin, BSV, Stellar,** and **Tron** have been replaced by **Binance Coin, Doge, Cardano, UNI,** and **Polkadot.**

**BSV** and **EOS** are the only 2019 Top Ten cryptos that have dropped out of the Top *Twenty*. 

## April Winners and Losers 

***April Winners*** – It wasn’t really close this month: **XRP** easily outpaced its peers, up +172l.   **Bitcoin Cash** finished in second place in April, up +72%. 

***April Losers*** –  Here’s something you don’t see everyday: **Bitcoin** had the worst performance of the month.  Since all other cryptos were well in the green, **Tether** is the second worst performer of April.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

Which crypto holds the most wins or losses over the life of the project?  Here’s a snapshot of the winners and losers over the first twenty-eight months of the 2019 Top Ten Experiment:

&#x200B;

[ 2019 Top Ten Ws and Ls ](https://preview.redd.it/zxowm2wvf9z61.png?width=297&format=png&auto=webp&s=05894cb5a921a6fc25fb3494f8b67313ab2eb329)

**Tether** still has the greatest number of monthly victories (7) followed by **BTC** with five. This tells us 25% of the time (i.e. seven times out of twenty eight months) every crypto in the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio has finished the month in the red (although many of **UST’s** victories happened in 2019).

April marks the first time that **BTC** has finished a month at the bottom of any of the [four Top Ten Portfolios](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). This makes **EOS** the only crypto without a monthly loss in the 2019 Top Ten Experiment.

## Overall Update – BTC gives up lead to ETH, all cryptos well in the green, EOS worst performing

April saw **Bitcoin’s** lead evaporate completely.  **Ethereum** not only caught **BTC** this month, but established a substantial +600% lead.  

And that $100 investment into first place **ETH** on [January 1st, 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/)?  It’s currently worth $2,190.

After twenty eight months 100% of the cryptos in the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio are either flat or in positive territory. Not counting stablecoin **Tether**, the worst performing crypto is **EOS**, which is still up +147% in a little over two years.  Compare that to the ROI of the S&P (see below).

Although the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is up +653%, April saw it fall even further behind the Experiment’s top performing Portfolio, the 2020 Top Ten’s massive [\+952% gain](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16).

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

[ Total Market cap +1638&#37; since Jan 2019 ](https://preview.redd.it/f9w1g0e6g9z61.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=25dab2e01c58d068a56321ce6d40eff17e7ed01e)

Although the Top Ten Portfolios are starting to generate a nice ROI, it’s nothing compared to the overall market cap.  If you were able to somehow capture the entire cryptocurrency sector since [January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/), your ROI would be +1638%.  That’s still a bit behind first place **ETH**, but much better than the rest of the cryptos and much better than the Top Ten approach.

After reaching the $1T milestone in February, we’re at $2T just a few months later.  We also have a nice seven month streak of month-ending total market cap record highs going.

## Bitcoin Dominance:

[BitDom at a 2019 Top Ten Experiment Low](https://preview.redd.it/ta851489g9z61.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bc5846a1e8ce3623285cf0fa70d3ddbaf74af7e)

**BitDom** plummeted in April and is now at the lowest point in the history of the 2019 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment.  For context, the table above shows the progression over the last twenty eight months with **BTC** domination ranging between 48%-70%.  

For what happened last time **Bitcoin Dominance** fell into the low 40s and 30s, check out the [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-40).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2019:

[ 2019 Top Ten Portfolio ROI ](https://preview.redd.it/ednkm73eg9z61.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8665a0fa4c54848e3c25121d7064fa353032ea6)

The 2019 Top Ten Cryptos Portfolio gained almost $1800 in April.  After twenty-eight months the value of the initial $1000 investment is **$7,527**, up +653%. That makes six straight months of record returns for the 2019 Portfolio.

Here’s a table summarizing the monthly ROI over the life of the 2019 Top Ten Index Fund experiment, which provides a pretty good sense of the journey to this point:

[ 2019 Top Ten ROI Summary ](https://preview.redd.it/00hz2syfg9z61.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&s=30db892f73f182a6a598ad8e34e69c183b675cb4)

Mostly green, but still with its share of significant dips.  For example, a little over [one year ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-15/) the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio was up only +6%. 

At +653%, the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is the second best performing [out of the four Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).  First place is the [2020 group](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16), which has pulled well ahead of the pack, now up +952%.  

Over the years, it’s been back and forth between the 2019 and 2020 Top Ten Portfolios, but the last couple months have seen the 2020 Top Ten pull farther and farther ahead: it is now holding an almost 300 percentage point lead over the second place 2019 Portfolio.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Speaking of other Top Ten Portfolios, let’s put them all together now:

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-40): up +56% (total value $1,556)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): up +653% (total value $7,527)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16): up +952% (total value $10,522)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-4): up +393% (total value $4,927)

Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$24,532** ($1,556 + $7,527 + $10,522 + $4,927).

**That’s up +513%** on the combined portfolios, another record high for the Top Ten Index Fund Experiment project.

Here’s a table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

[ Combined ROI of all four Experiments ](https://preview.redd.it/hqwluvwjg9z61.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&s=df09520fc213b1b9feeb14c654ad332da8a299d2)

In summary: ***That’s an +513% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st for four straight years***.

## Top Ten Index vs. Top Five Index

Inspired by a suggestion from one of our blog readers, let’s take a look at how the 2019 Top Ten approach would compare to a hypothetical Top Five Index.

A Top Five 2019 Index would mean investing $200 into **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH,** and **EOS.**

[ An alternate reality: what if it had been the Top Five? ](https://preview.redd.it/yxeui0dmg9z61.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c2d35b748d260eafd723850bfaa48963a3bde48)

After twenty eight months, a Top Five Index would be worth **$10,077**, returning **908%**. That’s compared to the **$7,527** (**+653%**) of the 2019 Top Ten. 

So at this point in the 2019 Experiment, going with the five largest caps at the time would have been the better approach, by far.   

Alright, that’s crypto.  How does crypto compare to the stock market?

## Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with traditional markets.  Another month, another all time high for the S&P.

Since the S&P 500 Index is up 67% since January 2019, the initial $1k investment I put into crypto a little over two years ago would be worth $1,670 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 in January 2019. 

Even though an extremely solid return for traditional markets, that +67% return is nearly *six hundred percentage points behind* the return of the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio over the same time period.

But what if I took the same world’s-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging $1,000-per-year-on-January-1st-Crypto-Index-Fund-Experiment approach with the S&P 500? It would yield the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1564 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1670 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1290 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1110 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $5,634** ($1,564 + $1,670 + $1,290 + $1,110)

That is up **+41%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+513%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of 472% ***in favor of crypto.***

Here’s a table providing an overview of the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P:

[ Crypto vs. S&P: crypto far ahead](https://preview.redd.it/b9s070stg9z61.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=668119a0e97044f6d80a15cc0f649d6e7730cd26)

The 472% difference is by far the largest gap since I began tracking this metric in early 2020, even with stocks at all time highs.

## Conclusion:

With **Bitcoin** first monthly loss and **BitDom** at a 2019 Top Ten Experiment low, it’s starting to feel a bit [dangerous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8b4xYbEugo).  Will the crypto market go through the same **BTC** run up, altcoin run up, total market crash as 2017/2018 or is this time different?

To both old-timers and newcomers: thanks so much for taking the time to read and for supporting the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments. I hope you find the updates helpful in terms of perspective as you navigate this strange and exciting crypto landscape. 

Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects tracking the Top Ten cryptos as of [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-40) (the OG experiment), [January 1st, 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16), and most recently, [January 1st, 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-4).

The intention is to not spread more FUD (like we need it right?), but please be aware. 

This recent crash (no, its not a dip; lets call it what it is at this point) has many investors and traders scared to put money into the market. We have seen some of the altcoins get rekt pretty hard.  40-70% loss on the weekly is not uncommon for even top 50 and those are surely supposed to be ""good & solid"" projects right? Well...think again. 

With the potential upcomming bear market I would like to remind everyone that most alts that are now top 100 might not make it. This time the hype is around staking rewards, DeFi APY pools, NTF's and meme coins. The main focus of 2018 were ICO's. It changes drastically each cycle. As someone who witnessed my portfolio outperform BTC in 2017, only to lose both sats and fiat value by 90% in the early 2018, I would like to inform the new people how things work with altcoins. BTC's dominance is rising again - hinting at the end of altseason.

Consider the following to be true:

1.) It does not matter if the team is good.  
2.) It does not matter if the idea is revolutionary.  
3.) It does not matter that there is a real life usecase for the coin/token.

I see some newcommers on this sub already coming to terms with the fact that it might be over and sayin ""ill just hold my alt picks for the longterm, I believe in the project"".... Now, yes, some will be good in the longterm... **But most will not.** Even if we go sideways for a few months and then have another leg up in the summer due to good news, institutions buying more, and major platforms(mainly big three ETH, ADA, DOT) with big updates, A LOT of coins will not be there.

I suspect many will never reach their ATH's again. Remember, most of the coins I will mention below were in the top 100 at some point during the 2017-2018 bullrun, perhaps briefly, perhaps for months.

So....

A lookback at some of the coins that were shilled and hyped heavily on the way down from the 2018 peak and never got back to ATH's:

[Iota](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/)

*Price facts:*

It peaked at $5 in december 2017, and bottomed at \~$1 just a few months later in april 2018. Thats an 80% loss. Then it went on to reach a low of as much as $0.1 in the following years. **A loss of 98% from ATH.**

I was buying this at 2.3 and 4.2 all the way up back in 2017, waiting for my guaranteed 10x. Finally got rid of it at 1.7 this year.It never got back to its ATH - peaking just slightly above 2.53 this run.

*The hype surrounding it:*

Reading about it, you could hear stuff like ""Blockchain 3.0"", and ""the bigger the userbase the faster and more secure the network"", and ""the currency of the future"", ""it will connect all machines on the internet, making them exchange good in IoTa currency"", ""the team is smart and hard-working"" ""a very well designed projects"" ""will revolutionalize the way smart cars, refrigiratos and phones communicate with each other"".

[Request (REQ)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/request/) (frequently hyped and shilled on this sub like VET and LTO today)

*Price facts:*

Had a massive run in extremely short time. This one hit like few others. Was just under 10 cents in december 2017, then it just 10x-ed in a month or so to just uner a dollar, peaking in January. It was free money. Until it one day just wasnt. By april it was trading at 14 cents again. **Now its dead.**  Gone from top 100 for probably forever, forgotten by most. Went under a cent in 2019 (-99.4% from ATH) and came back this year to around 15 cents again. Still like 83% away from ATH.

*The hype surrounding it:*

Didnt really read into it much back then. It was the one that got away and I never got into it. Something something about revolutionazing the paymant industry, putting it on the blockchain. Having an universal storage of transactions. I am talking credit cards, cashback, decentralised and publically viewed on the blockchain and becoming transparent. HUGE. It was all the rage and the cryptospace, especially YTB was losing its mind over it, this sub not beeing immune. I am talking  VET and LTO level shilling.

&#x200B;

[Substratum (SUB)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/substratum/)

*Price facts:*

Picture this: Its 30th of December 2017 and you are preparing for new years eve party. You finally dump 2.5k into Substratum after researching it for a week or so, already feeling massive FOMO for missing the price surge from 40 cents to $1. You get 2,517 of them. In 9 days I was sitting on 7.5k, about 5k in pure profits feeling on top of the world. It 3x-ed in 10 days. Why sell? Shit is going to $10 for sure.

....

This one, I still to this day hold. BAGGGS of it. It was delisted on Binance, where my worthless bag resides. I cant do shit with it. It is now trading at 0.004 on an exchange no1 knows about and has no volume. That is a 99.8% price drop from ATH.

*The hype surrounding it:*

My friend pitched it to me saying it will make internet use fair. It was supposed to make search engines fair and it was supposed to do that by decentralising them. HUGE project, solid team. Shilled heavily on YouTube mostly. Exit scam.

&#x200B;

[QuantStamp (QSP)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/quantstamp/)

*Price facts:*

After 7x-ing its value(from 9 cents to 73 cents) in 2 weeks or less, it went all the way back down to 20 cents before dead-cat-bouncing slightly above 35 again. Then died quite quickly (to like 0.006) with 99.1% loss in the upcomming bear. Got a bump to 10 cents this bullrun.

*The hype surrounding it:*

The first mover advantage into Smart Contact Security. Top notch tech for securing the ETH blockchain, even getting mentions from Vitalik. Huge partnerships, hard working team, and a product we surely need, right? RIGHT??

&#x200B;

[Lisk (LSK)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lisk/) This one was really dear to my heart. I even got my dad into it.

*Price facts:*

It initially lost 76% during the great crash of 2018, and the went on to rebounce somewhat, finally bottomed around %0.7 (a 97% crash) in 2020. This run it never got past $10, I got out at around $8.3 after holding for years.

*The hype surrounding it:*

It was massive. It was aiming to be the biggest blockchain ecosystem around in the years to come, with a pro team and a long roadmap, and you were really early if you buying at $17( I was). 

There was a rumour going around that ALL apps, on ALL playstores, be it android or iPhone would be written on and connected throught Lisk. It was like the main blockchain for mobile app industry. They had events, AMA's, hard working team, a product that the world surely will need. They will be the first in the space. 

The blockchain has also been around since before the bullrun, and that was somehow supposed to prove these guys are legit.  It was stable it was secure it was the future. 

&#x200B;

[Icon(ICX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/icon/)

*Price facts:*

Crashed from $12 to $3 when everything else was crashing. I bought this one on the way down actually. I let it go at $2.3 this year(almost perfect peak, yay me) after holding all throughout the bear. Bottomed at -95%+ at some point.  

*The hype surrounding it:*

Throwing around big words that noone really understood or took the time to explain such as ""aggregator"", ""interoperability"", ""layering"" and the bunch. It was supposed to connect the one bussines group with another though its network in an effective and decentralised way. Had actually shools and governments as partners. Also Samsung got involved later I think.

&#x200B;

[Power Ledger (POWR)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/power-ledger/) 

*Price facts:*

It was worth like $1.6 at some point, I remember getting into it at 70 cents. Held it all the way through initial crash of like 80+% to 2021, when I let it go for like $38. Peaked at $0.64 this run.

*The hype surrounding it:*

This project was supposed to revolutionalize the energy and electric distribution globally, making it trackable on blockchain, and sending it where there is shortage. Sustainable energy for all. Connected globally. No1 of us though why we need a crypto token to implement this change and why would any big energy firm need a token to implement this change though. It just sounded sooooo coool. 

&#x200B;

[PIVX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pivx/)

*Price facts:*

Crashed from like $13 to $2 (around 80%) in a month or less. Bottomed at sub 25 cents (a 98% loss from ATH ) in 2020. Never came back, but had a bump back to $2 this run. 

*The hype surrounding it:*

Simply put, it was ""the Monero killer"". Almost no fees, even more secure, more anonymous, cutting edge tech, privacy for days. The future of privacy coins. Masternodes. Proof of stake. Top tech. Buy buy buy. 

&#x200B;

[NEO (or ""Antshares"" back then).](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/)

*Price facts:*

This beast literally 200x-ed. If you got into it before rebranding, when it was still Antshares you were lucky. It almost reached $200 from sub $1. Crashed hard after China FUD was released(yes China FUD was a thing back then also). From January 15 to April 4th, a loss of 74%. ALMOST came back to ATH this bullrun. It never broke into top 25 I dont think, even though it was firmly in the top 10 for quite some time in 2017. I hodled like 42 of them all these yeas, finally letting it go at $50 this year. I lost like half my money on it.

*The hype surrounding it:*

It was advertised as the Chinese Ethereum killer. Better tech.Better implementations of smart contracts. Harder working team. The fact that is was (somewhat) centralized didnt bother much people. Earning GAS for just holding it was a big deal back then (staking rewards were not really a thing, you see). It was one of the only projects giving passive income. Also a lot of projects were starting on it. 

&#x200B;

[DeepBrainChain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/deepbrain-chain/)

*Price facts:*

Would you like to 6x your money in 10 days?? All you had to do was buy this shitcoin at new year 2018 and sell it at the peak on 9th January 2018. Now trading at around one cent, down 98% from ATH.

*The hype surrounding it:*

An integration of AI and blockchain technology. A revolution in the AI industry. Not anonymous team. Good partnerships, huge offices, dedication, integrity, vision, exelent crowdfunding. The future is ours.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**THERE's A LOT MORE.** These are the ones I and my friends remember.

 Hold on to your sats guys.

&#x200B;

**Which projects/coins/tokens do I think will not make it??**

1.) ***The majority of the food shitcoins on Binance Smart Chain*** ...

will just die. I mean, can you imagine buying CAKE, BAKE or BURGER  after what happened last week?? Of course the dog coins and scams on BSC will die also. If/when ETH fixes fee's, Cardano does smart contracts and Polkadot kicks off parachains, there will be less and less need for BNB in the space, and even though the token might(probably will) stay a top 10 for years to come, the BSC ecosystem will surely lose its significance in the crypto space.

2.) ***Memes.***

Everyone loves hype, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter shilling, and dumb money flows into this. But with the recent crash, dumb money is now scared shitless. Yes DOGE might come around again in the next run as the king of memes, but I dont see that hapenning to coins with ""safe"", ""dog"" ""mars"" ""elon"" ""moon"" ""cum"" ""pussy"" in their name. Its just not happening.

3.) ***Smart contract platforms and Ethereum competitors.***

Dont get me wrong I do believe in multichain world. I think some can coexist. SOME. Not all. I believe Ethereum, Cardano and Polkadot are here to stay. They have solid tech, they have hardworking teams and have been around for years now. I also think Cosmos(ATOM) is undervalued and is all tech no hype this run, and thus, didnt get to shine in the spotlight, but can potentially play a big role in the years to come. I am not so sure about Solana, Avalanche, Tezos, Tron, Eos, Icon, Neo, Algorand, Elrond, Nem, Hedera HashGraph, ... etc

I know many of you like these projects. I, too, like some of them. Ask yourself, is there really a space for them in crypto in 3 -10 years??

***4.) Coins that are trying to be ""the next"" \_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the blank) and forks that are trying to improve on an existing coin.***

There are countless(actually I think 105) forks of BTC that are now mostly ghost chains. Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, BitcoinX, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision; even Bitcoin Cash Satoshi Vision and ... Bitcoin this and Bitcoin that.  Do you have any idea how fast EthereumClassic(ETC) will die?? Probably even BCH (bcash) and LTC(litecoin) will not make it. For sure others didnt.

Yes Litecoin is objectively better tech(and dear to my heart) than Bitcoin. It does not matter though.

&#x200B;

***tl;dr: Dont get in love with, or marry you baggs.***

TRX,cryptocurrency,Accidentally transferred ETH instead of ETHOLD token to my Poloniex account via Tron network,"Hi, as the title states, I accidentally transferred ETH instead of ETHOLD to my Poloniex account. ETH is the newer token that's supposed to replace ETHOLD. Both are TRON tokens, however Poloniex no longer supports deposit/withdraw of ETH via the TRON network. I used the same TRON address for this erroneous transfer as I have done previously with my ETHOLD transfers to Poloniex.

I already reached out to Poloniex and am waiting for a response. I know I can't expect much in these types of situations, but does anyone have experience getting their tokens back in situations like this?

The reason I ask this question is the top 100 was nothing like it was today. I remember him talking about Ripple like it was the next big play, but now no one talks about it.

My question is more directed to coins that had an immense amount of hype behind it and now you rarely hear about it or simply it became a failed project.

TRX,cryptocurrency,so i got bored (and drunk) and decided to play around with seed phrase scammers (with pics)....,"lol jesus, would this even count as a proper thread for CC? ok i hope so, so here we go. 

so while ive been chasing the recent BTC/ETH rally during this big bear, i got stressed out and decided to hit the bottle again and take a small break. and i get a message on Twitter from a scammer giving out their 12 word seed phrase because ""they need help getting USDT out their wallet"":

https://imgur.com/a/pcroe5P

""whatever"", i said. typical honeypot scammer shit. if you follow crypto-related shit on twitter, expect to be messaged by scumbags.


then i see this thread posted today:
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/w4qy1n/scammer_sent_me_a_seed_phrase_with_1k_usdt_trc20/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

a fellow redditor gets a set of 12 word seeds from twitter.  

and then it clicked to me. you have scumbags on twitter giving away seeds.....

....and you have scumbags in reddit DM's asking for seeds:

https://imgur.com/a/gq7iW6u


so heres an idea:💡how about i give one scumbag another scumbags seeds! 🤣


so i post a bait thread on the trustwallet  sub, since that twitter message mentions trustwallet (sorry trustwallet staff, but this is for the greater good): 

https://imgur.com/a/5VmEgmy


aaaaaand right on cue, here comes cockroaches. heres a couple of many messages, there all the same pitch, all the same shit: 

https://imgur.com/a/nreCFay

oh i posted on the ledger sub too, but i deleted that, i dont want them getting mad at me because, well, i love my Ledger Nano X. 

anyway, so all those links are the same. all trying hard to to look legit, all asking for your 12-24 words. 

sometimes they will even ask you to chat with ""customer service"":

SO HERE WE GO, HERES ""MY"" SEEDS 😂🤣😂🤣😂:

so as i sip my beers and hand out honeypot seeds to desperate scumbags, the fellow redditor in that thread messages me those seeds. turns out theyre the same as the ones i got 😂


https://imgur.com/a/RobiYaa


and the response from some of these scammers? mostly they just stop responding. but a couple were mad enough to block me i guess

https://imgur.com/a/etl3SP4


ah good times!

conclusion: seed phrase askers getting fucked by seed phrase givers. only in scammer world is this possible.


UPDATE:

this is what the wallet looks like when you import the seed. of course i left a reminder not to deposit into it. also here is the latest transfer. money go in aaand money go straight out!:

and here is the recent activity. seems alot of idiots are throwing tron at it to get the usdt out. 🤣

‼️EDIT EDIT: MOST RECENT KILL! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 literally just happened a few minutes ago! 🤣🤣🤣. douchebag messages me the usual shit, sends link, i put in the scam phrase. he sends 15TRX trying to get the USDT and it immediately gets pulled out. then he sends ANOTHER 14TRX and once again, loses it! 😁🤣

---------------------

EDIT EDIT EDIT: let this be a reminder, that you should NEVER hand out your own personal seeds! do not answer DM's and stay safe folks. and of course I WILL NEVER ASK FOR YOUR FUCKING SEEDS. 

but i will tell you this: HAMMER SEEDS ONTO METAL. 

also..Ledger Nano X is the best.

TRX,cryptocurrency,Crypto will never reach mass adoption if it does not become more user friendly,"Is  it so difficult for crypto developers to create a UI or anything that would make crypto easier/ more accessible to people.

I am more than 2 years into crypto, but navigating crypto is still difficult even for me:

- every transaction is a thrill: Long human-unreadable address, prone for errors, set up gas fee on your own, slow transaction speed

- if your transaction got stuck (ETH), only the more experienced crypto users know how to cancel the transaction

- bridging one coin/token to another chain can be confusing

- blindly approving MetaMask prompts can make you approve malicious smart contracts you're not aware of

- revoking smart contracts, most people aren't even aware of this

- cold, hot, paper wallets...people don't even understand what a wallet is...custodial wallets are way easier, so too many people fall for it and don't do self-custody

- coin VS token, so many people don't even understand the difference

- tokens on several chains for example USDT on ETH, on TRON, on BSC, ...some people who just want to send stablecoins to friends and family are confused how to send their funds

- confusing crypto ticker names that looks quite similar

TRX,cryptocurrency,Accidentally transferred ETH instead of ETHOLD token to my Poloniex account via Tron network,"Hi, as the title states, I accidentally transferred ETH instead of ETHOLD to my Poloniex account. ETH is the newer token that's supposed to replace ETHOLD. Both are TRON tokens, however Poloniex no longer supports deposit/withdraw of ETH via the TRON network. I used the same TRON address for this erroneous transfer as I have done previously with my ETHOLD transfers to Poloniex.

I already reached out to Poloniex and am waiting for a response. I know I can't expect much in these types of situations, but does anyone have experience getting their tokens back in situations like this?

TIA.

It was founded by Justin ~~Sun~~ Scam who has a lot of issues we don't really need to hash out right exactly now in this post.

***The full blog post with all the tables is*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-33)***.***

Welcome! This is the monthly report for my homemade 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund. This group contains **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, XLM, USDT, LTC, BSV**, and **Tron.**

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for over 3.5 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, and 2021. ***Learn more about the history, rules, and FAQs of the Experiments (including the answer to the ""WHY TETHER?!?!"" question)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **OCT Winners and Losers** \- **ETH** wins the month, **XRP** worst performer.
* **Overall since Jan. 2019** \- **ETH** holds a commanding lead, up over 3,000% since the beginning of the 2019 Experiment. 2019 Top Ten Portfolio up +658, an ATH. 
* **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +514%.**

## Month Thirty-Four – UP 658%  

https://preview.redd.it/rqt0cquh4dz71.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=57d414c8b371bf0921c20ba6b16439f31a106df2

The 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, Stellar, USDT, Litecoin, BSV,** and **Tron**.  

October highlights for the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio: 

* The portfolio followed an [all red September](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-33) with an all green October. 
* **ETH** best performer of the month.
* **Ethereum** in the overall lead, up +3,077% since January 2019.

## October Ranking and Dropout Report

Here’s the difference in rank since January 2018:

https://preview.redd.it/yfnrdwti4dz71.png?width=411&format=png&auto=webp&s=a887485c44697e242165efc16820a703bf99458b

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2019:** After thirty-four months, 60% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten in January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/)  have been knocked out.  **EOS**, **Litecoin, BSV, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash,** and **Tron** have been replaced by **Binance Coin, Cardano**, **DOT, SOL**, **Doge**, and **SHIB.**   

**BSV** has fallen the furthest so far (#56) – it is the only crypto that has dropped out of the Top *Fifty*. 

## October Winners and Losers 

***October Winners*** – **ETH**, up +32%, followed by **BTC** \+28%. 

***October Losers*** –  Beside **USDT**, **XRP** (+7%) was the worst performing crypto of the 2019 group.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

Which crypto holds the most wins or losses over the life of the project?  Here’s a snapshot of the winners and losers over the first thirty-four months of the 2019 Top Ten Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/6bxabntj4dz71.png?width=412&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3340eb30b130dd6cbb28a2b1b377748d45c7993

By a large margin, **Tether** has the greatest number of monthly victories (10) followed by **BTC** and **ETH** with five.  

Every crypto has won at least one month since [January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/) and **BSV** and **USDT** have the most losses, 11 out of 34 months.

## Overall Update –  ETH alone in first place, all cryptos in positive territory, BSV and EOS worst performing

**ETH** (+3,077%) is easily the best performer of this group, doubling up the ROI of second place **BTC** (+1,531%) over the same period of time.

**The $100 investment into first place ETH on** [**January 1st, 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/) **is currently worth $3,260.**

After thirty-four months, 100% of the cryptos in the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio are in positive territory. Not counting stablecoin **Tether**, the worst performing crypto is **BSV** and **EOS**, still up +75% and  +79% respectively.   

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/axqbn86l4dz71.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b8c27be07e9eeab20368f24c6901b170aa6c383

The total crypto market gained over a half a trillion USD in October and is now at an all time monthly closing high of $2.6T

The entire cryptocurrency sector is up +1990% since [January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/).  This is still well behind first place **ETH** (3,077%) but much better than the rest of the Top Ten cryptos, including second place **Bitcoin** (+1531%).  And the total market is performing much better than the Top Ten approach (+1990%).

Translation: unless you went all in on **ETH** thirty-four months ago, you were better off diversifying. 

And the Top Ten approach has beaten every individual crypto except **BTC** and **ETH**.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.6T** [**this month**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34).

## Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/xuo3ipfm4dz71.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad2542468cfde8ab1cdbe08ef2c88f819521953b

**BitDom** inched up in October, ending the month at 43.7% (compared to 43.2% in September).  This is the low end of the range when looking at the timeframe as a whole.  For context, here are the high and low points of **BTC** domination over the life of the 2019 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**41.9% in May 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-29).

High Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-eight/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2019:

https://preview.redd.it/pgnh9dan4dz71.png?width=339&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7507e55e5ef8a0b307025a8dcad1a6e76c5bb35

The 2019 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio gained $1,482 in October. Nuts when you consider the initial investment was only $1,000!  After thirty-four months the value of the initial $1000 investment is **$7,580**, up +658%.  **This is an ALL TIME HIGH** for the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio. 

Below is a table summarizing the monthly ROI over the life of the 2019 Top Ten Index Fund experiments, providing a pretty good sense of the journey up to this point:

https://preview.redd.it/wdgbwiso4dz71.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4b3543f496fdb2c9288c104f2a2b11d355f3bc5

Fairly steady upward movements punctuated by massive dips.  During the [Zombie Apocalypse](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-15/) in March 2020, for example, the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio was returning only +6%. 

Although the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is up an impressive +658%, it is still a distant second place behind the [2020 Top Ten Portfolio ](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-21)which is up +937%.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Speaking of other Top Ten Portfolios, let’s put them all together now:

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46): up +72% (total value $1,719)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): up +658% (total value $7,580)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +937% (total value $10,370)
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +399% (total value $4,987)

So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$24,656** ($1,719 + $7,580 + $10,370 + $4,987).

**That’s up +514%** on the combined portfolios, an all time high for the Top Ten Index Fund Experiment. Below is a table to help visualize the progress of the Experiment as a whole:

https://preview.redd.it/zshez2el5dz71.jpg?width=505&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31dfdb05d2d6256ddff463ec5ccaa913935f64b0

In summary: ***That’s a +514% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four straight years***.

## Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with traditional markets. 

https://preview.redd.it/l48hb3rn5dz71.png?width=542&format=png&auto=webp&s=34bb9821485a6c57028e21c16fb874e1501d89a6

Because the S&P 500 Index is up 84% since January 2019, the initial $1k investment I put into crypto thirty-four months ago would be worth $1,840 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 in January 2019. 

But what if I took the same world’s-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging $1,000-per-year-on-January-1st-Crypto-Index-Fund-Experiment approach with the S&P 500? It would yield the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,730 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,840 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,430 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,230 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,230** ($1,730 + $1,840 + $1,430 + $1,230)

That is up **+56%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+514%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of over nearly 458 percentage points ***in favor of crypto.***

Here’s a table providing an overview of the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P: 

https://preview.redd.it/onca33up5dz71.jpg?width=595&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=636eb71ff7a0a6ccc703830352eb52ccf31f2d44

## Conclusion:

To both old-timers and newcomers: thanks so much for taking the time to read and for supporting the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments. I hope you find the updates helpful in terms of perspective as you navigate the crypto landscape.  Be careful out there and don’t put your mental, physical, or financial health at risk chasing gainz. If crypto is causing you to lose sleep at night, chances are you have too much in crypto: try to think long term and don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.

Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects tracking the Top Ten cryptos as of [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46) (the OG experiment), [January 1st, 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-21), and most recently, [January 1st, 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9).",1563,2021-11-13 13:20:29,346
TRX,cryptocurrency,"I miss the times when BSV, Tron, EOS & Verge were our worst shitcoins","For all the shit we gave them, at least they had a team of people actually trying to make things happen..  

* **Bitcoin Satoshis Vision** (BSV) - A fork of Bitcoin Cash, but as they thought Bitcoin should be originally, instead of the lower block sizes of BCH.  
* **Tron** (TRX) - A rough copy of Ethereum's code but with a different consensus model. Uses 27 ""super representatives"" to control block production, which is highly centralised. I think Tron's mission was to try and create a case where media would be commissioned with Tron, and they bought the BitTorrent network developers but AFAIK nothing really came of it.  
* **EOS** (EOS) - Raised a staggering $4 BILLION dollars in a limitless ICO, but doubts on how funds were being allocated, constant network congestion issues and centralisation worries about just 21 Block Producers having control of the network have lead to EOS fizzling away.  
* **Verge** (XVG) - Had a gigantic, vertical rise in 2017/2018 hyped bull market. Supposed to be a privacy token, but has suffered numerous 51% attacks where legitimate transactions have even been reversed. Special note, they partnered with PornHub in probably the most over-hyped Crypto announcement yet and earned themselves the nickname ""Kleenex Coin"" which still makes me chuckle to this day.  

-----

Nowadays, what do we have? We have people jumping on the coattails of other coattails. Coins aren't even pretending to have goals or roadmaps any more, it's all just shit to sucker in kids and make them think that money comes from nowhere and everyone can be rich:  

* **Safemoon** (SFM) - Ugh. 260,000 redditors use this and they are only too happy to suppress negative discussion. Started out as a copy-paste of another whitepaper with some changed parameters. When users sell, 10% of the transaction is taxed where 5% is burned and 5% is redistributed amongst holders. With low volume and disinterest from new buyers, this is destined to crash and burn. Users of this are convinced it'll hit $0.01 which at current supply would give Safemoon a market cap of several trillion dollars...  
* **Shiba Inu** (SHIB) - Another dog coin to capitalise on the Doge bandwagon. Has absolutely no use case, no roadmap, nothing. Basically a crypto in name only. When the fun stops, expect devastation  
* **Dogecoin** (DOGE) - Started as a simple joke as an antithesis of Bitcoin's supply model. Infinite and rapid inflation. This is the original ""When the fun stops"" token because while it is still significantly up from start of the year, pushing the price up further from current will require a herculean effort and the coin is still a barebones, minimally developed effort which doesn't belong in the contemporary crypto scene as anything other than a joke coin.  
* **Cumrocket** (I'm not gonna look this ticker up) - Don't even know what to say. Another coin that capitalises on a gigantic supply and an incredibly small per-token price. All designed to make noobs think ""Well a penny isn't a lot of money, if it goes to a penny, I'll be a millionaire!"". I think this is meant to be used to pay for NSFW NFT's, though god knows why you wouldn't use an existing token.  
* **Goes Up Higher** (GUH) - Just another kind of horseshit token. The official word is that it's a token with a flexible supply, always aiming to be X percentage above Bitcoin's price. Heavily marketed as a get rich scheme so it's basically nothing more than a ponzi.

TRX,cryptocurrency,"Tron raised transaction fee, error FAILED OUT OF ENERGY when sending TRC20","2 days ago the TRON network raised the transaction fee, which caused some TRC20 transfers (USDT, USDC, BTT,...) to stop going out.

The official reason for raised energy price was announced in their twitter: ""After the proposal takes effect, it will effectively restrain the growth of the number of low-value smart contract transactions and reduce the harm they may bring.""

In general, supposedly this is done for our common good. But it seems that, as usual, they want more money.

After rising the cost of transactions many users can’t send their crypto tokens and receive error with not very informative text: ""FAILED OUT OF ENERGY"". If you are also affected and can not send money, this pieces of news regarding that problem from zebrasnake site, including reasons, details and solution ways, will be helpful for you.

&#x200B;

>Transactions in Tron are not processed, FAILED -OUT OF ENERGY error  
>  
>Since December 4, 2022, some customers, who are using Zebrascript to make payments and send money, began to receive an error message for some outgoing transactions on the Tron network. Various wallet users have also been affected by this problem. The cause, details and solution method will be examined below.  
>  
>The reason is simple and trivial – the Tron network raised the cost of resources required to operate smart contracts, while the amount of resources themselves remained the same.  
>  
>Details: required energy for one transaction in Tron network to send any crypto token, for example USDT, USDC and etc.: – 29650 energy if the receiving address is empty; – 14650 energy if the receiving address is not empty.  
>  
>Previously, the price of 1 energy unit was 280 SUN, but as of December 4, 2022 6:00 am UTC the price has increased and has become 420 SUN (1 TRX = 1,000,000 SUN). So the cost of energy for a transaction to an empty receiving address grew 50%, from 8.302 TRX to 12.453 TRX.  
>  
>And since many wallets (e.g., Atomic), as well as various Tron blockchain software (e.g., Zebrascript payment system aggregator script) set the transaction fee limit at 10 TRX, transactions to empty addresses began to end with a “FAILED -OUT OF ENERGY” error due to exceeding the TRX limit allowed for burning.  
>  
>At the same time, tokens continue to go properly to non-empty addresses, because the transaction fee does not exceed the established limit of 10 TRX, although it became higher.  
>  
>How to fix: just raise your transaction fee limit from 10 TRX to 15 TRX – this will be enough to keep your transactions moving.  
>  
>That said, if your wallet or software does not support changing the maximum commission size, this might be just the reason to change your wallet/software. For example, you can import a private key from your address with money into another wallet, say, in tronlink. Or wait for changes from developers in the new version. Or if you have a ledger purse, you can send transactions via tronscan.  
>  
>Zebrascript was originally designed to give maximum freedom and number of settings available to users. For them it’s enough to change the fee – just open settings of the corresponding payment gateway, select “technical” level of settings display, and set the desired value of “Fee limit (in TRX)”.

TRX,cryptocurrency,"Tether minted $3 billion in the past week, near$6 Billion in a month. This is a hugely bullish sign","Over the past week, Tether has minted $3 billion USDT. 

https://preview.redd.it/sjb6zytlw8pa1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ef4a913853d02cf0e0164d5d100fb3cf1dbfb74

This actually makes it $6 Billion Tether has minted in almost a month, definitely making it a fast mint rate for Tether.

Some might be quick to speculate if this is (more?) fraudulent activity by Tether. Whether you believe them to have been guilty of any of the accusations over the years, or not, is a different matter from what I wish to point out. Although on that point, Tether has come quite a ways into being *somewhat* more transparent and complying with regulation, properly backed issuance and being more trustworthy on the whole.

I see these mints as a hugely bullish sign. Tether would only seek to mint this huge amount of funds if there was demand for it. After all, more supply only dilutes prices and profits, even for the tiny margin that stablecoins trade off of. Meanwhile,Tether has only gained market share while other stablecoins have lost it. Therefore, stablecoins being a base that underpins almost all crypto trading pairs, any change in the market would be reflected mostly, and disproportionately so, in Tether's statistics and on-chain data. This is to say that the huge minting by Tether is a indicator or proxy for a massive surge in demand in crypto in general.

While this may not necessarily be big breaking news, it is still a huge confirmation. As we all obviously know that there is much more crypto demand, and where this demand came from. But it is a big bullish sign nevertheless.

It is harder to state if this new money ill be ""activated"" in price in non-stablecoin crypto tokens and cause those tokens' price appreciation, or buyers were simply looking to lock their money away in a dollar pegged-asset just to get away from banks, But even if  it sits only in dollar-pegged assets, some significant portion of it will eventually make it into non-stablecoins and Bitcoin as traders get more comfortable.

I know that most of it stems from past chain outages but looking into other players (eth for example) that's not something exclusive to Solana. Many other chains have experienced similar network issues without facing the same level of backlash.

Once you get past the noise, Solana seems to be in better shape than other top 10 chains. Solana Pay, Institutional partnerships, gaming, chain speed, hackathons everywhere, etc. - these are all growth indicators that Polygon, Avalanche, Tron, and others promised to deliver on and failed.

TRX,cryptocurrency,"If there ever is a USDT collapse, you will not escape it even if you don't use USDT.","I keep seeing a lot of posts and/or comments about how ""USDT is shady so I don't use it, I prefer USDC instead so I'll be fine even if they're gone"". This is a **grave misconception** that can have serious implications in the future.

&#x200B;

I'm here to demonstrate that ***even if you never touch USDT yourself,*** **you are indirectly using it if you're invested in** ***any*** **cryptocurrency.**

The main issue is: **USDT has more daily trading volume than all other 9 top-10 cryptoassets combined.**

It's safe to say that USDT is responsible for **over half the market's liquidity**.

As of this moment, the top10 cryptoassets by marketcap, and their daily trading volumes are:

* Bitcoin, with a daily trading volume of 5.837 billion USD
* Ethereum, with a daily trading volume of 2.564 billion USD
* **USDT, with a daily trading volume of 11.541 billion** USD
* BNB, with a daily trading volume of 0.267 billion USD
* XRP, with a daily trading volume of 0.386 billion USD
* USDC, with a daily trading volume of 1.443 billion USD
* ADA, with a daily trading volume of 0.100 billion USD
* DOGE, with a daily trading volume of 0.174 billion USD
* SOL, with a daily trading volume of 0.348 billion USD
* TRX, with a daily trading volume of 0.102 billion USD

&#x200B;

If you sum up all the trading volume of the other 9 coins you get a daily trading volume of **11.221 billion USD.** Meanwhile USDT's trading volume **is 11.541 billion**.

&#x200B;

The conclusion is what I previously stated: even if you never touched, even if you never even *heard* of USDT, the market you're invested in is, whether you like it or not, absolutely tainted with USDT trading.

TRX,cryptocurrency,A break down of the bull case for Ethereum and how it relates to Bitcoin,"**EDIT 11**: This was just a preliminary write up. You can read the full investment thesis (WIP) [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11oCA9iPtv6s-twhW6PdSpiENKCbeW7aJJO9Jv8KEc2g/edit?usp=sharing).

&#x200B;

There is a general understanding among ETH investors that the enhancements from ETH 2.0, EIP-1559 and L2 solutions will result in a sustainable monetary policy with near 0% issuance and the potential for Ether to become a deflationary asset. What is even more interesting is that the net return of ETH as a SoV becomes superior to BTC the moment that issuance is lower than the staking yield. In other words, even if BTC had already ceased issuance, it offers no mechanism to provide yield to long term holders with a negligible risk exposure as ETH does. There is an execution risk that Ethereum will not deliver on what is currently planned, but if it does then what I have explained will become a reality.

You cannot separate BTC/ETH's payment rails from their respective monetary policies. As you are probably aware, issuance is just a subsidy, and without it the network will need to operate as a profitable business with a cash-flow that is entirely dependent on network fees. We are observing a situation that is causing a degradation of the utility of the Bitcoin network. What I mean by that is that the incentive for users to transact directly on the network is being diminished because of the tokenization into ETH and by the introduction of custodians (like Paypal) and traditional banking services who will soon be entering this space. If these trends continue, I suspect that the only activity that will end-up happening on-chain will be done by whales sporadically transacting to hodle and the occasional settlement from institutions. Bitcoin seems fast and frictionless, but that is because you are comparing it to something in the physical world. In digital terms Bitcoin emulates the friction of operation that is found with gold: it is difficult and expensive to move it, securing it yourself is not trivial, and it does not make for a great medium of exchange. I don't think this will be a good dynamic to generate enough transaction fees. That is of course my subjective interpretation of it, but regarding this particular situation it is nearly impossible to make objective assertions at this point. It is possible to assert that, in the digital world, the expectation of frictionless money would entail near instant transactions with negligible cost and without the relative risk/paranoia of dealing with nuclear waste and having a hacker watching your every move waiting for you to make a mistake to snatch it away. Digital money would also need to interact with other digital assets, preferably defined and operated within the same ecosystem. Ethereum is steaming ahead on all ends.

Ethereum is fostering a digital economy (this is a very important part of understanding the value of Ethereum, but I will not be exploring it in this post) with DeFi at its center. It is currently generating about three times as much trx fee revenue as Bitcoin. L2 solutions are going live as we speak, and it appears that they will be much more practical and provide better UX when compared to the Lightning Network. This will help to amplify L1 block space value and push revenue even higher. That will be followed by EIP-1559, which will burn transaction fees. Mining is currently excessively profitable and the hash rate cannot keep up. This means the financial incentive can be reduced and by burning trx fees we achieve the equivalent of an issuance reduction, while stabilizing mining revenue. Eventually the transition to PoS will dramatically cut the operational cost of the network. That means that Ethereum as a business will become more profitable and less reliant on the issuance subsidy. Finally, we will see the introduction of sharding which will scale L1 by up to 1,000 times, compounding the effect of L2 solutions and making it feasible for the network to operate as a platform for new use cases. A solution to the hacker/nuclear waste security situation is being explored via social recovery wallets. It is still in the early stages of research and design, but it is important to realize that the Ethereum community recognizes it as a problem and is working on a solution.

There is a lot more that can be said about the BTC vs ETH debate and I am working on a full write up that explores each individual element in more detail. Regardless, it is important to pay attention to this trend: the smartest people in this space are shifting their point of view and realizing Ethereum's potential. Raoul Pal is a seasoned investor, extremely bright and open minded. He started with Bitcoin, but it did not take him long to understand the value proposition of Ethereum. Lyn Alden is a brilliant investor and mental powerhouse who initially did not think investing in Ethereum could be justified, but she is also[ starting to shift her view](https://www.lynalden.com/ethereum-analysis) and now understands that it has a justifiable risk/reward ratio to be included in a portfolio (although she is not personally invested in Ethereum). She has plenty of negative things to say about it, however it appears that she recognizes this is not a black and white situation. I have a feeling she will be revising her analysis on Ethereum again in the future with a more optimist view, but maybe that is just wishful thinking.

The crypto space has a few analogies that have been used to describe technical/economic mechanisms that are somewhat tricky to understand: mining, Ethereum's gas, and the analogy between ether and oil. Crypto ""mining"" is not like real world mining. It's purpose is not to extract resources, but it is rather a decentralized mechanism to process transactions. Newly minted BTC tokens are not ""mined"", they are minted by the protocol and awarded to operators. Furthermore, it is impossible to change the total mining output of the network... adding/removing miners does not affect the mining output. If you are new to crypto, you can read a more detailed explanation of mining[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/k4qdyc/if_you_are_new_to_crypto_you_may_be_slightly/). ETH's ""gas"" is not like fuel (it cannot even be stored). It is just a computational metric that is more akin to the distance a car must travel, but not what actually makes it move. The fuel is electricity and it must be paid for with ether. When you transact you are also paying for the ""car"" which is the use of all active mining hardware/validators for a fraction of a second. And ether is just money.

If you put too much weight on these simplified analogies, you will not understand the economic actuality behind them. This is a source confusion in the crypto space, and it is used to support false narratives. From an economic perspective, ether is money. Once you understand this, you will know that the narrative that BTC and ETH are not competing because they are different things is analogous to saying fax machines do not compete with the internet.

The beautiful thing about ether is that it is actually not ""just money"". It is a mixture of a scarce monetized commodity, money, bond and tech stock.

* **Monetized Commodity**: Ether is becoming more scarce and will continue to do so with the transition to proof-of-stake and EIP-1559. Ethereum does not have a supply cap, but it does have a roadmap for a sustainable security model and if it achieves a positive cashflow then it will not only eliminate issuance, it can become deflationary.[ An argument can be made about potential issues with Bitcoin's sustainability in the long run.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/k46gge/the_threat_to_bitcoin_that_no_one_is_talking_about/)
* **Currency**: Ether is used as a unit of account and medium of exchange to pay for every activity in Ethereum. It is also used in the same way for venture capital related to ICOs, and Ether is also used as collateral in the DEFI space and new monetary uses will continue to emerge. It is an immature form of money, just like Bitcoin is an immature form of gold. Some people prefer to say that Ether is just a utility token. However, a utility token is just a narrowly scoped form of money. Not only is Ether's scope within its digital economy growing, by next year users will be able to pay millions of merchants with Ether through Paypal. We have never seen the adoption of a new form of money grow organically. New forms of money have always been imposed by authorities. What would the organic growth of money look like? It would look like Ether.
* **Ethereum's digital economy**: Ethereum has limitless use cases and it is already generating economic activity with real world usefulness. Ether's value will benefit from acting as the native monetary asset for Ethereum. As Ethereum's economic activity grows, the velocity and/or value of ether must also increase.
* **Bond**: With proof-of-stake you need to lock up Ether to receive a yield in return. It is similar to how bonds work.
* **Tech Stock**: Ethereum provides a service. That service is paid with ether. The network is controlled by holding ether that is staked. The more valuable the service provided by Ethereum becomes, the more users will be willing to pay for transactions and the more valuable the protocol and the Ether token become. Cloud based services is the entire business model of many companies. The network will be entirely operated by stakers who happen to be the recipients of transaction fees. It is not exactly the same as holding a stock, but there are a lot of parallels.
* **Full reserve banking model**: This is a bit of a stretch, but it is a potential end-game for Ethereum. It can serve as the base infrastructure and reserve asset for a full reserve banking system. In a nutshell: a consortium of banking companies can be formed to standardize a framework to hold and stake Ether under custody in exchange for wrapped Ether. Customers deposit Ether, banks exchange it for wETH and stake the original ETH. Resting balances of wEther on customer accounts can receive a cut of the staking rewards. Banks get their profit model, customers get to spend wrapped Ether with traditional banking services and potentially receive a share of the staking yield. Customers could also have access to a yield curve based on variable reserve requirements. This would allow banks to create money (which is actually good for the economy when it is done with moderation), but for the first time ever customers would have the choice of how much risk exposure they are comfortable with. This dynamic could help to establish a form of democratic check and balances system that discourages moral hazard. Ether could become a godsend to banks in the land of negative yields. It's a pipe dream, but not entirely impossible. Don't forget that the US OCC has essentially given banks the green light to take the first steps in this direction (US banks have been approved to use the Ethereum blockchain for their operations AND they can become validators... yup this happened).

&#x200B;

**EDIT 1: Adding an analogy to explain why ether is money:**

Let’s say I have a car with a 14-gallon fuel tank and I want to take it on a road trip. The car is not aware of the price of gasoline, and it would not travel any farther if the price of gas would double the next day. That’s because the intrinsic utility of oil has nothing to do with its monetary value. The car needs gas because of its particular physical properties and how the ICE is designed to utilize it. If I want to drive from point A to point B and it takes a full tank to get there, it will take that full tank no matter what happens to the monetary properties of gas/oil. This is fundamentally different from how Ethereum uses ether.

Ethereum (the network) is not trying to be money, but it utilizes ether exclusively for its monetary properties and not because it can be magically burned by an imaginary engine of sorts. It costs money to participate in the network as a miner, and their engagement is financially incentivized with ether. Block space is a scarce resource, therefore participants who wish to transact use ether to bid for it. These interactions are utilizing ether as a monetary medium of exchange. In the long run, as the price of ether goes up, the ether denomination of gas prices goes down. That happens because no one is using ether as gas/oil, and it is actually being used as money. In the short run you may see the opposite occurring because of the dynamic between the portion of block space demand that is inelastic and the demand for ether.

**EDIT 2: Revisiting key concepts to explain how they will become price catalysts.**

1. **Wide adoption of L2 solutions**: these will amplify the base layer block space value while encouraging further network adoption by a significant reduction of fees. A successful integration with DeFi protocols will dismiss the ""Ethereum killers"" theory and consolidate market confidence.
2. **EIP-1559**: reduce excessive financial incentives to miners by burning transaction fees. This will also discourage miners from attempting to artificially raise fees via spam.
3. **Sharding**: scale L1 bandwidth, compounding the effect of L2 solutions, further consolidating Ethereum's dominance in the DeFi space, making it feasible to introduce new use cases and eventually increase trx fee revenue.
4. **The switch from PoW to PoS**: discontinuing PoW will eliminate the operating costs related to mining and will allow for a reduction of issuance. Money that was previously allocated to buying mining equipment will be redirected to the acquisition of Ether. Staking Ether will remove it from circulation for extended periods of time. Operating cost will be negligible, allowing validators to withhold most of the Ether revenue. This will be the greatest bull market catalyst in the history of cryptocurrencies and it will eclipse the effect of[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=cashtag_click)BTC halvenings.

Bitcoin maximalists will be nay-saying all the way through and past a market cap flip. Do not get caught up in their narrative. If you are not sure, then it is better to rebalance your portfolio proportionally to market caps. If none of these things happen and Ethereum turns out to be a failure, then you would only have reduced your gains by 20%. Otherwise, ETH will be making you mountains of money.

**EDIT 3:** **Ethereum killers**

Ethereum killers remind me a lot of Tesla killers, but a lot worse. People need to understand that cryptocurrency platforms targeting financial Dapps are fighting the equivalent force of a black-hole when it comes to Ethereum’s network effect and user retention in this space.

Bigger players, with bigger money, are entering this market and they will not settle for anything other than the top dog. This pattern reinforces Ethereum's position as the premium financial system, which ends up attracting even bigger players and resulting in the black-hole effect. To make matters even more complicated, financial apps are more valuable when they are surrounded by a rich and diverse variety of digital assets and other natively defined Dapps. There is not much you can do with your money in a ghost town.

It is VERY difficult to build this type of environment up because the platform and dapps must also have established full trust from their user base. This is not to say there is no space for other networks to grow, but just don’t get your hopes high that they will be taking Ethereum’s stronghold as a financial system. There are other use cases that do not require the amount of decentralization and security offered by Ethereum, and the networks that can focus on these are the ones who will be able to coexist with in the long-run. Gaming, ERP interoperability and supply chain are good examples of such use cases. Remember that alternatives with cheap transactions have existed for a while and they have barely touched ETH's dominance (EOS, NEO, VET, QTUM, IOTA, LSK, STRAT, ARK and dare I say... TRON).

**EDIT 4: Refuting critiques about dynamic monetary policy**

If an argument can be made that the financial incentives to operators (miners/stakers) are excessive or insufficient then an argument can be for the implementation and execution of a dynamic monetary policy.

I don't think an arbitrarily picked issuance schedule determined during the genesis of a new highly complex system is likely to be efficient through its lifecycle. Bitcoin's monetary policy provides the certainty of stability and protection from abuse, but it sacrifices the possibility of efficiency and jeopardizes longevity. It would be like if a captain of a ship would point it in the direction of its final destination, set the throttle, then fall back to his cabin for a nice bottle of chianti and hope that the ship would arrive safely. There would be no one at the helm to navigate the seas, no one to make sure it stayed on route, no one to avoid the storms or to take advantage of currents. In my opinion it is a pretty bad approach to something as critical as monetary policy.

With respect to Ethereum's dynamic monetary policy: I don't see any evidence to suggest developers have been enriching their pockets by keeping issuance at the levels they are. Developers are stakeholders and the Ethereum fund holds a lot of ether - debasing ether is against their self interest. There is a great misunderstanding that the one's who are adjusting issuance are the recipients of the new tokens. Is there any documented case of this happening?

**EDIT 5: Addressing Bitcoin's immutable monetary policy**

The idea that Bitcoin's monetary policy cannot be changed is a myth. It is a false narrative that takes for granted that the issuance subsidy will no longer be necessary at some point, but there is no way to objectively assert this. There is no divine power preventing the monetary policy from being changed. If the security model for Bitcoin was jeopardized because of insufficient cash flow to miners, then Bitcoin's monetary policy would be the first thing on the chop board to go in order to remedy the situation.

**EDIT 6:** Five years ago naysayers were screaming about how everything that is being done TODAY in the Ethereum network would never work. Now they are calling Ethereum a scam, or that is is a platform for degenerate gamblers, or that the fees are too high and therefore it is useless, or that it can't scale, or that something else better is just around the corner to take its place.... you know... basically all the things that traditional bankers have to say about Bitcoin, maxis are saying about Ethereum.

**EDIT 7:** The greater the impact a new technology can have on society, the more difficult it is to comprehend its potential. Ethereum has the potential to have a dramatic impact on human civilization. It could take decades for it to be fully realized, but it would change the world in ways that we cannot possibly imagine today. If it happens, the moon will be just a pit-stop.

**EDIT 8:** Thank you so much for all the awards! Ethereans understand this stuff, and I could feel the frustration in the air every time someone said that Ethereum is not money, or that ETH and BTC are completely different things, or all the other bs attacks that are in great part founded on a lack of understanding of how BTC and ETH actually work. I would love to hear what guys like Raoul Pal, Pomp, Michael Saylor and Fernando Ulrich (for my Brazilian friends) would have to say about some of the things that have been written here. If you know a way to get their attention, then please do it.

**EDIT 9**: Clarification about Lyn Alden's opinion of Ethereum

**EDIT 10:** I am still working on a much more ambitious write up. It is focused on economic aspects of money, monetary systems and global asset markets. I still have not incorporated any of the information written here, but I eventually will merge it together. One of the main new ideas that I am exploring is challenging the notion that money has no intrinsic value and that scarcity is the most important attribute of money. I think I make a compelling argument to demonstrate that facilitating economic activity is more important, and how Ethereum has a big edge over Bitcoin in this regard.

I know I could have paid less, but how less! The transaction wouldn't have gone through with 1 dollar of fee. 


Anyhow, instead I used the Tron network. And the transaction was completed in mere seconds, without any fees at all. Like seriously, no fee whatsoever. 


I was wondering why don't people use other chains when one is congested. do people like traffic jams 😅.
Because in real world if one high way is congested and the others are free you would prefer to travel by the other highways.",3,2021-11-06 07:40:25,46

TRX,cryptocurrency,"So... are we going to ignore that TRON (TRX), with 7.5 BILLION market cap, is pretty much following LUNA's footsteps?","[TRON (TRX) is currently the #14 coin by market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/). The coin has seen an insane increase over the past couple months.

TRON has recently launched its algorithmic stablecoin [USDD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usdd/). The algorithm governing the stablecoin’s dollar-peg is an arbitrage trade between USDD and TRX, Tron's network’s native token. *Hmm... this reminds me of something but I can't put my finger on it....*

Now here's this week's best offer! [You can earn up to 57% through sun.io's LP!](https://imgur.com/a/JoFQgSH) What a great deal.

According to [Defillama](https://defillama.com/peggedassets/stablecoins) USDD is #10 stablecoin by market cap, with a 20% increase over the past week, this figure is up from $90 million recorded during its day of launch on **May 5, 2022**. *Hmm... I have a vouge memory of something that happened in early May 2022...*

Oh and we haven't even checked the **project's founder, Justin Sun.**

Let's get started:

Justin Sun launched TRON's whitepaper during the ICO craze in 2017, days before China's ban on ICO's. He raised $70 million and left the country. Sun had been **tipped off by Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance.** Does this also sound familiar....? 

On top of that. [it's been also reported that he copy pasted the project's whitepaper from another coin](https://coincentral.com/community-accuses-tron-plagiarizing-whitepaper/). This only adds to the pile of cards that his so called ""algorithmic stablecoin"" is a scam waiting to collapse.

It is no coincidence that Justin also left China, days after the ICO ban was announced.

On top of all that, it's been reported that:

* He hosted a ton of fake giveaways in 2019 announcing fake winners and retracting prizes.

* He announced fake partnerships with big organizations such as Liverpool F.C., who have denied connections.

* It's been reported that Justin has sold most of his TRON coins after the ICO and bought a large chunk of ETH. Some say he owns more ETH than the projects' Co-Founder Vitalik.

[You can read more here](https://www.theverge.com/c/22947663/justin-sun-tron-cryptocurrency-poloniex)

So, what do we make of all these? Justin Sun, the creator of TRX and USDD, not only literally copy pasted everything, he has also been involved in a huge amount of sketchy dealings and scams. 

My hope is that people like Justin and projects like LUNA and TRX are wiped off entirely from the market, for this is the only way to move forward and build something meaningful.

TRX,cryptocurrency,"TRX has become a literal Ponzi scheme, and is following a hybrid playbook from SBF, Clesius and Do Kwon. I still see people talk about this like it's a regular shitcoin, it's not. Since USDD was launched in 2022 it's become a direct scam.","USDD is a ponzi scheme which is slowly unraveling in the background. It's a textbook flywheel and I have no idea why people aren't talking about it. Especially given Justin has a history of rug pulls and scams.

USDD was launched by Justin Sun **after** the collapse of Terra Luna. It's an algorithmic stablecoin paying unsustainable APY and it's backed by, you guessed it, TRX.

Users deposit TRX into the burn contract and are issued equivalent USDD based on the spot value of the TRX. It's even better as he used the money from USDD to purchase an exchange which holds huge amounts of genuine user funds, anybody remember something else like that recently?

So let's look at USDD. How did they incentivise cash to get locked into the protocol? They offered 40% APY on Justin's newly purchased exchange Huobi. Two times the interest rate of a high interest credit card. As they've continued draining user funds they've been lowering that APY to keep the ponzi running, they're currently paying 15.5% APY, **still significantly higher than the deposited money can earn**, and more than enough incentive to keep genuine cash wrapped up in the system until the death spiral. When people begin withdrawing they start pumping the APY again to kick the can down the road.

The coin is meant to be 'over collateralised'. At the start on paper it was 'over collateralised' to the tune of 210%! The DAO guarantee 120% total backing, and right now despite the huge market uptick we're sitting at 175%. That's a 35% drop in on paper overcollateralisation since launch, against the backdrop of a crypto market that's surged 60%. That means in reality close to **half the cash has already been drained**.

But the situation is actually much worse, because when it started a third of the money (on paper) was USDC (it wasn't really, this was another layer to the scam but it's irrelevant right now). 100% of the stables have been drained and exchanged with more TRX. They have 4 dollars in USDT and that's the total of their remaining stable coin collateralisation. 

Every other dollar in USDD is now in BTC and TRX, and I think you can guess which of these makes up the lions share of the 'over collateralisation'. On paper they have 1.2b in assets backing 750m in issued coins, with 775m in TRX making up the bulk of that. For a time they can do what they've been doing and use unbacked USDD to buy TRX in order to maintain the price of that asset until the collapse, but as with any scam it can't go on forever. It will keep running until one of the following happens

&#x200B;

1. TRX price collapses (difficult as it's being flywheeled through the USDD and customer funds, this is how it somehow defied the bear and drew users in)
2. BTC price drops and causes lack of collateralisation, or BTC stops growing fast enough to offset the drain
3. Justin finishes draining everything he can and disappears to a private island

It could make it a year, it could make it two, or it could get wiped out in the next week - in either case it will get wiped out, it's just a matter of who gets left holding the bag. My guess is Huobi customers.

**TL;DR USDD is a hybrid scam based on all the others we saw last year. 95% of the 'money' in USDD is Justin Sun and co. The APY mill is an exchange Justin Sun owns, most likely paying the APY from genuine users funds, and Justin is using those funds to purchase his TRX and make hundreds of millions of dollars in exit liquidity without instigating a sell off.**",472,2023-04-14 04:35:34,293
TRX,cryptocurrency,Justin Sun just released a marketing video about “hackers shorting Crypto“ and how he saves all of Crypto and then the TRX price goes up. This kind of marketing is certainly a red flag…,"Would it really be a day in Crypto without some superb and cringe drama here? Well, I don‘t think so, and today we are already not missing out at all. Jus about a few hours ago we saw an animated video released on Twitter/X from Justin Sun, founder of Tron, and it most definitely embodies Justin Sun…

# Story Overview:

So, the story starts with some AI system giving out the warning that “hackers are shorting Crypto“ (which does not make sense btw) and then the animated Justin Sun for some reason puts on VR sets and goes into a world that is being eaten by something purple (probably representation for hackers). Anyways he saves the day with some sky beam, just like a true Avenger, and then the TRX price jumps up for some reason. 

And yeah, after that he goes to mars for some reason, probably because it looked cool. 

# Personal Opinion:

Generally there is of course nothing against any company or Crypto doing marketing for themselves, but it is quite weird once that marketing involves their creator “saving“ a whole industry and they market the TRX price pumping. I think marketing of Crypto projects has been done a lot, but most of it involved some partnerships and use-cases being marketed. Not a whole Avengers movie trailer, whose only element about Tron is that it‘s price is pumping after saving Crypto…

TRX,cryptocurrency,USDD and TRX has the exact same mint and burn mechanism that killed UST and Terra. Here's how to short.,"***Important Edit:*** *Someone just mentioned there seems to be no contract for minting TRX right now. I double checked the white paper and looks like the full mint and burn mechanism wont be implemented until November. Until USDD can be burned for newly minted TRX there is 0 chance of a failed mint and burn scenario similar to Terra / UST*

Just pulled up the white paper for USDD. Seems that the ""stability"" mechanism for USDD is the exact same as UST.

Here's the white paper so you can read for yourself [https://usdd.io/USDD-en.pdf](https://usdd.io/USDD-en.pdf)

Page 3 and 4 show very plainly what the mint and burn mechanism is. You don't have to know much about any of this to understand it. Simply 1 USDD can be burned for $1 equivalent of TRX minted. $1 worth of TRX can be burned for 1 USDD minted.

Looks like right now USDD borrow rates on [justlend.org](https://justlend.org) are 5%

So if you want to short USDD with leverage here's how to do it.

1. Deposit collateral on [justlend.org](https://justlend.org) \- Eth, BTC, USDC take your pick
2. Borrow USDD
3. Immediately sell USDD for more collateral
4. Deposit collateral
5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 depending on how much leverage you want exposure too

The loan to value ratio on justlend will determine how many times you can repeat this process. Each time you repeat steps 2 and 3 you increase your leverage. So at 10x leverage every 1% move in either direction is a 10% gain or loss. You'll want to figure out what the liquidation threshold is so you don't lose your collateral.

Some of the more obvious risks in this trade are the APY you pay on borrowed USDD, not managing your collateral and getting liquidated, and also maybe a not so obvious one is since justlend runs on tron, its worthwihile to think about if USDD and TRX fail will Tron shutdown? In the event of a network shutdown you wont be able to repay your USDD and release your collateral.

There's also a much easier way to short Tron and USDD in the event of a failure of the mint and burn mechanism. Just set an alert (or program a script if your savvy enough) and short TRX on a centralized exchange like Kucoin if USDD depegs to $0.97 then short TRX with leverage in your margin account. I'm sure you can find TRX perpetuals on other exchanges too if you want to increase your leverage. Then if USDD repegs you close the trade. Rinse and repeat every time USDD depegs.",357,2022-06-03 08:39:49,193
TRX,cryptocurrency,"Is NANO on path to transform digital cash, the same way as email did, back in the 90's? Does the ""lack of incentive to run a nano node"" debate still makes sense when 1 nano trx burns 2 million x less energy than its BTC equivalent ?","I'm really curious about your point of view.  Price related comments not welcome (tired of this).    
When I see how cheap and simple it is to run a nano node, I completely reevaluate the perspective of achieving **organic and long lasting decentralization** based on the most simple hardwares;  The level of interest/incentive needed in the ecosystem can be as little as holding a few bucks or running a business interacting with the payment system.   The ratio ""incentive to run a node / cost to run a node"" could even exceeds the viability of the BTC equivalent ratio, this later being based on competition, concentration in pools and obsolescence of hardwares (not considering huge pollution and waste of energy).  

I see Nano nodes evolving the same as free **email providers** do, when offering ""free email service"".  The consequence of this design is the need  launch a dynamic anti-spam system, and nano seems to have it.  P2PoW allows even anyone to collaborate in this solution, without even the need for running a node, especially since it is all about preventive ""micro-Pow"" infinitely smaller than BTC Pow.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.

20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that

24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.

46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",14811,2021-02-09 12:03:25,1588
TRX,cryptocurrency,FTX Is Taking Back Funds From Users Who Withdrew on 11th November,"FTX official Twitter released an update yesterday that some number of users who withdrew funds from FTX International on the 11th face having these funds taken back. It is not certain what group or number of users are affected. The funds are being returned to FTX, to be accessible and adjudicated upon by bankruptcy courts. As it is the entire FTX group including FTX US that filed for bankruptcy, it is unclear why FTX has not stated that this also affects FTX US withdrawals.

This most likely refers to Bahamian funds on the platform where SBF and FTX both (in separate similar tweets) claim that Bahamian regulators mandated FTX International to permit withdrawals by Bahamian citizens, a claim strongly later denied by the regulators.

FTX and SBF also agreed to a credit facility with Justin Sun and his DAO Tron to permit withdrawals but only using Sun-owned token BTT,  TRX, SUN, JST, and HT. This credit facility was instituted 10th Nov such that FTX may also be referring to funds transferred out through this facility on the 11th as well, as any assets left on the platform at bankruptcy time would have already been declared through courts.

Lastly, very confusingly, Bahamas regulators have acknowledged seizing assets from FTX. However it is also very unclear whether this seizure refers to the entire sum of missing funds of FTX assets or just some portion of it. The tweet may *also* be referring to the 'stolen' sum of money that represents the balance of what regulators did not seize. These funds however are only reclaimable if the hacker(s) made a rookie move and utilized centralized exchanges.",2788,2022-11-21 10:55:43,1031
TRX,cryptocurrency,Justin Sun of TRX did NOT cash out any of the 34 billion tokens he promised to lock away,"This is in response to the accusations that I've been seeing this morning. The intention of this post isn't to shill TRX, or speak to the quality of the product one way or the other. My intention is simply to clear up the accusation that Justin Sun has sold some of the 34 billion TRX tokens that he claimed to be locking away until 2020.

But as you can see from his [Ethereum account](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa18ff761a52ce1cb71ab9a19bf4e4b707b388b83#tokentxns) the 34 billion tokens have not been touched for 18 days since he moved them there in the first place.

As for the 6 billion tokens in question, I do not know what is going with them. But clearly they aren't part of the 34 billion that he has locked away.

TRX,cryptocurrency,Why I feel scammed by the TRX project," 

In May 2018 I read about the upcoming mainnet swap of Tron, so I created an account on [tron.network](https://tron.network/) as instructed. On the account creation prcess I was provided a 2FA backup code which I wrote down, but no seed for my wallet. Found it fishy but since this was the only advertised way to take part in the mainnet swap I went for it. Then I got some TRX of IDEX exchange ( [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf9f119e59b2a1cd822a8d7cdd004378f388254df097bd5327b28cb78cf08812c](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf9f119e59b2a1cd822a8d7cdd004378f388254df097bd5327b28cb78cf08812c) ) and sent them to my [tron.network](https://tron.network/) wallet ( h[ttps://etherscan.io/tx/0xad575bb787f3b2d034f03ccbd8b706fd69fcc0d7c3605298309ecf8f0a6eb668](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xad575bb787f3b2d034f03ccbd8b706fd69fcc0d7c3605298309ecf8f0a6eb668) )

I am not a full time crypto trader, so in the bear market I decided to just leave my tokens where they are, in good faith I had done the only thing neccessary to get my tokens swapped.

2 weeks ago I wanted to transfer my TRX to my Scatter wallet when I noticed a message on [tron.network](https://tron.network/) giving a deadline to withdraw my TRX until December 2018. This deadline clearly being over I wrote an email to[withdraw@tron.network](mailto:withdraw@tron.network) as instructed in that same message mentioned above. I have not gotten any answer to this email until today.

I went into Trons telegram channel and got some support by a nice guy named Andrew. He said there was a problem on their side but they should be able to track it down when I find the original TXs (which I did). After 2 days I was told there is nothing they can do and suddenly it should have been my fault because I missed the mainnet swap deadline. My argument that I didn't miss it as being proved by my TXs remains unanswered for over 2 days now.

So here I am, being locked out of my TRX. I feel scammed because I took actions for the mainnet swap thinking I was safe after that. How many times will Tron set deadlines where you can loose your tokens? Gives me a bad feeling for the future of the project.",349,2019-04-20 10:14:13,147

TRX,cryptocurrency,Yesterday i payed for coffee with Bitcoin in ...... IRAN.,"Im visiting my home country and my family since last week and yesterday i was having a coffee in a cafe with some friends. While checking out i saw this sign above the counter that blew my mind. It said that you could pay with Bitcoin, XRP, Doge, TRX, Litcoin, Ethereum, BitcoinCash, Monero or ETH classic! 

https://preview.redd.it/n56n3sb1n8n71.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9e54aec43f3b117602c0050e600566ac33b389f

I asked if anyone paid with crypto before? and they said only one. I am not a fan of paying for daily needs with crypto just yet and i thought El Salvador accepting BTC as a legal tender was too early but i really needed to try this so i paid for everyone with BTC and it was nice.

With the current inflation in Iran which is INSANE and is estimated to be around 50 to 150% most people are converting their savings to US dollars and now crypto. 1 USD equalls to 280000 Iranian Rials today. I hope crypto saves most of us.",3897,2021-09-13 09:19:03,949
TRX,cryptocurrency,How Justin Sun used his TRX and BTT coins to exploit and Rugpull and already Rugpulled and desperate FTX customers.,"[I was just watching Tiffany Fong's interview with someone \(no idea his job's exact name\) who buys settlements, etc.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huotjgwVCU) Anyway, the guy in the interview explained that when FTX shut down withdrawals as the news of their insolvency was hitting the news, Justin Sun went to Twitter and other news websites relative to crypto. And told everyone that if they convert their holdings to TRX, they can withdraw. 

If you go to Google and search: FTX TRX Withdrawals, you can read more info about it. In short this is how crazy it got:

> Tron-based tokens sell at 1200% premium as FTX users scramble to withdraw

Here is a relevant tweet:

https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1590762821159116800

According to the person in the video, on FTX Justin's TRX was unoffically trading at upwards of $3 per coin from the now price of .11 cents. It was maybe .03 cents back when FTX went down. Holy crap. I was not prevy to this. The fact that Justin Sun and his inner circle rug pulled an already rug pulled people just makes me sad.",113,2024-01-04 00:19:00,40

TRX,cryptocurrency,TRX is probably only as relevant as it is because of how cheap fees are. Otherwise it's mostly trash like everything Justin Sun touches,"Currently, TRX sits at #16 on the top 100 list. With all the shadiness than Justin Sun is involved in, the high rank of it is honestly shocking. But when you consider the utility of TRX, or ask many people why they use it, you only get two words: cheap fees. Other than the cheapness of TRX, it seems to offer little else. And if it's one thing I will admit, it is that the token's tokenomics, if you can call it that, was cunningly designed from the very beginning to funnel in folk who don't really understand that the token is about, and frankly don't really care.

It isn't even just that the network fees are cheap. It's also that withdrawal fees from exchanges themselves are also cheap. This was probably deviously designed in the listing agreement with the exchanges as well. And remember that Cefi accounts for over 80% of volume. So anytime someone wants to transfer between exchanges or even to Defi, TRX would be one of the first choices if not the first. So a mostly useless token as managed to gain huge market share off *one little trick.*

Sun himself is of course being sued by the SEC for pump-and-dump, schemes, unregistered securities among other things. And TRX itself is also heavily ted to lots of illegal gambling. I myself have uncovered a number of online (obviously illegal) Chinese casino that use his network and tokens(like BTT) to launder their funds. They typically run through Telegram(what scammer doesn't use Telegram?) where uses can indicate and relevant positions in the game and some bot spits out the winning combinations and you supposedly collect your earnings in USDT on Tron. You also deposit bets in USDT mostly. The casino themself would use BTT very often to transfer funds. Don't know why you'd trust a bot for a fair casino but that's how they do it.

We of course can't forget how Justin Sun this tokens of JST,SUN, BTT,TRX to absolutely shaft FTX customers who had money stuck on FTX after the collapse and were desperate to withdraw. SBF and FTX worked out a 'Credit Facility' that would allow users to withdraw but only using these Sun-owned tokens. As a result, these tokens prices shot up as high as 4000% above market prices. So you'd be able to withdraw but only after:

1. Pumping up the prices and popularity of Sun-owned tokens
2. Paying ridiculously above-market prices . Such that you could withdraw but would make huge losses to do so.

And Sun just walks away with big profits off desperate customers with no other choice, As far as I'm concerned, the volume of tokens was intentionally kept to precisely to pump prices. This is proven as the total liquidity promised through the Credit Facility agreement was never met, and even if it was would fall woefully short of demand.",58,2023-04-15 22:42:34,83

AVAX and LINK will push their way in.

I can't see TRX breaking the top ten. It's had a decent climb but it has been steady due to people using it as a bridge for sending. 

I just hope meme coins like SHIB stay out.

And what are the chances SOL flips ETH? I'm thinking it'll be low, due to volume ETH continues to generate.

TRX,cryptocurrency,"The top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence: the updated version","It's been 6 months since my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lg1yhv/for_the_newcomers_the_top_50_cryptocurrencies/) trying to sum up the biggest cryptos in a few words. I feel like an updated version is long due and so here we are.

As usual, if something is wrong or you would like to make a correction, feel free to comment. It's obviously hard to sum up each project in a few words, but I tried my best.

Terms used:

* If I refer to layer-2 solutions, that means a protocol or framework built on top of an existing blockchain and trying to increase transaction speed or scaling.
* [PoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work): Proof of Work
* [PoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake): Proof of Stake

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009 and since then it has become much more of a Store of Value than a currency, given its scarcity and high security, although layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network allows for fast and cheap transactions.
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** the coin of the Ethereum blockchain, the first smart contract platform and the one having the biggest ecosystem of decentralized applications around: since ETH price is used to pay fees to interact with the network, a bigger ecosystem means higher demand. It is (and will be) used for staking in Ethereum 2.0 (which is PoS).
3. **Tether (USDT):** the most discussed stablecoin around, pegged to the dollar price although many believe it is not fully backed: for this reason its market cap has been decreasing for the first time ever and other stablecoins are gaining traction.
4. **Binance Coin (BNB):** the official Binance coin and the one used to pay fees on the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain like Ethereum but less decentralized and with cheaper fees (not counting any layer 2 solutions).
5. **Cardano (ADA):** the coin of the PoS blockchain Cardano, created by the Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and developed strictly following peer-reviewed research, which slowed down development. Lots of partnerships and a big community make it one of the biggest ETH contenders.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** a centralized coin trying to redefine online payments, has had a rough time after the SEC went after it but seemingly it's coming out on top.
7. **USD Coin (USDC):** another stablecoin tied to the dollar and managed by the company Circle. Considered more trustworthy than Tether, it's been growing non-stop adoption-wise.
8. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** such wow, even higher ranking than last time. *sigh*
9. **Polkadot (DOT):** it's the coin of Polkadot, a multichain protocol aiming to connect different chains, both public and private, allowing to transfer data between one another or to create new custom blockchains. ChainLink's oracle pallet and Kusama are examples of projects built on top of it.
10. **Binance USD (BUSD):** another stablecoin pegged to the dollar, managed by Binance in partnership with Paxos.
11. **Uniswap (UNI):** the first token on the list, it's used to govern the decentralized trading protocol Uniswap, probably the biggest and most known DeFi application built on Ethereum.
12. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** a fork of Bitcoin trying to increase scalability and lower transaction fees increasing the blockchain block size, which achieves these features but reduces [decentralization](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f32dac47-a7a6-4e5d-af5b-28e4f1d87287).
13. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin younger brother, been around since 2011. It's based on the Bitcoin code but with some tweaks, lowering transaction speed and cost, many sees it as the ""silver"" of crypto since it's been around for so long.
14. **Chainlink (LINK):** between one Ganon and the other Link is also the official token of ChainLink, a network that basically bridges off-chain data with smart contracts: an example is Synthetix, a derivatives protocol that uses Chainlink to get the price feed of a certain asset on their smart contract.
15. **Solana (SOL):** one of the latest Ethereum contenders, launched in 2020 and offering possibly the highest layer-1 thoughput of all (50k transaction per second!), but is still somewhat centralized (although this is being addressed) and has yet to build a competitive ecosystem.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** it's a tokenized version of Bitcoin so it can be used on the Ethereum network and in DeFi applications.
17. **Polygon (MATIC):** the most popular layer-2 solution for Ethereum, Matic is the official coin of Polygon and used to pay fees on it: many Ethereum applications are moving there but it's still not easy to use with few exchanges supporting it directly.
18. **Ethereum Classic (ETC):** native token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain, a hard fork of Ethereum that claims to be more tied to Ethereum original plan. It has suffered various 51% attacks in the past years.
19. **Stellar (XLM):** created by an ex-Ripple founder, its aim is to become a currency and to allow to trade assets in a cheap and fast way. Last time I joked it was a 40c stablecoin, now I wished that held true.
20. **THETA (THETA):**  The token of THETA, a decentralized video delivery network (in a p2p fashion), used mainly for governance.
21. **DAI (DAI):** the biggest stablecoin not pegged 1-to-1 (or at least not claiming to) to the dollar, but soft-pegged and using cryptocurrencies deposited in smart contracts to collaterize the newly minted tokens.
22. **Internet Computer (ICP):** after its disastrous launch earlier this year, it almost overthrew Dogecoin as the biggest meme in the space. Jokes aside, it's a blockchain aiming to revolutionize the current internet, claiming to run at the same speed as the current web.
23. **VeChain (VET):**  Once everyone's favorite coin in this sub, was hit hard in the May crash and only lately recovering. Vechain is a blockchain focusing on business use-cases and supply chain management, VET (and VTHO) are the blockchain's official coins.
24. **Filecoin (FIL):**  the most popular IPFS (Interplentary File System), a peer-to-peer storage network without having to rely on cloud storage companies.
25. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron's founder Justin Sun is like Jian-Yang, great at repackaging other projects (thanks to u/fbslo on the last post). Jokes aside, it's a blockchain platform for decentralized applications more focused on content sharing and entertainment.
26. **Monero (XMR):**  Monero's goal is  to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, Monero obscures even senders and recipients whereas BTC doesn't. 
27. **Aave (AAVE):** a lending-borrowing decentralized protocol on Ethereum (and Polygon), the AAVE token grants discounted fees on the platform and act as a governance token.
28. **TERRA (LUNA):** Terra is a blockchain protocol offering a variety of applications, from stablecoins to synthetic assets and stocks. LUNA is the native token used to stabilize the price of UST (the TERRA stablecoin) and peg it to the dollar, and can be used to pay fees on the network.
29. **EOS (EOS):** another PoS blockchain launched in 2018, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It is designed to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology. 
30. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the native token of the Crypto.com chain and the Crypto.com exchange. Similar to the BNB token, it is closely tied to the success of the exchange.
31. **AMP (AMP):** it's an Ethereum token and it's used as collateral on the Flexa network, covering any financial transactions that fail if the need arises.
32. **Axie Infinity (AXS):** without a doubt the most popular blockchain game, a mix of Pokémon and Tamagotchi that follows the Play-To-Earn model. AXS is the token used for governance and soon staking.
33. **PancakeSwap (CAKE):** the most popular decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain, it started off as a copy of the Uniswap AMM model to then provide a variety of services.
34. **FTX Token (FTT):** the native token of the FTX platform, specialized in trading derivatives. It can be used as collateral or for discounts on trading fees.
35. **Bitcoin BEP2 (BTCB):** another tokenized version of Bitcoin, this time on the Binance Smart Chain.
36. **The Graph (GRT):**  It is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS like Filecoin. Basically simplyfing the retrieval of data on blockchains for developers and applications.
37. **Algorand (ALGO):** founded by the MIT professor Silvio Micali, it's a PoS blockchain supporting smart contracts, with low fees and high throughput of operations.
38. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):**  A utility token related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex. 
39. **Maker (MKR):** Maker is a token on the ethereum blockchain use for governance of the MakerDAO and Maker protocol, the organization behind the DAI stablecoin.
40. **Cosmos (ATOM):** dubbed the ""internet of blockchains"" by its founders, it solves the problem of interoperability between blockchains and provides tools to developers to build their own blockchains. Atom is the coin powering the platform and some notable projects built on top of it are Terra and Crypto.com chain.
41. **SHIBA INU (SHIB):** a meme coin that exploded in May, recently ShibaSwap was launched to give some sort of use-case to the coin which got a 3% score by DeFi Safety (later updated to 35%).
42. **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** a hard fork of a hard fork (BCH), it claims to be the true Satoshi Nakamoto vision of Bitcoin with an even bigger block size. Can't come up with a better joke than last time, I'm sorry.
43. **Tezos (XTZ):** another PoS Ethereum competitor. XTZ is the official coin used for governance and staking. One characteristic is that it is unforkable: it's impossible to create duplicates as instead happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum.
44. **Klaytn (KLAY):** a blockchain using a hybrid design between public and private chains, allowing anyone to create their own chain easily and without any technical knowledge, trying to appeal to companies and institutions mainly.
45. **NEO (NEO):**  *Noone can be told what it is, you'll have to see if for yourself.* Just kidding: launched in early 2014, it's a blockchain not too different from Ethereum where NEO is the coin used for governance. It has a Smart Economy System using digital assets (linked to a physical one) and verificable digital identities on smart contracts. 
46. **IOTA (MIOTA):**  open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things,  it uses a inventive blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same, with zero transactions fees and good scalability.
47. **Compound (COMP):** it's the governance token of Compound, a borrowing and lending platform not too different from Aave, launched in 2018 and with one of the biggest locked value of DeFi applications.
48. **TerraUSD (UST):** it's a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is available in different blockchains and it's getting more and more adoption, rising the price of Luna (which is directly tied to the demand for UST).
49. **Avalanche (AVAX):**  open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange. With an high throughput and good scalability, anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. 
50. **Theta Fuel (TFUEL):** it's another native token of the Theta blockchain, it acts as a gas token to power the operations on the blockchain and is used for payments to relayers (users sharing their computing power).

Its great for transferring funds. I'm not sure it's great for much else, since it does seem to be filled with a bunch of shady dapps.

# Okay, the Summary First | TLDR | Drug Cartels

No, this one is not from South America or the mafias around the world. This news is about the drug cartels in China, having alleged association with the CCP. And their money of choice? Crypto and that too, Tron.

An X user going by the name (@)boringsleuth has come to the limelight with his claim of uncovering evidence of Tron being used by drug cartels to run the show.

Here is the tweet (or is it xeet?):

https://preview.redd.it/pv7thcqr2lsb1.jpg?width=1019&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2655f4b5ef40c32fab7a0b1ba92f1fc748e5eca8

**\*\*Source:\*\*** newbtc(dot)com

So far so good. But what has shaken the cryptoverse is the naming of Ethereum as also one of the cryptos backed by the CCP. According to (@)boringsleuth, CCP is allegedly supporting ETH and other blockchains and controlling a few DEXs and CEXs.

While at the moment the user signs off saying Ethereum has strong connections with the CCP and that he/she will be back with more evidence, it has left the crypto users in a tizzy. His evidence to even stake claim to an alleged connection is a single address owned by the CCP receiving 133,700 ether on a single genesis block.

Such is the furor over the ETH claims that no one is talking about Justin Sun or TRON.

# Now Everything Other Than TLDR | TRON the Ponzi | Could ETH also be?

The X user (@)boringsleuth has made a name for himself/herself in the cryptoverse with the alleged unmasking of Tron, a cryptocurrency, as a potential Ponzi scheme used to fund the drug cartels operating out of China. While Justin Sun is at the helm of affairs on Tron, it is not Tron or Justin that is in the limelight.

It is the reference of Ethereum and the founders having proximity to the authorities in China, which has the cryptoverse divided. A well-respected and number 2 coin by market cap to be caught in this web is the real deal. While (@)boringsleuth did give reference to one of the transactions to a wallet owned by the high and mighty in China, he has vowed to come back with more evidence.

Personally, this is one piece of news I wouldn’t mind being wrong; especially, in this bear market.

TRX,cryptocurrency,"After Do Kwon and SBF, Justin Sun (and TRX) might be the next one to watch out for","First of all I’d like to direct you to a five month old post from u/derpjungler 

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/v1mrz5/so_are_we_going_to_ignore_that_tron_trx_with_75/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

It was published in the aftermath of the LUNA debacle and showed that the TRX-USDD scheme wasn’t that different from LUNA/UST. 

It also showed how shady Justin Sun is. For example Sun is accused of having copied the white paper of another coin.  He announced fake partnerships and fake prize giveaways too. And he apparently sold a lot of his shares in TRON to buy ETH instead.

Since then TRON has been holding up okay but Sun has been in the headlines a few times, like when he reportedly took over Huobi or at least became an executive advisor, leading to the exit of both the CEO and CFO. 

And finally as we all know he put himself in the spotlight in the FTX collapse by offering to help, but some pointed out here that his “help” only seem to have been to himself by putting money in his own pockets. This post outlines the shadiness of this “help” provided by TRX.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/yrr630/sam_bankmanfried_mightve_just_committed_another/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


Just a reminder than TRON has the third DeFi TVL. I looked for a while but I can’t find a post or article I read a few months ago about how most tokens on the chain are puns based on Sun and there were some accusations of Sun artificially pumping that TVL. 

So if TRON was to collapse due to a USDD depeg or because of Justin Sun’s shady activities, the crypto world would face another nightmare. Also because there is now more USDT traded on the TRON chain than on the Ethereum chain. And I for one would prefer for USDT to stay out of big collapse events right now.


Edit: as some pointed out, of course get your own wallet to reduce exposure to Sun’s scams, a cold one preferably. And avoid buying shitcoins. But even if you only buy BTC and put it on a hardware wallet it won’t stop the price dumping if a top 20 crypto collapsed because of its shady founder.",30,2022-11-11 16:20:21,46
TRX,cryptocurrency,I calculated how much a coin would be worth from a 1K investment now if it ever reaches back to its all time high.,"You can see the glass half full or half empty.  If you believe that your favorite cryptocurrency will get back to its ATH here is how much it would be worth with a 1K USD investment.  Glass empty crowd here is how much some of these coins has dropped from ATH. 

For example, for BTC a 1K investment now, if and when it reaches back to its ATH would be 3.4K.  For ETH it would be 4.3 K and for something like DOT it would be 7.8 K or HNT it would be 5.9K.

TLDR; are you a glass half full or empty? If you think your crypto will reach its all time high again then its a simple decision. 1K in BTC 3.4K and 1K in LRC is 9.5 K. Half empty, LRC is down 89% and BTC is down 71%

ctrl+f and find your fav coin.

addendum: as pointed below - for shit & giggles here is how it would look like for the infamous LUNA classic: 

current is: 0.0001288 assuming ATH was ~ 115

TRX,cryptocurrency,"Can anyone ELI5 the technical differences between projects like Ethereum 2.0 (ETH), Polkadot (DOT), Cardano (ADA), IOTA (MIOTA), Cosmos (ATOM), Avalanche (AVAX), Tron (TRX), EOS, etc?","Lately I've been seeing a lot of hype surrounding these projects that claim to be building things like a ""decentralized web"" or ""blockchain interoperability"", but I've struggled to find any good, simple comparisons of the various projects. I'm relatively knowledgable on cryptocurrency/blockchain technology, but the comparisons I have found have all been either far too technical, not technical enough, filled with buzzwords/jargon that I can't follow, obviously biased, or only compare two or three of these seemingly similar projects.

The things I'd like to know about each are

* What problems is the project attempting to solve?
* How does the project plan to solve these problems? ie What are the primary goals of the project?
* What is the current state and ETA of a functional release of the project?
* In what ways is the project similar or dissimilar to other similar projects?
* What are the pros and cons of the project as compared to others? Especially considering fees, confirmation/transaction time, and energy efficiency.",77,2021-02-18 17:13:03,73

TRX,cryptocurrency,Users in FTX are converting their crypto to TRX hoping to cashout,"It all started yesterday when Justin Sun(Houbi) tweeted that users can exchange (TRX , BTT , JST , SUN, HT)  at 1:1 even if they cannot be withdrawn on FTX.

https://twitter.com/HuobiGlobal/status/1590237713781121024

Then today Justin Sun tweeted about talking with FTX (idk if theres someone to talk) so people can withdraw TRX from FTX to Houbi https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1590539831276634112

Problem is price of TRX on FTX is 0.38$ it peak 2.5$ which is so much higher than the original price  so even if you can withdraw you can only get 5% of your crypto in usd maybe

The scammer controls the account by multi-sig and will leave a nice balance of usdt or simular on the wallet, when you send trx to pay the gas it will automatically withdrawal any trx within a minute of conformation.

TRX,cryptocurrency,[SERIOUS] 50% of Justin Sun's Huobi Reserves Are Made Up of HT and TRX Tokens That Are Centrally Controlled By Sun and Huobi,"To clear up any misconceptions early, the founder of Huobi was set to sell 100% of his stake in Huobi. Justin Sun bought what is likely some significant part of the stake if not 100% of it. Officially, he describes himself as an 'global advisor'  yet there are many reports of him making very powerful and sweeping changing at the firm, such as taking control of and overhauling entire departments that are of significance. SBF was also rumoured to be involved in the deal as taking part in discussions and meetings. There were also reports that he set on firing significant amounts of staff that were later 'denied' by Huobi but they still said to be possible. Many of the execs left also when Justin came into his management powers. This is also why HT was included in the list of Sun-owned tokens involved in the FTX credit facility allowing FTX users using Sun-owned tokens to withdraw after FTX fell apart, another hint of deeper ties between SBF and SBF.

Now, Huobi published their asset transparency report which is basically a preliminary publishing to their proof of reserves. As is the case with an alarming number of exchanges, their proof of reserves is only a snapshot, after which funds can be liquidated, shifted or manipulated any way they like if they so choose. Regardless, the reports paints a strange picture.

50% of the funds in Huobi reserves are made up of TRX(\~15%) and HT(\~35%) tokens.  This may pose several issues.

1. How much of user funds are actually backed fully and how much is made up of printed TRX and HT tokens?
2. This high percentage is made up of exchange controlled funds can be indicative of another 'FTT infinite money scheme'. Sun himself admitted he owns 'tens of millions of HT', likely in addition to what is held on Huobi. With an market cap of only around 700 million, he controls a very significant portion of HT such that a scheme like this is very profitable, and feasible, for him. Him mimicking SBF's FTX-Alameda-similar situation is not all that unlikely as I already pointed out the links between SBF and Sun.
3. Such a high percentage of exchange controlled funds can lead of ease of market manipulation. Especially between the HT controlled by Sun and Huobi itself, Sun effectively can control prices however he likes. We also saw Sun's willingness to do just this as in the FTX credit facility when they blocked deposits of Sun-owned tokens leading to prices rising as high as 4000% above the market price as users desperate to withdraw bought these tokens at any price. Sun(and SBF) also deliberately caused the price spike by limiting token liquidity injection to $13M(supply) when there were about $9B(demand) stuck on FTX. Sun made a killing off of this, as of course **HE** could withdraw his profits but other users couldn't.
4. If user funds *do happened* to be fully backed, why do exchange-controlled tokens represent half of its reserves? At worst, this bodes of manipulation/fraud and even at best it represents a HUGE single point of failure for Huobi. A fall in price in either token could have disastrous consequences.

&#x200B;

Additional to point 1, I can see Sun using customer funds to buy his own tokens to pump his own bags of the many HT and TRX tokens he owns,  such that they may have the capital value of the backing but not actually hold the 'physical' coin reserves. But of course, this is just *speculation* *right.*

Huobi also abandoned their own stablecoin HUSD(issued by Stable Universal) early this year. More recently, they delisted the token and it depegged all the way to $0.15. This is planned to be replaced by Sun's USDD. Sun's DAO Tron in February named SBF's Alameda Research a whitelisted institution permitting Alameda the rights to mint and the right to burn  USDD as well as act as advisor and recommender to the network. Just another of the Sun-SBF ties.

&#x200B;

Tldr: Clearly, (as pointed out in point 4), this is a terrible sign. Justin Sun does not have a great track record so in the worst case this cause mean some deep manipulation/fraud. Even in the best case giving the greatest benefit of the doubt it is still terrible to have such a heavy reliance and dependence on the two tokens alone. This situation doesn't look good at all.

TRX,cryptocurrency,How does this TRX scam even work ?,"There's a scam going around, and i recived the following message on twitter:

`Hi! i'm a student I received a sum of 680USDT(trx20) but I don't know how to sell USDT to get USD into my bank account. . Can you teach me how to use my Trust wallet? I will pay 200USDT as a reward! 12 Mnemonic Phrase Tron: [Scammer Seed] password private key: [Scammer Private key]`

When you try to import the wallet you get to a wallet that has 1000 ish USDT on the TRON network, but the wallet has also about 1Tron (which is not enough to withdraw the usdt), the scam consists in people (you, the victim) sending their TRX to the wallet so they can then try to steal the funds, things is some bot syphons all the TRX (that you sent to the wallet) as soon as it arives in the wallet, what i don't understand is that, even if you try to retrieve a small ammount of USDT from that scam wallet, where the fee should be less than a single TRX (the account always has 1 TRX), you get a signature error no matter what you try

So my question his, how is that even possible, how can the USDT be there in the wallet but somehow untouchable ? how does that scam work ?",14,2022-07-13 19:25:42,41

TRX,cryptocurrency,"If there ever is a USDT collapse, you will not escape it even if you don't use USDT.","I keep seeing a lot of posts and/or comments about how ""USDT is shady so I don't use it, I prefer USDC instead so I'll be fine even if they're gone"". This is a **grave misconception** that can have serious implications in the future.

&#x200B;

I'm here to demonstrate that ***even if you never touch USDT yourself,*** **you are indirectly using it if you're invested in** ***any*** **cryptocurrency.**

The main issue is: **USDT has more daily trading volume than all other 9 top-10 cryptoassets combined.**

It's safe to say that USDT is responsible for **over half the market's liquidity**.

As of this moment, the top10 cryptoassets by marketcap, and their daily trading volumes are:

* Bitcoin, with a daily trading volume of 5.837 billion USD
* Ethereum, with a daily trading volume of 2.564 billion USD
* **USDT, with a daily trading volume of 11.541 billion** USD
* BNB, with a daily trading volume of 0.267 billion USD
* XRP, with a daily trading volume of 0.386 billion USD
* USDC, with a daily trading volume of 1.443 billion USD
* ADA, with a daily trading volume of 0.100 billion USD
* DOGE, with a daily trading volume of 0.174 billion USD
* SOL, with a daily trading volume of 0.348 billion USD
* TRX, with a daily trading volume of 0.102 billion USD

&#x200B;

If you sum up all the trading volume of the other 9 coins you get a daily trading volume of **11.221 billion USD.** Meanwhile USDT's trading volume **is 11.541 billion**.

&#x200B;

The conclusion is what I previously stated: even if you never touched, even if you never even *heard* of USDT, the market you're invested in is, whether you like it or not, absolutely tainted with USDT trading. If USDT were to pop out of existence, whether to a hack, a scam exit, the SEC, Gensler going Super Saiyan 3 on them or anything of the sort, you *will* be affected by it.",352,2023-09-10 12:42:11,531
TRX,cryptocurrency,A break down of the bull case for Ethereum and how it relates to Bitcoin,"**EDIT 11**: This was just a preliminary write up. You can read the full investment thesis (WIP) [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11oCA9iPtv6s-twhW6PdSpiENKCbeW7aJJO9Jv8KEc2g/edit?usp=sharing).

&#x200B;

There is a general understanding among ETH investors that the enhancements from ETH 2.0, EIP-1559 and L2 solutions will result in a sustainable monetary policy with near 0% issuance and the potential for Ether to become a deflationary asset. What is even more interesting is that the net return of ETH as a SoV becomes superior to BTC the moment that issuance is lower than the staking yield. In other words, even if BTC had already ceased issuance, it offers no mechanism to provide yield to long term holders with a negligible risk exposure as ETH does. There is an execution risk that Ethereum will not deliver on what is currently planned, but if it does then what I have explained will become a reality.

You cannot separate BTC/ETH's payment rails from their respective monetary policies. As you are probably aware, issuance is just a subsidy, and without it the network will need to operate as a profitable business with a cash-flow that is entirely dependent on network fees. We are observing a situation that is causing a degradation of the utility of the Bitcoin network. What I mean by that is that the incentive for users to transact directly on the network is being diminished because of the tokenization into ETH and by the introduction of custodians (like Paypal) and traditional banking services who will soon be entering this space. If these trends continue, I suspect that the only activity that will end-up happening on-chain will be done by whales sporadically transacting to hodle and the occasional settlement from institutions. Bitcoin seems fast and frictionless, but that is because you are comparing it to something in the physical world. In digital terms Bitcoin emulates the friction of operation that is found with gold: it is difficult and expensive to move it, securing it yourself is not trivial, and it does not make for a great medium of exchange. I don't think this will be a good dynamic to generate enough transaction fees. That is of course my subjective interpretation of it, but regarding this particular situation it is nearly impossible to make objective assertions at this point. It is possible to assert that, in the digital world, the expectation of frictionless money would entail near instant transactions with negligible cost and without the relative risk/paranoia of dealing with nuclear waste and having a hacker watching your every move waiting for you to make a mistake to snatch it away. Digital money would also need to interact with other digital assets, preferably defined and operated within the same ecosystem. Ethereum is steaming ahead on all ends.

Ethereum is fostering a digital economy (this is a very important part of understanding the value of Ethereum, but I will not be exploring it in this post) with DeFi at its center. It is currently generating about three times as much trx fee revenue as Bitcoin. L2 solutions are going live as we speak, and it appears that they will be much more practical and provide better UX when compared to the Lightning Network. This will help to amplify L1 block space value and push revenue even higher. That will be followed by EIP-1559, which will burn transaction fees. Mining is currently excessively profitable and the hash rate cannot keep up. This means the financial incentive can be reduced and by burning trx fees we achieve the equivalent of an issuance reduction, while stabilizing mining revenue. Eventually the transition to PoS will dramatically cut the operational cost of the network. That means that Ethereum as a business will become more profitable and less reliant on the issuance subsidy. Finally, we will see the introduction of sharding which will scale L1 by up to 1,000 times, compounding the effect of L2 solutions and making it feasible for the network to operate as a platform for new use cases. A solution to the hacker/nuclear waste security situation is being explored via social recovery wallets. It is still in the early stages of research and design, but it is important to realize that the Ethereum community recognizes it as a problem and is working on a solution.

There is a lot more that can be said about the BTC vs ETH debate and I am working on a full write up that explores each individual element in more detail. Regardless, it is important to pay attention to this trend: the smartest people in this space are shifting their point of view and realizing Ethereum's potential. Raoul Pal is a seasoned investor, extremely bright and open minded. He started with Bitcoin, but it did not take him long to understand the value proposition of Ethereum. Lyn Alden is a brilliant investor and mental powerhouse who initially did not think investing in Ethereum could be justified, but she is also[ starting to shift her view](https://www.lynalden.com/ethereum-analysis) and now understands that it has a justifiable risk/reward ratio to be included in a portfolio (although she is not personally invested in Ethereum). She has plenty of negative things to say about it, however it appears that she recognizes this is not a black and white situation. I have a feeling she will be revising her analysis on Ethereum again in the future with a more optimist view, but maybe that is just wishful thinking.

The crypto space has a few analogies that have been used to describe technical/economic mechanisms that are somewhat tricky to understand: mining, Ethereum's gas, and the analogy between ether and oil. Crypto ""mining"" is not like real world mining. It's purpose is not to extract resources, but it is rather a decentralized mechanism to process transactions. Newly minted BTC tokens are not ""mined"", they are minted by the protocol and awarded to operators. Furthermore, it is impossible to change the total mining output of the network... adding/removing miners does not affect the mining output. If you are new to crypto, you can read a more detailed explanation of mining[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/k4qdyc/if_you_are_new_to_crypto_you_may_be_slightly/). ETH's ""gas"" is not like fuel (it cannot even be stored). It is just a computational metric that is more akin to the distance a car must travel, but not what actually makes it move. The fuel is electricity and it must be paid for with ether. When you transact you are also paying for the ""car"" which is the use of all active mining hardware/validators for a fraction of a second. And ether is just money.

If you put too much weight on these simplified analogies, you will not understand the economic actuality behind them. This is a source confusion in the crypto space, and it is used to support false narratives. From an economic perspective, ether is money. Once you understand this, you will know that the narrative that BTC and ETH are not competing because they are different things is analogous to saying fax machines do not compete with the internet.

The beautiful thing about ether is that it is actually not ""just money"". It is a mixture of a scarce monetized commodity, money, bond and tech stock.

* **Monetized Commodity**: Ether is becoming more scarce and will continue to do so with the transition to proof-of-stake and EIP-1559. Ethereum does not have a supply cap, but it does have a roadmap for a sustainable security model and if it achieves a positive cashflow then it will not only eliminate issuance, it can become deflationary.[ An argument can be made about potential issues with Bitcoin's sustainability in the long run.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/k46gge/the_threat_to_bitcoin_that_no_one_is_talking_about/)
* **Currency**: Ether is used as a unit of account and medium of exchange to pay for every activity in Ethereum. It is also used in the same way for venture capital related to ICOs, and Ether is also used as collateral in the DEFI space and new monetary uses will continue to emerge. It is an immature form of money, just like Bitcoin is an immature form of gold. Some people prefer to say that Ether is just a utility token. However, a utility token is just a narrowly scoped form of money. Not only is Ether's scope within its digital economy growing, by next year users will be able to pay millions of merchants with Ether through Paypal. We have never seen the adoption of a new form of money grow organically. New forms of money have always been imposed by authorities. What would the organic growth of money look like? It would look like Ether.
* **Ethereum's digital economy**: Ethereum has limitless use cases and it is already generating economic activity with real world usefulness. Ether's value will benefit from acting as the native monetary asset for Ethereum. As Ethereum's economic activity grows, the velocity and/or value of ether must also increase.
* **Bond**: With proof-of-stake you need to lock up Ether to receive a yield in return. It is similar to how bonds work.
* **Tech Stock**: Ethereum provides a service. That service is paid with ether. The network is controlled by holding ether that is staked. The more valuable the service provided by Ethereum becomes, the more users will be willing to pay for transactions and the more valuable the protocol and the Ether token become. Cloud based services is the entire business model of many companies. The network will be entirely operated by stakers who happen to be the recipients of transaction fees. It is not exactly the same as holding a stock, but there are a lot of parallels.
* **Full reserve banking model**: This is a bit of a stretch, but it is a potential end-game for Ethereum. It can serve as the base infrastructure and reserve asset for a full reserve banking system. In a nutshell: a consortium of banking companies can be formed to standardize a framework to hold and stake Ether under custody in exchange for wrapped Ether. Customers deposit Ether, banks exchange it for wETH and stake the original ETH. Resting balances of wEther on customer accounts can receive a cut of the staking rewards. Banks get their profit model, customers get to spend wrapped Ether with traditional banking services and potentially receive a share of the staking yield. Customers could also have access to a yield curve based on variable reserve requirements. This would allow banks to create money (which is actually good for the economy when it is done with moderation), but for the first time ever customers would have the choice of how much risk exposure they are comfortable with. This dynamic could help to establish a form of democratic check and balances system that discourages moral hazard. Ether could become a godsend to banks in the land of negative yields. It's a pipe dream, but not entirely impossible. Don't forget that the US OCC has essentially given banks the green light to take the first steps in this direction (US banks have been approved to use the Ethereum blockchain for their operations AND they can become validators... yup this happened).

&#x200B;

**EDIT 1: Adding an analogy to explain why ether is money:**

Let’s say I have a car with a 14-gallon fuel tank and I want to take it on a road trip. The car is not aware of the price of gasoline, and it would not travel any farther if the price of gas would double the next day. That’s because the intrinsic utility of oil has nothing to do with its monetary value. The car needs gas because of its particular physical properties and how the ICE is designed to utilize it. If I want to drive from point A to point B and it takes a full tank to get there, it will take that full tank no matter what happens to the monetary properties of gas/oil. This is fundamentally different from how Ethereum uses ether.

Ethereum (the network) is not trying to be money, but it utilizes ether exclusively for its monetary properties and not because it can be magically burned by an imaginary engine of sorts. It costs money to participate in the network as a miner, and their engagement is financially incentivized with ether. Block space is a scarce resource, therefore participants who wish to transact use ether to bid for it. These interactions are utilizing ether as a monetary medium of exchange. In the long run, as the price of ether goes up, the ether denomination of gas prices goes down. That happens because no one is using ether as gas/oil, and it is actually being used as money. In the short run you may see the opposite occurring because of the dynamic between the portion of block space demand that is inelastic and the demand for ether.

**EDIT 2: Revisiting key concepts to explain how they will become price catalysts.**

1. **Wide adoption of L2 solutions**: these will amplify the base layer block space value while encouraging further network adoption by a significant reduction of fees. A successful integration with DeFi protocols will dismiss the ""Ethereum killers"" theory and consolidate market confidence.
2. **EIP-1559**: reduce excessive financial incentives to miners by burning transaction fees. This will also discourage miners from attempting to artificially raise fees via spam.
3. **Sharding**: scale L1 bandwidth, compounding the effect of L2 solutions, further consolidating Ethereum's dominance in the DeFi space, making it feasible to introduce new use cases and eventually increase trx fee revenue.
4. **The switch from PoW to PoS**: discontinuing PoW will eliminate the operating costs related to mining and will allow for a reduction of issuance. Money that was previously allocated to buying mining equipment will be redirected to the acquisition of Ether. Staking Ether will remove it from circulation for extended periods of time. Operating cost will be negligible, allowing validators to withhold most of the Ether revenue. This will be the greatest bull market catalyst in the history of cryptocurrencies and it will eclipse the effect of[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=cashtag_click)BTC halvenings.

Bitcoin maximalists will be nay-saying all the way through and past a market cap flip. Do not get caught up in their narrative. If you are not sure, then it is better to rebalance your portfolio proportionally to market caps. If none of these things happen and Ethereum turns out to be a failure, then you would only have reduced your gains by 20%. Otherwise, ETH will be making you mountains of money.

**EDIT 3:** **Ethereum killers**

Ethereum killers remind me a lot of Tesla killers, but a lot worse. People need to understand that cryptocurrency platforms targeting financial Dapps are fighting the equivalent force of a black-hole when it comes to Ethereum’s network effect and user retention in this space.

Bigger players, with bigger money, are entering this market and they will not settle for anything other than the top dog. This pattern reinforces Ethereum's position as the premium financial system, which ends up attracting even bigger players and resulting in the black-hole effect. To make matters even more complicated, financial apps are more valuable when they are surrounded by a rich and diverse variety of digital assets and other natively defined Dapps. There is not much you can do with your money in a ghost town.

It is VERY difficult to build this type of environment up because the platform and dapps must also have established full trust from their user base. This is not to say there is no space for other networks to grow, but just don’t get your hopes high that they will be taking Ethereum’s stronghold as a financial system. There are other use cases that do not require the amount of decentralization and security offered by Ethereum, and the networks that can focus on these are the ones who will be able to coexist with in the long-run. Gaming, ERP interoperability and supply chain are good examples of such use cases. Remember that alternatives with cheap transactions have existed for a while and they have barely touched ETH's dominance (EOS, NEO, VET, QTUM, IOTA, LSK, STRAT, ARK and dare I say... TRON).

**EDIT 4: Refuting critiques about dynamic monetary policy**

If an argument can be made that the financial incentives to operators (miners/stakers) are excessive or insufficient then an argument can be for the implementation and execution of a dynamic monetary policy.

I don't think an arbitrarily picked issuance schedule determined during the genesis of a new highly complex system is likely to be efficient through its lifecycle. Bitcoin's monetary policy provides the certainty of stability and protection from abuse, but it sacrifices the possibility of efficiency and jeopardizes longevity. It would be like if a captain of a ship would point it in the direction of its final destination, set the throttle, then fall back to his cabin for a nice bottle of chianti and hope that the ship would arrive safely. There would be no one at the helm to navigate the seas, no one to make sure it stayed on route, no one to avoid the storms or to take advantage of currents. In my opinion it is a pretty bad approach to something as critical as monetary policy.

With respect to Ethereum's dynamic monetary policy: I don't see any evidence to suggest developers have been enriching their pockets by keeping issuance at the levels they are. Developers are stakeholders and the Ethereum fund holds a lot of ether - debasing ether is against their self interest. There is a great misunderstanding that the one's who are adjusting issuance are the recipients of the new tokens. Is there any documented case of this happening?

**EDIT 5: Addressing Bitcoin's immutable monetary policy**

The idea that Bitcoin's monetary policy cannot be changed is a myth. It is a false narrative that takes for granted that the issuance subsidy will no longer be necessary at some point, but there is no way to objectively assert this. There is no divine power preventing the monetary policy from being changed. If the security model for Bitcoin was jeopardized because of insufficient cash flow to miners, then Bitcoin's monetary policy would be the first thing on the chop board to go in order to remedy the situation.

**EDIT 6:** Five years ago naysayers were screaming about how everything that is being done TODAY in the Ethereum network would never work. Now they are calling Ethereum a scam, or that is is a platform for degenerate gamblers, or that the fees are too high and therefore it is useless, or that it can't scale, or that something else better is just around the corner to take its place.... you know... basically all the things that traditional bankers have to say about Bitcoin, maxis are saying about Ethereum.

**EDIT 7:** The greater the impact a new technology can have on society, the more difficult it is to comprehend its potential. Ethereum has the potential to have a dramatic impact on human civilization. It could take decades for it to be fully realized, but it would change the world in ways that we cannot possibly imagine today. If it happens, the moon will be just a pit-stop.

**EDIT 8:** Thank you so much for all the awards! Ethereans understand this stuff, and I could feel the frustration in the air every time someone said that Ethereum is not money, or that ETH and BTC are completely different things, or all the other bs attacks that are in great part founded on a lack of understanding of how BTC and ETH actually work. I would love to hear what guys like Raoul Pal, Pomp, Michael Saylor and Fernando Ulrich (for my Brazilian friends) would have to say about some of the things that have been written here. If you know a way to get their attention, then please do it.

**EDIT 9**: Clarification about Lyn Alden's opinion of Ethereum

**EDIT 10:** I am still working on a much more ambitious write up. It is focused on economic aspects of money, monetary systems and global asset markets. I still have not incorporated any of the information written here, but I eventually will merge it together. One of the main new ideas that I am exploring is challenging the notion that money has no intrinsic value and that scarcity is the most important attribute of money. I think I make a compelling argument to demonstrate that facilitating economic activity is more important, and how Ethereum has a big edge over Bitcoin in this regard. Here is the [link to the WIP doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11oCA9iPtv6s-twhW6PdSpiENKCbeW7aJJO9Jv8KEc2g/edit?usp=sharing).

**EDIT 11**: Updated the link for the WIP doc.

TRX,cryptocurrency,"USDD and TRX, Another case of a algorithmic stable coin?","I check regularly Defillama to see movements of money on chains.

  
Today, I see Tron Chain has gone up 14.78% in TVL.

Once I go and check the protocols I see JustLend as the top protocol within the chain.

Within the protocol, I see that USDD (a stable coin) is providing 19.94%. Now, i understand that this is a lending protocol and therefore the people that are borrowing will ultimately pay for this interest. Given what has happened this week with the whole debacle of UST and Luna, I decided to take a read into its whitepaper.

[https://usdd.io/USDD-en.pdf](https://usdd.io/USDD-en.pdf)

Now, onto point 5 in this whitepaper:

""  Adjustment of short-term price fluctuation 

The USDD protocol runs on the TRON network, of which TRX is the native token and the most natural defense against USDD price fluctuations. The USDD protocol uses TRX as the base currency to price USDD. The USDD protocol maintains the market price of USDD around the target price regardless of market conditions using the following method: 

● When USDD's price < 1USD, users and arbitrageurs could swap 1USDD to 1USD worth of TRX in the protocol. When 1USDD = 0.9USD, an arbitrageur can buy 1USDD with 0.9USD in the external market and then swap 1USDD for 1USD worth of TRX in the system. After that, the arbitrageur can sell 1USD worth of TRX in the external market at 1USD. In this way, the arbitrageur spends 0.9USD to get 1USD, and earns 0.1USD without taking any risks. As a result of the above arbitrage, 1USDD will be burned, and 1USD worth of TRX will be minted. As the supply of USDD decreases, USDD's price will increase, to the point where there is no room for arbitrage and 1USDD re-equates to 1USD. 

● When USDD's price > 1USD, users and arbitrageurs could swap 1USD worth of TRX to 1 USDD in the protocol. When 1USDD = 1.1USD, an arbitrageur can pay 1USD for TRX of the same value in the external market and then swap 1USD worth of TRX for 1USDD in the system. After that, the arbitrageur can sell 1USDD in the external market at 1.1USD. The arbitrageur spends 1USD to get 1.1USD and earns 0.1USD without taking any risks. As a result of the above arbitrage, 1USD worth of TRX will be burned, and 1USDD will be minted. As the supply of USDD rises, USDD's price will go down, to the point where there is no room for arbitrage and 1USDD re-equates to 1USD. ""

&#x200B;

How is this different from Luna/UST? 

USDD has a market cap of 300M$ at this point. It isn't the same market cap of Luna/UST, and therefore, it wont have the repercussions in the market as the whole value gets depleted, however, still has the potential of liquidating holders if the principles are the same.",21,2022-05-14 19:35:14,39
TRX,cryptocurrency,"Top 25 Cryptocurrencies - 3 Pros, 3 Cons","I haven’t seen a thread aggregating what are perceived to be the biggest strengths and weaknesses of all of the top cryptocurrencies so I thought I’d have a go at that here as it is not only useful for me personally but probably also a number of other people relatively new to the world of cryptocurrencies.

To start with, I’ve listed 3 pros and 3 cons for each of the top 25 assets. I’ll try to remain objective. However, I am not a financial advisor, and this is based solely on my own reading and what I think seems to be some kind of consensus. If you think there needs to be things added or removed, let me know below and I’ll endeavour to update this list in reasonable time. Also, please feel free to help me add any other coins below.

I hope this can be a civil discussion without the need for tribalism.

Edit: These just happened to be the top cryptoassets by market capitalisation at the time I wrote this. This does not mean they are the _best_ cryptoassets. (Hence no NANO, Tezos, ZEC, ALGO, VET, etc.)

# What is it?

Launched under the slogan of ""Decentralizing the Web"" in September 2017, the TRON platform is promoted as a decentralized blockchain focused on smart contracts and high performance as the foundation of its content sharing system. While these features were initially focused on the entertainment industry and content sharing, the developers of TRON now promote their platform as the basis for a ""new"" and decentralized World Wide Web. Furthermore, TRON wants to become a fully developed operating system. with the aim of simplifying the distribution of customized decentralized applications (dApps). 

# How does it work?

TRON is big on becoming an ecosystem with a wide range of participants who should be able to reap various benefits. Any participant who makes at least some effort in developing this ecosystem should be rewarded for it, regardless of their role in it. With this in mind, TRON was developed to offer both Bitcoin and Ethereum for their money with some of its main features:

* **TRON** wants to position itself as the most flexible and light option for the implementation of the smart contract. The ***TRON Virtual Machine (TVM)*** is compatible with the ***Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)***, with planned support for several other VMs in the future. This should ensure that the distribution of customized applications and wallets on the TRON platform is done more flexibly. TRON's smart contract engine promotes effectiveness, is built around a lighter architecture and supports collaboration with more users. TRX transfers and running smart contracts actually cost points of bandwidth rather than tokens. Therefore, implementing a DApp on the TRON network should allow developers to benefit from lower development costs based on TRON TVM's bandwidth settings. At the same time, they should have direct access to various users who are looking for influencers, investment channels, and new business ideas. 
*  **TRON** focuses on three ""maxima"" as its overall goals in platform development: high productivity, high availability and high performance. The TRON team combines the promise of solving scalability problems with the prospect of having more transactions per second (TPS) than its competitors in everyday use. At the moment, the TRON is known as being able to handle **2000 TPS** at any time of the day. Believing that performance should not come at the expense of platform availability, the TRON team promises to offer a network infrastructure capable of supporting a higher level of decentralization and a stimulating reward distribution mechanism. 
*  **TRON** aims to redefine the dominant practices in the content distribution and entertainment industries. The stated goal is to remove middlemen from the content creation process and reduce its dependence on network resources controlled by large corporations. With TRON, content creators should be paid directly by the audience they serve, without resorting to the services of various intermediaries such as content distribution platforms. At the same time, giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon would be robbed of some of their monopoly powers, at least in the field of monetizing traffic and user data. TRON wants to use the blockchain as the basis of the future global content sharing system. With the promise of rewards for content creators participating in its ecosystem, TRON hopes to expand its reach and employ its peer-to-peer (P2P) networking technology to become a global storage operating system. and unlimited data uploads of all kinds. This includes popular formats such as audio and video content, but also in-game currencies, which should be made available for distribution without restrictions. 

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallets for TRX are TronLinkWallet, TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice. 

# Pros&Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. Development in the entertainment sector
2. Great devs team
3. High TPS (2000)

**Cons**

1. More than half of TRX tokens on the crypto market are kept in ten addresses. 
2. It doesn't have a working product (blockchain excluded)

TRX,cryptocurrency,Finally sold out of XRP and TRX,"Finally decided to just sell at a loss, I bought in 2018 when they where both close to ATH. I saw the boom in media and FOMO'ed in. Thankfully I put 70% of my investment in ETH, 15% in TRX and 15% in XRP. And as you probably know, I got burned pretty bad on those alts (up overall though, thanks to the latest ETH change)

Though I still believe TRX have some value in the future, it's not really the development I want to support (Gambling, gaming etc). And these two coins have so much pump & dump and suspicious activity...I'm just done.

With a lot more experience and actually did some research I got me some ADA and LINK instead. Couldn't be more happy with my alt choice's. The future will tell if I have a reason to be happy :D

TRX,cryptocurrency,Why Tron (TRX)? Why All The Hate Without Reason? Is this a Case of Tron Leprosy? An Attempt At Civil Discord.,"Why are people so quick to dismiss Tron without giving a reason? I have been a holder of TRX since the very beginning and sold 40% at an average of .25. I did very well and still hold a sizable bag. Since the beginning I have been impressed with the background and leadership of Justin Sun, the team members he is assembling, the weekly progress, and the overall utility of TRX. I even like the puppy game because it is a proof of concept. I have personally transferred TRX from MyEtherWallet to tron.game.com.  I purchased a Tron puppy from another TRX holder on the TRX blockchain using the TRX coin - it worked very well.  Can you say that about all the coins you hold?  Have you seen their list of partnerships with channels that provide ten-of-millions of users?

I am all for an open discussion as to why a token may or may not be worthy to hold. I am a long time Ripple holder and appreciate both the positive and negative arguments when thinking about my position. When people say they do not like Ripple, it normally comes with a list of reasons I have come to understand.  For example, those who do not like Ripple argue XRP is not necessarily de-centralized, and I agree with this argument. 

However, with TRX there does not seem to be a civil discourse. People have stopped reading my articles simply at the mention of Tron - with no reason.  They just dismiss my entire article because Tron was mentioned in it, and do not even give a reason. It is as if those who support Tron are just shunned out of shear stupidity for owning TRX by the greater crypto community.  Is this a case of Tron leprosy? 

In an attempt to have civil conversation, if you support TRX, like I do, what is your strongest argument for Tron? If you hate TRX, please state your reason(s) why with some reason and facts to back them up that a crypto investor would find meaningful.  Just telling me you stopped reading my article and think I am a fool for the mere mention of Tron does not help me.  

Give me a reason(s) why Tron, currently, the 16th largest coin, is not worth holding and why you do not think it will be a higher price 3, 6, or 12 months from now.   Please be specific.  ",0,2018-02-23 21:44:27,75

The app has paid out over 30k TRX in it's month long beta.

This is an investment free app that will earn you TRX.

How it works: It is fully ad supported, users simply have to log in, play some free games and collect their TRX. The pool is loaded with the ad revenue and users collect shares from checking in, watching video ads, and playing games. These shares give you a share of the ad revenue paid once monthly. The pool grows as more users play games as losses feed the pool and the lottery system. The games offer trx prizes for instant TRX.

**Updates since beta:**

New chance based game where you bet TRX for a chance to possibly double it.

Smaller ads for better UI on certain screens.

Lotto system, every 7 daily logins rewards you with 1 lotto ticket, there will be 3 winners per month who split the pot which starts at 5000 trx. Losing the games will fund the lotto pot so it will grow all month until the draw. The jackpot on the number game rewards 1 lotto ticket now as well.

Pool is now fed by both ad rev, and people playing games as losses are added to the pool. The pool will be huge by end of each month.

**Things that are coming:**

Referral system, PvP games where users stake TRX and the winner takes all.

# Introduction

Hello crypto enthusiasts,

Thank you very much for reading Part 1 and providing a lot of useful comments for the series. One of the most requested feature for the documents is the inclusion of altcoins. We will get to that point soon! But before that, I want to address one specific comment made by u/J-Lannister [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16eqmck/comment/jzxz7ig/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

>A for effort, F for strategy though.  
>  
>Don't rebalance. Let winners ride until the height of the bull-run. Messing about with selling and rebalancing is anti-thetical to the DCA strategy in itself (set and forget).

Apparently, not everyone is convinced about the benefit of constant rebalancing itself, favoring a simple set and forget approach. Not only that, there is also the notion of ""let winners ride until the height of the bull-run"", meaning that people can be afraid of selling the coin that is rising to buying the coin that is falling. So today, let's dive deep into the data to understand **why rebalancing is an extremely beneficial strategy that very worth the effort, especially if you have high amount of capital**.

# What is rebalancing again? 🔄

[Varying the allocation allows you to control the desired volatility while tilting towards the coin you believe in more.](https://preview.redd.it/g5r69tphlxob1.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=12afaaf6783df1a6c97f7e791e115ceff7942565)

By now, you must already be familiar with the [benefit of diversification from part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16eqmck/prep_for_the_bull_run_pt_1_eth_btc_allocation/). As you can see above, varying the allocation allows for reducing volatility, while allowing you to avoid the performance of worst coin. However, due to the different performances of different coins at different time, a DCA strategy on its own can create a style drift. A 50/50 portfolio occasionally drifts to 60/40, or 40/60, when one coins outperform or underperform the other at certain times.

[Constantly putting the same investment at 50\/50 can create style drift overtime.](https://preview.redd.it/ekv09opnkxob1.png?width=1460&format=png&auto=webp&s=b70416634a6cdf8daa9d93932bc636f378d3320a)

Rebalancing refers to the fact that not only do we keep buying coins in a diversified manner, we also buy the coins in such a way that recovers your originally intended asset allocation. For example. at the time of buying new coins, the current portfolio of the person is:

* BTC: $490
* ETH: $510

When new $100 comes in, we will buy $60 BTC and $40 ETH to keep the allocation 50/50 (as both sides now have $550). By buying more of the lower-valued asset and less of a higher-valued asset, what you are doing is effectively buying low selling high and gaining a small profit. Taking profit to secure gain is a motto heavily preached this sub. By doing rebalancing, you are effectively doin this week in, week out at smaller scale!

What if the style drift is so big that even a $100 on the lower-performing asset cannot restore the allocation? In that case, investors will have to sell a bit of the higher-performing assets. For example, if the investor currently has the following portfolio.

* BTC: $400
* ETH: $600

In this case, we will have to sell $50 ETH, and buy $150 BTC to keep the portfolio balanced. As you can see, the resulting allocation is far more stable, as it essentially resets to 50/50 at the beginning of each investment period.

[You can ensure no style drift if you consistently rebalance](https://preview.redd.it/67u1dzftkxob1.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=c330b2a657c4f4195a040b11b430656c19c03fa7)

|Portfolio|Total Invested ($)|Total Value ($)|Total Return ($)|Total Return Percentage|Maximum Drawdown (%)|Portfolio Volatility (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**100% BTC**|$7,100.00|$11,922.70|$4,822.70|67.93%|\-52.41%|6.45%|
|**50/50**|$7,100.00|$13,657.40|$6,557.40|92.36%|\-56.38%|6.08%|
|**50/50 (Rebalance)**|**$7100.0**|**$14104.48**|**$7004.48**|**98.65%**|**-56.83%**|**6.14%**|
|**100% ETH**|$7,100.00|$15,392.11|$8,292.11|116.79%|\-61.02%|6.44%|

The overall 50/50 portfolio has an increase in return of 6.29%, an entire year worth of stock return!

This not only applies to the 50/50 portfolio, but to all asset allocation. By drawing out a non-rebalancing (blue) vs. a rebalancing (red) portfolio, we can see shift in the ""Volatility vs. Return frontier graph"" as below.

https://preview.redd.it/wcilpueolxob1.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=55591edd0f73586ee05dbd57a79ee48625e0aff2

As you can see, the act of rebalancing helps with return of all asset allocation of BTC and ETH! The shifting effect is obviously the biggest at 50/50, but you receive benefits for other asset allocation too. Now, in this specific case, you do have a slightly higher volatility for each portfolio, but they are still lower than either single-coin portfolio.

# Rebalancing is even more crucial for alt-coins 🪙🚀

Now, you might look at this and tell me: If it is just 6% of extra return, is it really worth the hassle? What this doesn't show you is that the benefit of diversification and rebalancing varies depending on how uncorrelated the pair of asset is. **The more uncorrelated the asset prices, the greater the benefit of diversification**

For example, let's look at the pair of BTC / BNB.

[BTC \/ BNB pair](https://preview.redd.it/mtfkggerlxob1.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=36a25e2049da4952d95b98250a42d3b2b8fca313)

Here, we truly see the benefit of rebalancing shines.

* Not only that rebalancing increases return, but **you sometimes have both increasing return and decreasing volatility.**
* **Rebalancing allows certain allocation to actually have higher return than single-coin portfolio.** As you can see, a mix of BTC 20% and BNB 80% portfolio actually has a higher total return than a 100% BNB portfolio, even though BNB performs better than BTC. This is the magic of rebalancing!

The benefit is so extreme for some asset pair that it outright converts a losing strategy into a winning one. Consider a pair of BNB and HBAR.

[BNB \/ HBAR: Free 20&#37; return just from rebalancing](https://preview.redd.it/xbmes3szlxob1.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=84f0c202cea57f74bf657334626118a276f2aa41)

As you can see, a 50/50 BNB/HBAR portfolio without balancing barely performs better than a 100% BNB portfolio, with a small extra return of 7%, while not even having lower volatility. However, with balancing, a 50/50 BNB/HBAR becomes the best performing portfolio, earning a whopping extra 20% return. Think about it, **just the act of rebalancing alone gives you one third of the return of your portfolio**!!

How about another extreme example of VET / THETA pair. The act of rebalancing can give a whopping 100% additional return with lower portfolio! In a bear market that is already hard to make money, a 100% return for a little bit more work doesn't sound too shabby eh?

[VET \/ THETA pair. Almost 100&#37; additional return](https://preview.redd.it/lxhnna06mxob1.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=2608bcfd547430f4e806039fca6d5b246e2d1788)

**Even when rebalancing does not provide higher return, it still makes the benefit of reducing volatility much more justifiable**. Consider the following pair of BTC and ALGO. Without rebalancing, any allocation towards BTC incurs a significant loss in return for lower volatility. But with rebalancing, any allocation between BTC 40% / ALGO 60% and BTC 0% / ALGO 100% now have very similar returns. **Rebalancing allows you to have a much bigger margin of error in your initial asset allocation**

[BTC \/ ALGO Pair](https://preview.redd.it/y98klf2amxob1.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=db31ede944012744f60e24748ac0060fedb876b2)

How about a few more pairs?

You get the idea!

# Is there any downside to rebalancing? 📉

Now, it has to be said that rebalancing does not guarantee you either benefit of increasing return or decreasing volatility. This is because there is an inherent risk that at the tail end of a period, you consistently buy into a ever decreasing and volatile asset, without it having enough to catch up for rebalancing to generate the buy low sell high effect. Considering the following pair of BNB and XML. As you can see below, this pair consistently have lower return in all asset allocation. This got worse for and allocation from BNB 30%, XLM 70% to XLM 100%. They got both **worsened volatility and lower return**. Now, it should be noted that when this happened, the loss of return doesn't appear to be extreme, compared to the much more extreme gain that we often observed when the opposite happen.

https://preview.redd.it/9i9ddkvsmxob1.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff8beea90d307468aacedef0a78280617184f1ab

# So, how often does it help really? 🤔

As with any form of investing, it is impossible to know the future. There is no such thing as a guaranteed 100% winning strategy. However, there is such a thing as a well-informed strategy, where you increase the likelihood of winning. The same is true for rebalancing. We cannot know the optimal allocation now, but we can learn from the past of how likely rebalancing will help, and what is its benefit. The only way we can find out about this is to map out **every single pair of coin at every single allocation down to 1%, and investigate its return**.

For this exercise, I chose a list of coins consisting of `'BTC', 'ETH', 'BNB', 'XRP', 'DOGE', 'ADA', 'MATIC', 'LTC', 'TRX', 'XMR', 'ATOM', 'ETC', 'BCH', 'XLM', 'ALGO', 'VET', 'EOS', 'HBAR', 'THETA'`. One can accuse me of cherry picking coins. To this, I would like to reply that this list of coin itself is fairly representative of the market back in 2017, and that the limitation is purely due to the dataset that I have. If you have a bigger list of coin, I would gladly update the study to reflect the new dataset.

With a total of 17,271 portfolio simulations, the result is as following:

* **Average increase in return:** 6.16%
* **Average reduction in volatility:** 0.00% (Negligible)

||Smaller Return|Greater return|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Greater volatility|1057|5542|
|Smaller volatility|3043|7287|
||**24.22%**|**75.78%**|

&#x200B;

||Return difference|Volatility difference|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Greater Return, Smaller Volatility|9.52%|\-0.06%|
|Smaller Return, Smaller Volatility|\-5.98%|\-0.05%|
|Greater Return, Greater Volatility|10.40%|0.11%|
|Smaller Return, Greater Volatility|\-2.22%|0.03%|

When you do rebalancing, you increase 6.2% total return on average. There is **three in four chance** that you gain, and when you gain, you gain much more than when you lose.

If you only consider the 50/50 portfolio to maximize the rebalancing effect, the difference is even more extreme:

* **Average Difference in Return:** 9.41%
* **Average Difference in Volatility:** \-0.01%

||Smaller Return|Greater return|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Greater volatility|8|52|
|Smaller volatility|33|78|
||**23.98%**|**76.02%**|

&#x200B;

||Return difference|Volatility difference|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Greater Return, Smaller Volatility|13.67%|\-0.09%|
|Smaller Return, Smaller Volatility|\-8.89%|\-0.08%|
|Greater Return, Greater Volatility|16.40%|0.16%|
|Smaller Return, Greater Volatility|\-2.04%|0.03%|

**So whenever you rebalance, you have 3 out of 4 chance of increasing your portfolio. You gain 6.2% to 9.41% return on average with virtually the same volatility reduction benefits.** 🚀🚀🚀 Who wouldn't like that?

# Okay, I am sold of rebalancing. How do I actually execute this strategy? 💼

Fear not, I have prepared a simple Python script for you. Simply specify your allocation and your current portfolio in the following script, and the script will automatically print out the amount that you should contribute towards each coin for you!

    def calculate_contribution(portfolio, target_ratio, contribution):
        total_amount = sum(portfolio.values())
        target_values = {asset: (total_amount + contribution) * target_ratio[asset] for asset in portfolio}
        print(target_values)
    
        contributions = {}
        for asset, value in target_values.items():
            additional_contribution = value - portfolio[asset]
            asset_contribution = additional_contribution - contribution * target_ratio[asset] / total_amount
            contributions[asset] = asset_contribution
    
        return contributions
    
    portfolio = {'BTC': 1050, 'ETH': 950} # Current portfolio
    target_ratio = {'BTC': 0.5, 'ETH': 0.5} # Target portfolio
    contribution = 500 # Additional contribution amount
    
    contributions = calculate_contribution(portfolio, target_ratio, contribution) 
    for asset, amount in contributions.items(): 
        print(f""You should contribute {amount} to {asset} to match the target allocation."")

# Wait, what about taxes? 💰 And what about having three or more coins? 📊

Yes, when you buy low sell high frequently, you potentially incur some tax. And yes, having three or more coins allows even more opportunity of buying low and selling high at smaller scale, as you would expect different movements between the three coins. However, having multiple coins also create more tax complications, as tracking assets become more difficult.

We will explore the topic of tax efficiency next week, as there are ways to perform rebalancing and structuring your portfolio with tax efficiency in mind. But for now, if you already have a pair of coins that you would like to DCA long-term, please feel free to do it now, knowing that if you gain any benefit from rebalancing, **you will most likely not be taxed so much that you would wipe out all the gains you had from rebalancing**. And, if you just don't want to deal with tax at all, **just don't sell and buy the lower valued coin when perform rebalancing**.

TRX,cryptocurrency,Tron (TRX) staking: Bandwidth vs Energy,"So when freeze Tron (TRX) to stake you get this option.

Bandwidth or Energy

# Bandwidth: 

Having TRON bandwidth allows you to **perform transactions on the TRON mainnet without paying any gas/transaction fees.** Bandwidth is also used to cement yourself as an active member of the TRON community, allowing you to cast votes for Super Representatives. 

Note this is only outgoing gas fees. Any gas fees from other wallets to yours isn't counted. 

&#x200B;

#  Energy:

This is a special resource **used to process smart contracts on the TRON network.** Smart contracts consume Energy in addition to Bandwidth 

\_\_\_\_\_

# Note about freezing/locking:

Freezing coins is basically where you lock given coins to a wallet address for a given time. This prevents you from moving the coins, selling, and so on while frozen/locked. After a given time you can unfreeze/unlock the coins and do whatever with them. But note normally this means you also lose any staking ability with those coins. 

For Tron it's a 3 day freeze before being able to unfreeze. After which point you can unfreeze at any point or leave it freeze for staking. You should be able to start staking right away when you freeze your coins.

For any coin, note the restrictions.

&#x200B;

**Side note:** some coins use different terms. For example, Dot uses ""bonding"" instead of calling it freezing or locking. But it all means the same. Just note on some coins like Dot there is restrictions before you can lock the coins and then restrictions on when you can stake it. For Dot it changes, but it's 10 coins to bond, and about 100-150 to start staking. 

However, note some coins like Tron doesn't have restrictions.",0,2022-08-21 16:25:44,14

I bought the TRX a while ago using paybis, which is super high fees, so i don't want to go that route. The TRX is onchain (not wrapped or on an exhange) in my trustwallet. 

My goal is simply: sell TRX for BSC (binance smart chain) .

That way i can use the BSC to buy other coins on the Bsc network.

I would rather not transfer to a big exchange if i can swap the TRX on something like pancakeswap (which i don't think take non BSC assets), but i don't know how to do a swap of assets across chains like this.

TRX,cryptocurrency,The very logic explanation of Etoro delisting news for ADA and TRX for US clients:,"https://www.etoro.com/en-us/news-and-analysis/etoro-updates/important-update-regarding-ada-and-trx/

1) it has nothing to do with the Howey test as Digital Aset News speculated here: [https://youtu.be/EvCzRpetyOQ](https://youtu.be/EvCzRpetyOQ)

Because XRP is also available to trade on Etoro for US clients.

And ADA and TRX are not even on the list here [https://www.cryptoratingcouncil.com/asset-ratings](https://www.cryptoratingcouncil.com/asset-ratings) that could be securities where XRP has a 4.o rating.   
ALGO has a 2.0 rating and is much more centralized as ADA.   


Charles has confirmed here: [https://youtu.be/WYQTkf8ndpY](https://youtu.be/WYQTkf8ndpY) that *""we've never received any regulatory summons or subpoena or any of these things everything's fine cardano's fine""*

so it is reasonable to believe that the same is valid for Tron. 

2) its related to the new law shuffled in the Infrastructure Bill just signed by Biden that goes in to effect 2023. 

(2 new bill proposals will give next year clarity on this KYC regarding staking.)

 Etoro also offers DOT, SOL, ALGO for trading but not for staking,

Etoro offered up till now :

*""Which coins can I stake?*

*eToro  currently supports staking for Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX), and is  working on plans to support more cryptoassets in the future.""*

[https://www.etoro.com/en-us/crypto/staking/](https://www.etoro.com/en-us/crypto/staking/)

The easiest thing would be that Etoro just stops offering staking.

But all Etoro clients that were staking ADA and TRX have a contract. I guess its legally not that simple for them to just stop that and they decided it would be easier to just delist ALL the coins they offer for staking. 

The clients can move their coins to the Etoro wallet for the time being, until they have solved the issue to offer again these 2 coins for trading but without staking.

Only the Etoro wallet is up till now not compatible with others to transfer your coins. And for some, tax reasons, selling and buying back elsewhere is also not the solution. The IRS will just count this a sell order. 

It just shows, that ""NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS"" again is the truth. 

Charles asks also the Cardano foundation, members of them who also manages the subreddit Cardano, *""it's become clear to me that perhaps there's a better way of communicating strategies and processes and that can be a kpi for 2022 for the foundation to pursue""*",20,2021-11-23 22:08:39,19

TRX,cryptocurrency,Hardware wallets explained,"Hardware wallets are, without a doubt, the most secure way to store your crypto. Yet, at first, they can be rather confusing and I have certainly seen a lot of misconceptions around them in some posts. This guide is structured as a FAQ so you can jump to the sections of interest. Please do let me know of any feedback or further questions in the comments and I will be happy to update the guide.

# What’s a crypto wallet anyway?

A crypto wallet is essentially just a set of keys which identify you on the blockchain. The blockchain holds the ledger of all the transactions (entered by the miners or validators) hence it has at all times a record of where all the coins are. Thus, your wallet never really stores any coin. The coins are stored by the blockchain and your wallet simply contains the keys that let you prove the ownership of these coins. The wallet stores two types of keys:

**Public key:** this is the address you use to receive your crypto, it is publicly available and can be shared safely.

**Private key:** this is the key you need to use to prove ownership of the coins i.e. to sign transactions when you move your coins around or withdraw them from your wallet. It is generated from the seed phrase (usually 12 word or 24-words).

It is important to stress that, essentially, **the seed phrase IS the wallet**. This is because the seed phrase generates the private key which is the only way to prove ownership of the coins. Whoever learns this seed phrase can claim ownership of your portfolio and, on the contrary, if you forget this seed phrase you might end up locked out of your wallet forever. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cfd6b3hj3px61.png?width=326&format=png&auto=webp&s=c88211047277e47c1bed51e20908e47564209df0

# What are the different types of wallet ?

**Mobile/Desktop wallet:** there are many desktop or mobile softwares that act as crypto wallets (e.g. Exodus, Atomic, Trust, Metamask,…). Those wallets are referred to as hot wallet because they are constantly connected to the internet. Whilst these are certainly the most convenient, their major drawback is that **they are the most vulnerable to security threats**. This is because your private key is stored on the computer or mobile phone which can be targeted by a malware, sim hack, key logger,…

**Paper wallet:** a paper wallet is simply a piece of paper where your keys have been printed, along with a QR code to scan to authenticate transactions. This is considered secure because it is removed from the internet. The only way to ‘hack’ it is to steal the sheet of paper.

**Hardware wallet:** a hardware wallet is a device, specifically designed to hold your private keys. It is another example of ‘cold storage’ meaning that it does not connect to the internet. You only have to plug it to confirm transactions, the private keys never leave the device. It is the most secure way to store your crypto but more on that later.

# Why not simply leave my coins on the exchange ?

Leaving your coins on the exchange where you just bought them is easy and convenient but not the safest practice. When you create an account with an exchange, it creates a wallet on your behalf. This means that, when you leave your coins at the exchange, you entrust them with your private keys and as the saying goes **“not your keys, not your coins”**. Many exchanges have been hacked (e.g. Altsbit, Upbit, Mt. Gox to name just a few and even Binance in May 2019) and in that case, it is almost impossible to recover the stolen funds. In some cases, there is also the risk that a government ban would freeze cryptocurrency transactions preventing you from accessing your coins.

Having said that, some reputable exchanges, such as Coinbase, do invest a lot in their security and you need to consider whether you trust your own security measures more than theirs. Additionally, if you decide to store your crypto in your own wallet, you need to be confident that you will not lose your keys. It is estimated that **more than 20% of all the bitcoins have been lost forever**, mostly as a result of lost or forgotten keys. 

All this needs to be taken into account when assessing your personal decision but, it is generally considered that, for significant sums and/or for long term storage, a hardware wallet is the safest route.

&#x200B;

[In 2014, around 850,000 bitcoins were stolen from the exchange Mt. Gox](https://preview.redd.it/y1xvhfg75px61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ca3ecea7eb47b7983ff14fa340aa2b543b63526)

# How does a hardware wallet work ? Why is it safe ?

A hardware wallet is designed to perform only a very limited set of tasks: it holds the private key and can be asked to confirm transaction using that key. It cannot connect to the internet and cannot prepare the transactions by itself. For this reason, it needs to be connected to a computer running a software, called a bridge, in order to prepare the transactions for the hardware wallet to sign. It is the safest way to store your crypto for several reasons:

* The operating system that runs the hardware wallet is extremely specific, unlike the one on a computer or a mobile phone. For this reason, it is immune to malware.
* It does not connect to the internet so it cannot be targeted by an attack.
* The private keys never leave the wallet so they are never exposed to a potential thief even if your computer has been compromised.
* Some hardware wallets use extra layers of security such as pin code, passphrase to protect against specific risks. See the next sections for more details.

# What if my hardware wallet is lost or stolen?

If you lose your hardware wallet, simply use your seed phrase in any type of wallet (new hardware device or software wallet). Your private key will be re-generated and you will regain access to your funds. Then, because this private key is now probably compromised, you want to buy a new hardware wallet, obtain a brand new seed phrase and transfer your crypto to this new wallet.

# What if my hardware wallet is broken?

Same answer as above. As long as you have the seed phrase, you can always recover the wallet.

# What if the manufacturer of my hardware wallet goes out of business?

Same answer as above again except that you would buy a hardware wallet from a different brand. Most manufacturers will share the same seed phrase technology, thus the private key can be re-generated in a wallet from a different brand or even in a software wallet if need be.

# Can hardware wallets be hacked ?

**Physically stolen device**

It is possible for a hacker to extract the private keys from a hardware wallet but only if the wallet is physically stolen first. If your device does get lost or stolen, it is more likely that you will be able to restore the wallet in a different application using the seed phrase and transfer the funds to a brand new wallet before your device falls in the hands of a hacker skilled enough to extract the keys.

**5$ wrench attack**

Another type of possible theft is the less refined so-called 5$ wrench attack. This is the case where someone, possibly armed with a wrench, physically threatens you until you release your seed phrase. Obviously, the best way to protect yourself against this kind of threat is not to talk about your crypto portfolio but hardware wallet can also help. Some hardware wallet allow you to choose a **passphrase** which acts like an extra word that you choose to add to your seed phrase. This way, a single wallet can hold a default portfolio (the one with no passphrase) and multiple hidden portfolios (one for each passphrase you choose). If you are forced to reveal your seed phrase under duress, you could give access to a decoy portfolio which holds a small amount of crypto without having to reveal your other portfolio since there is no way to know how many hidden portfolio have been included in the wallet.

&#x200B;

# Watch out for hardware wallet scams

When you decide to acquire a hardware wallet, you need to be very careful to buy a device that has not been compromised. Indeed, a widespread scam when it comes to hardware wallets consists in selling devices that have been previously tampered with. To avoid that, it is highly recommended to buy your device directly from the manufacturer website such as [https://trezor.io](https://trezor.io) or [https://www.ledger.com](https://www.ledger.com) instead of going through third-party sellers such as Ebay. When you do receive your device, you need to make sure it is genuine and has not been tampered with, you follow the steps described [here for Trezor](https://blog.trezor.io/psa-non-genuine-trezor-devices-979b64e359a7) and [here for Ledger](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002481534-Check-if-device-is-genuine).

A notable type of scam is the case where you receive a wallet that has already been preconfigured i.e. the seed phrase is already printed on a sheet or even a scratch card that you receive along with the device. This is a scam where the scammer already knows your private key and would have control over any fund you transfer into the wallet. **The seed phrase should always be generated for the first time when you perform the initial set up of the device yourself.**

&#x200B;

[A hardware wallet received with a pre-configured seed phrase is always a scam](https://preview.redd.it/bssnpbhn0px61.png?width=296&format=png&auto=webp&s=65b57ba2a75ab4f201be2fca1e269843a380a637)

# Which wallet should I buy?

So, you’re convinced, you need a hardware wallet, but which one should you get? Below is a comparison table of the most common hardware wallets so you can make an informed decision. They all have their pros and cons but the most important is that you can’t go wrong with any of them.

&#x200B;

[Comparison table of the leading hardware wallets](https://preview.redd.it/cii501fxwox61.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=60129c5f8ec224220aa48c423e5d6bee11c1b602)

**\*Touchscreen:** this is an extra layer of security because it avoids having to type anything in the computer which is more vulnerable to security threats such as a key logger.

**\*Passphrase**: this is the feature that lets you create hidden wallets within the device.

**\*Pin code**: upon entering multiple incorrect pins, the device wipes itself such that the private keys are erased and can only be restored using the seed phrase.

&#x200B;

[Trezor One and Model T](https://preview.redd.it/6sa2vq9x1px61.png?width=559&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c51beb1af81f2f52f3297707d812d059ef62423)

# I heard Ledger was hacked, what’s up with that?

In 2020, Ledger company customers information were stolen. The actual ledger devices were not compromised and no coin were directly stolen. However, customer informations, including over a million email addresses as well as 270k home addresses and phone number, were made publicly available by hackers. This led to widespread phishing attempts whereby ledger customers were asked to download a fake version of Ledger live and input their seed phrase. Moreover, home addresses and phone numbers in the hands of hackers also led to personalised email threats as well as potential sim swap attack which could be used to overcome two-factor authentication.

Consequently, even when using a hardware wallet, it is important to **follow best practice in terms of security**: ignore email scams, be on the lookout for phishing attempt, use authenticator app as 2FA, keep your seed phrase secure ideally in a rented safety box, …

# I want to stake my coins, can I still store them on a hardware wallet?

Some coins can be staked directly from the hardware wallet allowing you to earn interest on your crypto in total security. This is the list at the time of writing so far as I am aware.

**Ledger Nano X:**

* Polkadot (DOT): Ledger Live
* Cosmos (ATOM): Ledger Live
* Tezos (XTZ): Ledger Live
* Tron (TRX): Ledger Live
* Algorand (ALGO): Ledger Live
* Cardano (ADA): Yoroi, Adalite
* Harmony (ONE): Harmony One wallet

**Trezor model T:**

* Cardano (ADA): Yoroi, Adalite. 
* Tezos (XTZ): Trezor wallet

A step-by-step guide to staking ADA from a hardware wallet can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n1p1ae/cardano_step_by_step_guide_to_staking_ada/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

No. The private keys is not required to receive coins. The coins are sent to your public address and this transaction is recorded in the blockchain ledger. You will only need to plug the hardware wallet to prove ownership of the coins if you decide to spend them.

# Any other best practice tip I should be aware of when setting up my hardware wallet ?

The first time you set up your hardware wallet, it is important to **practice disaster recovery.** After a few years using your device, it will likely be lost or fail and you need to be confident that you can recover your wallet. Thus, after the initial set up and after you have copied your seed phrase, send a very small amount of crypto to the wallet and wipe the device clean with a hard factory reset. Then, re-initialise the device using the seed phrase to recover the wallet. This makes sure you have correctly copied the seed phrase and gives you confidence you will be able to deal with the loss or failure of the device in the future.",1080,2021-05-07 13:08:43,223
TRX,cryptocurrency,Isn't It A Form Of Hypocrisy To Bash Crypto That Relies on Hype (i.e. EOS or TRX)?,"so, i see a lot of tribal mentalism here within the crypto community such as those who like to bash certain projects like EOS or TRX or BTT, whatever. Personally, I don't take side but I think it's an extreme hypocrisy to say 'this coin went up only because of hype', etc.

Why? Here's why. because the whole crypto industry relies on hype. there's no demand outside speculation perspective. even those who believe in cryptocurrencies admitted 2017 price went up fueled by ICOs and theory of greater fools.

When there's no real demand for cryptocurrencies but speculation that in the future this thing will ever go mainstream, isn't it actually a form of hypocrisy to call out alts that rely on hype? Because whether you like it or not, coins like XRP, ETH, and BTC themselves rely on hype",21,2019-02-07 22:52:56,42
TRX,cryptocurrency,"Crypto influencer ""Soulja Boy"" ordered to pay $45,784 by the SEC for promoting Justin Sun's Tron and BitTorrent tokens","Hip-hop star Soulja Boy has promoted crypto many times on Twitter (5.2 million followers) and other social media channels.

TRX,cryptocurrency,Let's Play Devils Advocate And List The Reasons That You Believe Each Coin Is Overhyped/Priced,"The best way to find great investments is to start with the belief that the investment is doomed, then try to find the reasons proving that statement wrong.

For example on the last daily discussion one of the top comments was ""buy coin x"" with the only reason being ""i'll change the world""

**Rules:** 

* Top level comments are the names of coins (I will start with a few but please add more)
* Comments under the top levels are the devils advocate, commenting on the problems with the coin/concept and why it may be overpriced 
* The most valid criticisms should be upvoted even if you disagree with them
* Replies to those comments may be rebuttals and counterpoints again advocating for the coin

TRX,cryptocurrency,Why only sign send trx and not receive trx?,"So I got a scam coin send to my pristine long term storage (hardware wallet) address and I hate it.

Of course, I cannot remove it. It will stay there forever. I can create a new wallet / address and transfer my coins to it but how long and it gets scam (spam) coins too?

I feel there is a need to prevent scam (and doxing tokens for that matter) to be send to my address without consent.

I might be wrong but isn't that a flaw in the general blockchain design?

Wouldn't it be better if a transaction needs to be signed by sender AND by receiver?

I. e. the bridge / wallet software could pop up a notification that X wants to send me stuff and I can verify it before it is ""carved in stone""?

This would of course require a transient 'message queue' layer (shard?) a bridge / wallet software can subscribe to.

In case the receiver denies / fails to sign the transaction (e.g. within 24 hours), the transactions is discarded (gas for message queue usage is payed by the sender only).

If the receiver signs the transaction as well, it goes on to be added to a block as usual.

It would also nice to be able to add addresses to an 'allow' address list to auto confirm repeating transfers from specific addresses.

Thoughts?

#  Smart Contract Blockchain Platform

## Ethereum (ETH):
Ethereum was the first of it's kind, at least, the first to successfully make a large blockchain platform that successfully deploys and runs smart contracts while also handling millions of transactions a day. (Running a smart contract is also considered a transaction.  As of today, Ethereum has managed to put out 1.303 million transactions and there are over 3000 decentralized applications (dApps, https://www.stateofthedapps.com/platforms/ethereum)


With those transactions in mind, Ethereum has an issue on its hands and you can guess it. Gas. Gas is the method for which the entire blockchain runs. Imagine your car, you need gas to crank it and drive it. Same thing you need gas to send transactions. Why is this? This is due to to the Proof of Work protocol that allows for these transactions to be done. I won't go into the nitty gritty. But basically, you're paying the miners to process your transaction.

## Cardano (ADA):
Cardano is developing a smart contract platform on their blockchain technology. Supposedly it will be more feature-rich than Ethereum. However, the biggest difference between Cardano and Ethereum is that Cardano utilizes a newer concept known as Proof of Stake. Proof of stake basically has members who hold a specific token the ability to stake their tokens into a stake pool so that the representing server of that pool may process transactions and earn rewards. Those rewards are then dispersed to the members staking their funds. (Expecting personal attacks for mentioning this name, but this is how the Tron (TRX) network runs).

Literally not much else to be said at this point, until Cardano releases Smart Contracts and their documentation and mission proves friendly enough for developers. We can't speculate whether it's a better platform than Ethereum. 

With ETH 2.0 expecting to come out next year, there will not be much difference between these two except for how their governance works and how their Proof-of-Stake works. With this in mind, what matters is the community between these two and which platform provides better documentation for the community and big organizations to be able to developer their own decentralized applications on.



# Internet of Blockchains

## Polkadot (DOT)

Polkadot's main goal is to utilize a relay chain to coordinate the system and the Parachains. Parachains are the platforms which will be built by other development teams to create their own blockchains ON the DOT platform. For example, if Ethereum were in the development stages of OG Ethereum, then they may have considered developing Ethereum on DOT  so that some features were already handled (such as security and communications between other blockchains.) 

You can not run a Smart Contract on DOT's network. The relay chain was deliberately minimized in functionality so that it could focus on the main components of DOT. However, there are Ethereum competitors known as Ink!, Moonbeam, and Edgeware that will be coming out on the DOT platform as Smart Contract Parachains (blockchains.)

Validators are basically servers producing blocks on the Relay chain and they receive staking rewards for producing them.

Collators are nodes on both a Parachain and a relay chain, they collect transactions and produce state transition proofs for the validators to accept. Also are the method of communication between blockchains through XCMP (cross-chain message passing)


##  Cosmos (ATOM)

Cosmos main focus is Internet of Blockchains but is a tad different in how they want to interact with these blockchains compared to DOT. Seems more like ATOM wants to compete with Smart Contracts by allowing Application-Specific Blockchains. It looks like they are trying to attempt this by allowing developers to develop a blockchain that is customized to operate a single dApp. I don't fully understand how they plan to do this. I'll come back and edit this section in the morning.


The main goal of Cosmos however is still to allow developers to create blockchains on top of Tendermint (cosmos default consensus engine) so that they can interoperate with one another. The main difference between DOT and ATOM is that DOT will be more specific about how you can create your blockchain in order for it to operate on the DOT network. ATOM has more freedom for the developer.


I'm always welcome to criticism. 


Edit:


Some people misinterpreted my poorly worded mention of TRX to mean that the network of ADA through PoS would cause more network attacks. I really meant that I expected the sub to blast me for mentioning Trons name

Edit 2:
Guys this is an overview of the projects and who they are contending with. This is not supposed to be an in-depth post explaining how each one of them differentiate themselves from their competition.

TRX,cryptocurrency,Something fishy is going on with the Tron Accelerator $1m developer contest,"[Tron Accelerator](https://tronaccelerator.io/) is (allegedly) a $1m contest for TRX dapp developers. Being someone who has been highly active in all blockchain dapp scenes, I have been watching this unfold. I figured I'd post it here so you guys can help put the pieces together.

Basically, tons of supposed USDT prizes for people to win by developing on TRX. This is the main reason why some eth devs decided to port games to TRX  - Not because they are ""jumping ship"" like the shillers want you to believe (In fact many of them who I know personally still plan to continue developing on Eth). They just wanted a piece of the contest prizes and its pretty easy to put an eth dapp onto tron.

Anyways, yesterday was supposed to be when they decide winners. The results werent announced and people started to get anxious. Finally today they said that they emailed all the winners. Inside the email included the following:

>Due to the unexpectedly high volume of competitive projects, we have made some adjustments to the prize structure, one of them is to award over 100+ projects instead of 56 projects. More details to be announced soon. Please stay tuned:)

Apparently they decided to change the prize payouts, dropping the lowest prize to $1k instead of $5k. Many people were upset about this in the official tron dev discord feeling they had been mislead. Some even seem to think there is something deeper going on. For example, one Super Representative candidate posts:

>Nobody even knows that they'll pay out the full 1,000,000 I can guarantee they won't. They didn't pay out the full amount last competition They're not cutting prize amounts because so many people supposedly entered, they're cutting them because they won't pay the full amount. 100 winners is not better than 57 when the majority of those winners took 30 minutes to reskin an existing smart contract on the network You can make all the excuses you want, or try to see the good in it but you're only lying to yourself When we got $75k shaved off our prize, we weren't happy because 100 winners were better than 57. They didn't even pick winners for some of the prizes.

&#x200B;

There were some people who said they received the email and won $1k, but interestingly nobody was coming out in the public saying they won a large prize. After some sleuthing, we found this [instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsgCyyGAHv-/) of apparently some random person associated with ""STOken Studio"" who appears to have won the $200k prize. Dont bother trying to google it, nothing will come up. All we were able to find about this mysterious project was this [embarassingly empty github](https://github.com/chews/stoken) with only 3 commits \[edit: it has been deleted or made private 1 day after making this post\], and this  [https://stokenstudio.firebaseapp.com/](https://stokenstudio.firebaseapp.com/) . The [smart contract code](https://github.com/chews/stoken/blob/master/contractAgent/chalicelib/STOken.sol) is nonexistent and if the website is even doing anything, it appears to be on shasta testnet. Upon analysis, one of the SR candidates from the discord jokes that this ""dapp"" is just a microsoft word plugin.

Additionally in the FAQs on tron accel website it clearly says entrants must be on mainnet:

>Can I develop a DApp that does not use smart contracts, but does use TRX?  
>  
>Yes, you can. It is OK for you to not use TVM, but you have to be on the Mainnet.

Grand prize aside, some other funny stuff: One dev decided to clone ""Shrimp Farm"" from eth to tron just as an experiment. It surprisingly got a ton of volume despite being a simple ponzi game. This led to a huge amount of clones onto tron, including Tron Anthills, Crocs, and many others. Surprisingly, although Tron Shrimp clearly had the most volume, users, and txns, it did not win a prize. BUT ONE OF THE CLONES OF THIS CLONE DID! The Anthills developer ""diego"" posted to his community that he was one of the winners!

**To summarize, so far:**

* They changed the prizes *after* the contest ended
* They allowed clones to win but not the original clone onto TRX
* They allowed contestants to win who didnt meet the criteria (being on mainnet)
* They allowed projects that arent open source to win
* The Grand Winner is a mysterious project with barely any info available
* They havent posted a public list of the winners
* Some blatant ponzi games have won prizes

If you want to watch this all unfold live, you can find the Tron dev discord [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/a254am/in_1_months_time_the_tron_discord_channel_has/) and go to the #tronaccelerator channel. Tons of FUD currently, bring popcorn. It will be interesting to see if they ever post a public list of the winners or if they just delay it in hopes that people eventually stop talking about it

**Update**:One of the official Judges (Vincent, Dapp.review) has appeared in the discord. Some of his comments:

>I think they did a screening before sending to judges. I didn’t see all submitted dapps  
>  
>The list we got is less than 40 dapps, I think it’s for big prize📷  
>  
>No I don’t have the final results

Paradoxically, this was the email that some developers received from Tron Accelerator:

>Dear TRON Developers,  This email is to notify you that, up to this point, TRON Accelerator final prizes have been announced through emails already, we would like to thank you for your hard work and enthusiasm in developing your dApps for the past 5 weeks!  Due to the unexpectedly high volume of competitive projects, we have made some adjustments to the prize structure, one of them is to award over 100+ projects instead of 56 projects. More details to be announced soon. Please stay tuned:)  Thanks again,

Adding to the list:

* There was a ""screening"" before the dapps were being even given to the judges (by who? based on what?)
* One of the judges himself does not have the final results yet the email claims that all prizes were announced through emails",1012,2019-01-12 03:24:18,334

TRX,cryptocurrency,Why TRON (TRX) is booming right now.,"Disclaimer: I own a fair share of TRON. This post is aimed to educate and inform people about an upcoming good project. 

As you might have noticed TRON (TRX) is on the rise for quite some days now. Today it went from 0.015 to 0.037 at the max. It seems to have stabalised for now around 0.03.

What is TRON?

Quoted from The Sun:

What is TRON?

TRON aims to “heal the Internet” by constructing a worldwide free content entertainment system on the blockchain. The protocol allows users to freely publish, store and own data, enabling them to own the rights to their content and decide when, how, and at what cost to share it.

Sun wants to position TRON as a new kind of “distributed economy” in digital entertainment—including anything from streaming video to online gambling to social networks—where the users themselves own the economy. TRONIX is the cryptocurrency that runs on TRON. An important note here is that, in service of that distributed economy, TRON also supports other cryptocurrencies.

Why is TRON rising? 

Their CEO, Sun, graduated from an 

- They have flown under the radar for quite some time and are gaining traction now that more people notice the value and competent team of TRON.

- Upcoming partnerships. A recent rumour is that they are working behind the scenes with Alibaba.com. 

- Their team is amazing. Ex-staff with high position in Ripple, Paypal, Alibaba. 

- They are listed on a few exchanges but nothing of the likes of Bittrex, Bithumb, Bitfinex. They are in the talks with these exchanges as of now.

A recent tweet from Sun:

More exchanges to come, more partnership to come, the most important is more developers to come!

— Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) December 12, 2017

The only thing that might be seen as a bad thing for now:

- The circulating supply is actually quite high. A token burn at some point seems imminent. ",36,2017-12-16 19:58:26,35

TRX,cryptocurrency,I need help (TRX),"So, my dad is a huge fan of TRON.. he keeps bragging about it with stuff like « it will do x10 in a week » blah blah blah .. the problem is he only watches video talking good about tron because these youtubers are owning TRON, so they will obviously defend it, well that’s my point of view at least.
However, on my side, I kept hearing bad stuff about TRON, just looking on this sub when going through a TRON thread it’s mostly troll and jokes about how bad it is.. no one talk about the technology. I also heard from crypto twitter account I am following (I try to follow the most unbiased people, kinda hard) that TRON was raising a lot of red flags and that people should not be interested by this project.

What is your opinion about that ? What problems does TRON have ? What is the use of this coin ? Is it, like my dad say, « the best cryptocurrency » ? 

Thanks for your reply, if there are any.. I don’t know if this kind of post is allowed though.. we can discuss on Twitter if needed @Keodrop",0,2018-08-25 19:44:20,34

TRX,cryptocurrency,Discussion of the Day: Tron TRX,"-Today's Crypto of the Day is Tron TRX, and it's current price is $0.0126.


-Since 2/18/20, I have posted a crypto/asset of the day for discussion.  I typically begin by posting the current price, as well as the brief CoinMarketCap summary. If there is a video featuring it on Coin Bureau, I also post that. After a week or so, I usually post replies to some of the posts, and I also add an overall summary of my thoughts, if I plan to hold any, and is so how much. 

-I strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. There is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. You may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. I know I certainly did!
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=author%3Ajoenorwood77&restrict_sr=on

-My first month or so I featured projects listed on some of the main exchanges. Now I plan to focus on the top 100 on CoinMarketCap. After that I expect to broaden to the top 200, and then some random moonshots. I will eventually create a post looking for any projects I should feature before I eventually close this project.

-Just because I feature a project does not mean I like it. I feel discussion on bad projects are just as important as the good ones. It is useful to hear pros and cons about every project, even if you are simply playing devils advocate.

-I would say a perfect reply would include at least one pro and at least one con for the project. However, I still feel it is acceptable if you post only pros or cons. If your post does not have any substance to it, ""this coin is a scam"", ""avoid this shitcoin"", ""this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020"", then I will just assume you are posting for personal gain rather than helping the community.  If you simply downvote the post without any comments, the only thing you accomplish is having less people view the post. I do not care about Reddit Karma, but if a post drops to zero early on, it can be extremely difficult for people to even find these discussions (which I assume is your intention). 

-These posts are not meant to be financial advice, but instead to be an educational discussion. Everyone is responsible for doing their own research. For each project, I am interested in learning if you have any investment in it, and if so, about what percentage of your portfolio does it carry. Most importantly, what should we all know; good, bad, and indifferent, about this project? ",7,2020-04-06 00:03:16,22

However, after *ahem* the founder of Bitcoin SV was found taking legal action against those who claimed he is not Satoshi Nakamoto, binance reacted swiftly and appropriately by delisting Bitcoin SV.


Now probably the biggest reason why I'm not going to list the CEO of Tron's problems is because **there are way too many to list here.** In the past month he's done *a lot* to lose credibility, and if you want to know more just search for his name on the reddit search bar.

TRX,cryptocurrency,I need some perspective on Tron TRX,"In a rabid state of drug induced FOMO, I found myself in possession of many, many TRX near the bottom of yesterday's dump. Now in the light of day, I am questioning my decision. I read the white papers. I researched the team. I crawled through /r/Tronix (yeesh). Here are my impressions. I'd like the gentle, rational folk at /r/cryptocurrency to respond to my thinking and offer their own insights. Or just tell me why I made a stupid move. 

- So Tron is basically trying to be the Amazon/Alibaba of media. It'll include a single user gateway to video, gaming, gambling, and whatever else. They're going to lead with what looks like Tinder with Skype sex functionality and a creepy pay-the-hot-ones component, then add more stuff when the main-net drops in Q1. In 8-10 years, they're the metaplatform through which the world will access and consume its media. We know this will happen because:

- Justin Sun, who we believe in from the bottom of our hearts despite having only just heard of him, is the wunderkind most likely to enter the Chinese business pantheon of Jack Ma and his ilk. He's not a techie, but he has one killer payment app that has 10 million users. He knows how to use Twitter. He's connected in global tech. 
- Good devs seem to be hopping aboard after leaving giants like Alibaba. 
- Strong investors, partnerships that will be named at some future time. 
- The shitty dog game. 

To me, this all spells the promise of short term future hype. Whether this hype will be sustained 3 months from now is another story. But then again, I've only just started educating myself about Tron. Am I missing important elements? Why do you believe in Tron? Why do you think I should put my TRX back into ETH where it belongs?",12,2018-01-06 04:14:06,24

TRX,cryptocurrency,Sam Bankman-Fried might've just committed another crime (NO CLICKBAIT). Partnering with Tron (Justin Sun).,"So the man himself was speaking today. But didn't say how he f\*cked every users. And how he misused their funds, which was estimated roughly $9 billion US dollars.

Now, he might've just committed another crime by partnering with Tron (Justin Sun). Here is what he posted on his own Twitter.

so what does it all mean? It means if you would like to withdraw your assets out of FTX, you have a choice of swapping your whatever assets to TRX, BTT, JST, SUN, and HT token. They are owned by Justin Sun. Here is a funny part and I could say outright this is illegal. The man just try to reduce his liabilities by f\*\*king his users once more time.

This is the price of TRX on spot market on FTX.

Basically, if you have $1 million dollars worth of assets and you would like to withdraw via Huobi (owned by Justin Sun). You would have to buy TRX, then send it to Huobi, then sell it. At the end, you lost nearly 5 times, end up having only $200k.

Not only the users was already f\*\*\*ed. This clown decided to f\*\*\* them once more time. Either you got something (4-5 times less than what you own) or nothing. It is like take it or leave it.

This clown just want to reduce his debt and decided to sacrifice his customers.

Who benefits in the end?

1. Sam Bankman-Fried, because he reduces his liability.
2. Justin Sun. He sends his tokens to FTX and sells them who needs to get out from FTX.

Those people are the reasons for outsiders and governments around the world to attack cryptos in general.

Well, let them all die so we could move on.

I mean, what the hell law enforcement in the US is doing? Just allow it to happen?

Let me get it straight: I have no tokens locked up on FTX nor I own any tokens associated with him and Justin Sun. But seeing this kinda action harming the crypto industry and people makes me sick.

I don't know what to advise you guys who have tokens locked up there. Maybe seek advice from your lawyers.

Edit #1: He has a hole of $9 billion dollars, right (probably lost due to a psychopath in Alameda Research, who lost it all to yield farming and seeding new project). If all users and investors decide to get out of FTX via this kinda mechanism, basically he only owes those people $1.8 billion dollars. Because people decide to take 4-5 times loss.

I see they have strong commits on their github, they have a powerful social presence (which I think is important to prevent quick exits, it holds someone/people liable), and they seem to deliver on promises.

TRX,cryptocurrency,"6 months ago, a user vowed to do the exact opposite of this sub’s financial advice. He said he would post the result but hasn’t. I do an experiment and see how things would go. Results today: he is currently down 20%. Had he done as per this sub’s advice, he would have been up 25%.","6 months ago, I remember reading a post from an user who wrote:

“I'm going to conduct a test with $1000. I'm going to do the opposite of whatever the majority of /r/cryptocurrency is saying to do.

If they say not to invest in XRP, I'll invest in XRP. No way any of this is going into ALGO, VeChain, BTC, or ETH.

I'm operating on the premise that reddit will almost always get it wrong. This will either prove or disprove that premise. 

I will only be buying coins that are commonly shitted on in this subreddit. Will post results.”

I’m curious and try to do an experiment from his vow. 

In a comment on the same day, OP said he would buy $500 DOGE, $250 TRX and $250 XRP.

His DOGE-TRX-XRP portfolio:

|Coins|Start value|18/04/2021|05/11/2021|Today value|Gain or Loss %|
:--|--:|:--|:--|--:|--:|
|DOGE|$500.00|0.3205|0.2611|$407.33|-18.53%|
|TRX|$250.00|0.1429|0.1037|$181.42|-27.43%|
|XRP|$250.00|1.41|1.16|$205.67|-17.73%|
|Total|$1,000.00|||$794.43|-20.56%​|

This sub's most loved: BTC-ETH-VET-ALGO portfolio

|Coins|Start value|18/04/2021|05/11/2021|Today value|Gain or Loss %|
:--|--:|:--|:--|--:|--:|
|BTC|$250.00|56216.19|61080.29|$271.63|8.65%|
|ETH|$250.00|2237.14|4486.99|$501.42|100.57%|
|ALGO|$250.00|1.45|1.85|$318.97|27.59%|
|VET|$250.00|0.2546|0.1597|$156.81|-37.27%|
|Total|$1,000.00|||$1,248.83|24.88%​|

So on this part, if it happens exactly like this, he is wrong. 

Caveat: 

* Time can change anything, however. If Ripple does win the lawsuit, the picture would be different. However, as of today, ALGO, Bitcoin and Ethereum returns are better.

* A lot of luck would be needed when purchasing some meme coins that later shoot up to the moon.

TRX,cryptocurrency,Staking TRX now earning 13.5% (annual) makes ETH 2.0 irrelevant.,"Just my $.02 (or <1 TRX):

October 23, 2018. Why is that date important? It's the last day ETH had more transactions that TRX and it hasn't come close since [source](https://coinmetrics.io/charts/#assets=trx,eth_roll=7_left=TxCnt_zoom=1536890400000,1568426400000). 

If you're excited Ethereum 2.0 and staking, why? ETH has been on a ""low-boil"" for years, and has been playing catch-up to Tron since TRX split from ETH (Tron is a company after all, not a non-profit like Ethereum). ETH 2.0 doesn't even mention a privacy token, something TRON is planning for Q4 2020. 

I'm earning an annual rate of 13.5% staking TRX right now (14.45% APY if you stake your earnings daily). With Tronwallet, you can even swap your earned TRX for Bitcoin, in the app!

Tron's biggest weakness is Justin Sun and the stupid shit he says. He has definitely pissed me off a couple times and I sold in the past. But between the two, ETH and TRX. ETH foundation sits on their arse and George RR Martin's the shit outta promising features while Tron actually gets shit done. I was flipping TRX/BTC back and forth but I'm sticking with TRX through this next bull run. TRX/BTC pair is the lowest its been since 9/2019, now would be a great time to buy imo.

I know ETH2.0 can theoretically support 15k transactions per second, better than TRX now but other than that please tell me why ETH 2.0 is better.",0,2020-05-16 03:40:25,11

As Tron Foundation participates in this  investment as a  strategic partner, the two parties will work together to  develop the  First NFT marketplace in the TRON ecosystem and launch  auctions soon.

Earlier   this month, DeFine and Tron formed a strategic partnership. With the   integration of DeFine on the Tron network, users and creators across the   globe will be able to enjoy the platform without worrying about   transaction speed and fees. Meanwhile, DeFine will explore bringing its   unique NFT-based social profile system to the Tron ecosystem.

TRX,CryptoMarkets,Tron blockchain Analyser tool?,"
Hi guys,

Is there any tool / website out there where you can really analyse Tron addresses? 
I would like to make some analysis on certain Tron addresses and maybe also visualise them in regards of transfer volume / value but also show the transactions in and outbound. 

I can’t find anything on the net. 

And I’m not talking about Tronscan, this tool is a pain in the ass from my POV.",2,2020-12-21 09:03:25,2

TRX,CryptoMarkets,Experience of sending USDT via Tron (TRX) rather than Ethereum,"I first have to confess I am one of the biggest Tron haters and an avid Ethereum supporter. However, I was going to send $120 USDT via Ethereum and the cost was going to be $12. When I switched to TRON in an attempt to save money, the cost was $0 and it was faster. That is 10% in savings. I know TRON is a bull crap network that is centralized but user experience and savings are a big deal. 

The problem with Ethereum layer 2 is that they are not implemented at the wallet, exchange or dex levels (except loopring) and you still have to exit to Ethereum main chain and pay massive fees. If it takes over a year or longer for layer 2 on ETH to be implemented across wallets, Dexes and Exchanges; ETH's empire will have chunks bitten off by competitors.",1,2021-02-21 20:43:24,0

TRX,CryptoMarkets,The proposal of TRON and its TRX currency is very interesting,"TRON is a decentralized protocol based on blockchain that aims to develop a digital entertainment platform. The cryptocurrency system allows the user to generate and share content in a free, free and decentralized way. Actually, the official currency is TRONIX (TRX), the platform's payment method.

Why has this currency caught my attention? 

I am an online casino player and the TRX is perfectly adapted to these platforms, because of its different characteristics. When we talk about the digital entertainment sector we refer to online games, digital casinos (which has already been integrated into platforms such as Earnbet), online video games, online concerts....

The platform is based in Singapore and is regulated within the laws of the Asian country. The digital currency has a maximum of 100 billion TRX and currently has 66 billion in circulation (two thirds).

With all this, the TRX platform aims to challenge the world's leading content providers: Facebook, YouTube, Google Play Store, Apple App S",0,2020-09-24 01:29:38,1

TRX,CryptoMarkets,Market Behavior XRP and TRX,"Hello! I've recently noticed an interesting pattern in the market. Before the latest altcoin dump, XRP experienced a pump, and this isn’t the first time I’ve seen this. It seems like when XRP pumps, it pulls a lot from the market cap, which then leads to other altcoins dropping. I read somewhere that after an XRP pump, alts tend to dump, but after a TRX pump, alts actually pump too. Could this be due to their blockchain roles and ecosystems? For instance, XRP is increasingly used by banks and its huge supply, while TRX powers the TRC-20 network, where it’s widely used for transactions. Does anyone have insights into why XRP and TRX seem to impact the market so differently?",3,2024-11-14 18:24:15,2

TRX,CryptoMarkets,TRX is inching closer and closer to all time high and no one is talking about it,"I get it that this blockchain was created by Justin Sun and a lot of people find it very sketchy, but if you have ever interacted with protocols on the Tron blockchain you know that it is what ETH wanted to be. Fast and cheap transaction speeds as well as very scalable. Note: I was invested in tron back in 2020-2022, but no longer have any coins. However, it has remained on my crypto watchlist since then.  
Looking at the chart you can see that the price has been steadily increasing. The chart in my opinion is similar to XRP's, but has barely had any volatility. Currently up 130% since the beginning of 2023, TRX only needs another 30% to reach its all time high. We shall see how this plays out, but I hope everyone is seeing what I'm seeing.

I am happy to say I attended the largest block chain event in history (conference wise). There were over 4,000 people in attendance with tickets peaking at $2500 per ticket. I also did multiple interviews and am going to start writing for one, if not many of the major crypto currency news outlets. This was a very exciting week and I have so much to share with the Kingdom! I gained significant market insight from meeting with founders of the top coins. You can learn 100x more about an individual, a coin’s structure, future developments, and their roadmap over the course of drinks than at any conference. There was clearly opulence but the personalities were humble. I highly recommend any crypto investor/trader/gambler to highly consider attending one of the next large conferences.

I have selected multiple coins from the conference that will be winners in Q1 but before I announce those I am going to ensure I can take advantage of this market rebound. Hopefully you all were trading ARK, Augur, and DASH as I mentioned the conference provided them great exposure! Lots of people were asking about a Binance coin that would be close to a “moonshot.” What most people don’t realize is that you have to hold moonshots for 1 month plus generally. So instead I found my favorite “recovery coins” on Binance and Bittrex.

Binance’s Pick: Tron. TRX has been hit by FUD in recent weeks. We all see how the market responded shortly after FUD attacks. TRX generally trails the price of TNB very closely and currently is separated by its largest margin in over a month. I expect TRX to have a 25-50% recovery in the next week which makes this an easy play with a game on the horizon and a rebounding market. TRX for Binance!

Bittrex: RDD coin is a fantastic option with the overwhelming majority traded on Bittrex and one of the lowest price points of any coin many will flock to this little coin when their other coins have rebounded. Which they have! RDD has yet to rebound making it a prime opportunity to capture a rebound in coin A while also capturing it in RDD. I expect RDD to have a recovery that almost mimics the markets (although delayed 24-48hrs).

KuCoin: HOLD and accumulate! These little guys rebound the most when they “bounce” back. Have your buy and sell orders in place to capture dips and gains in the market!

My two favorite ICOs for January are closing (reaching hard caps very very soon!) If you are interested today would be the day to get involved. Fortunately, I will be listing new favorite ICOs and coins in the following week.

STRAT has a big announcement later this week and was trading above $20 last week during their 1st announcement. I expect STRAT to approach $30 following their announcement this week which is almost a 100% gain. ICX has both their mainnet launch and is hosting a conference in the tallest building in Seoul on the 25th of January. Koreans love trading and boy do they love their little coin ICX! Last but not least of the “safer plays” is NEO. If you hold it on Binance you will receive GAS at the end of the month (a nice dividend!), plus NEO is hosting DevCon this year which is also in under 2 weeks! I expect the same result as what happened with ARK, RSK and DASH in the last 48hrs to occur during these “sponsored” conferences by NEO and ICX. This should be a very strong week for the safe plays with lots of opportunity to catch the market rebound.

Tomorrow’s Crypto King Report will dwarf this one but I wanted to make sure I could supply a little bit of post conference wisdom on this lovely Saturday! If you have a topic you want explored or need a referral link for Binance or the ICOs let me know!

We received some lovely news out of India today (that is sarcasm in my voice). Well before I tell you about India let’s discuss the Miami conference which was truly bigger than expected with more than 4k participants and daily lectures by the founders of DASH, AUGUR, and ARK (along with many ICOs). AUGUR was the strongest of the 3 conference plays but all 3 would have yielded above market returns during the 2-4 day period of the conference that I acquired and held through. If you traded on the conference plays it was a good move! The Miami conference set the stage for 3+ months of conferences every single weekend with larger crowds week after week. DevCon is in less than 2 weeks but there are conferences from London to Manilla that shouldn’t be forgotten. With all this positive news, and energy gleaming from the crypto sector why the dip today? Didn’t we just have a huge correction?

The answer is yes we did just have a huge correction (approximately 50% of the total crypto market cap). However, it is very important to note the importance of sentiment in these markets. India today stated (allegedly) that the banks would no longer allow the transfer of funds from bank accounts to crypto related sites/exchanges. This obviously sent tremors through the crypto community. Personally I think the dip today was exaggerated which means it’s the perfect time to shop for cheap alts that you believe in! Remember sell when sentiment is highest and buy when sentiment is lowest (buy on dips sell on peaks). The price of BTC when comparing the USD and the Rupee showed an arbitrage opportunity. This meant it has been more difficult to purchase BTC using the Rupee for an extended period of time. Coinbase and other similar exchanges meant for simplifying purchasing crypto using FIAT have not participated in the Indian market for some time. Banks in India have never made the purchasing of crypto easy and today’s news created an over exaggerated dip in a market that by a population that wasn’t participating in crypto trading very significantly anyways.


This has been an exceptionally long weekend but I wanted to make sure to break down my opinion on the India FUD news and upcoming conferences before the weekend was over. STRAT and ICX have major implementations and news this week. NEO is paying GAS at the end of January, hosting many new ICOs, and sponsoring DevCon in 2 weeks. This means they should be in every portfolio awaiting news and twitter announcements. If you like to day trade and are seeking rebound coins RDD and TRX are my favorite plays on Binance and Bittrex. Make sure to follow for daily reports! If you want to know which ICOs I currently like or join the Kingdom’s Discord shoot me a message!  I wish all a very positive week. The crypto markets should do what they do best following an FUD attack. Rally FUDing hard!

TRX,CryptoMarkets,"The Crypto King Report Jan 23rd: An ICO Special, Market Updates, Moonshots and Coin Selections (STRAT, ICX, NEO, TRX, BRD, MTL, NEO, SC, RDD)","I am currently invested in 4 ICOs that have yet to release their tokens. ICOs are unique in the sense that they provide a way to “lock up” funds for a period of time (usually 2 months). When the token hits the exchange you usually (if the ICO is successful) have a nice pump, and within 4 months it is trading between 500%-1000% above your ICO price. Normally once it hits the first exchange it is already trading 200% above the ICO price. The harder aspect is trying to predict successful ICOs. However, with a ROI at 500%-1000% you only have to be correct about 1/5 to be successful. Our goal is not to be 1/5 but to be 5/5. Analyzing the whitepaper, the team, the roadmap, where they are in development, partnerships, and existing products are all invaluable aspects to an ICO. Through significant analysis I’ve found my January plays which are listed below:

For a referral link for any of these ICOs please PM me! Regardless if you use the referral these I highly recommend!


HireMatch –  Monster meets the blockchain! They were at the Miami BTC conference and this is truly a fantastic concept. Hiring agencies have taken the internet by storm and assuming blockchain breaks into all sectors of business, the hiring sector is next! This is also a great ICO for U.S. based investors. They are located in Sunnyvale, CA. While the founders have significant experience in the hiring realm being the creators of Recruiter.com and other major recruitment agencies. Their coin symbol is HIRE and their ICO sale is ending fairly soon! With a very well connected team, already formed partnerships, and the ability for U.S. based investors to take place this is has potential to be a great coin! Referral link removed, contact for it please :).


Iungo- “AIRBNB for internet access.” It lets an individual or business owner rent out the access of their internet. This ICO reached its soft cap VERY quickly and is within $5 million of its hard cap. This will only be recommended for the 2 or 3 days prior to reaching the hard cap. With the soft cap achieved already, the ability to rent out your internet being fairly revolutionary, and less than 1 week left in the ICO sale, this is a very intriguing play. Imagine being able to regularly rent out the use of your router when you weren’t home, or when your business was closed but the router was still on. This is a very cool use of the blockchain and provides many with a new side income! Referral link removed, contact for it please :).


STORIQA: “The Amazon Cryptocurrency Marketplace”. Great team, great platform, easy to sign up for ICO (even for U.S. investors). Well past their soft cap and approaching their hard cap! Discount for bonus coins still available in the short term! This has been on and off of my rec list but because they are approaching their hard cap I figured I’d give everyone one last opportunity to sign up! Referral link removed, contact for it please :).

KYC Legal: Know Your Customer (the dreaded KYC form). If you’ve completed an ICO recently you know the form I’m talking about. The form they give you at the end, after you’ve sent your .5eth but before they will release their tokens. Basically stating you understand this market is unregulated, etc. Well a blockchain token has in essence solved this problem. I HATE KYC forms and if the KYC system was set up in a way in which you wouldn’t have to fill out that form repeatedly for every ICO it would be more convenient for all investors and ICO companies. KYC Legal intends to do just that. According to the founder DR, “This is a simple and quick way to complete client identification procedures, which can then be used to verify the client’s identity during various financial operations (so-called KYC (“know your customer”) requirements that financial institutions and companies working with the money of private individuals use to identify and verify counterparties before starting a financial transaction). This niche is completely untapped and I HATE KYC forms enough to think this is a brilliant idea. They are calling it a “Universal alternative to Personal IDs,” on the block chain. Brilliant concept and there are 2 days left to receive the 38% discount from the final price. A 38% gain prior to token sale completion is significant, imagine what will happen when the hard cap is reached and it hits the first exchange. Referral link removed, contact for it please :).

This sums up my favorite 4 ICOs that are completing in the next few days. I would highly recommend (as I have) to get involved in them to keep your ETH safe during these fluctuations and almost have a guaranteed % increase 2 months from now. Always stay diversified, do not be in all alts, ICOs, or the CB options. Always have a rotating diversified portfolio!

It looks like the market has finally taken a positive turn! I was expecting this following the 3 rounds of FUD attacks (South Korea, China, and India). Unfortunately, it took a few days longer than expected. The one outlier date that exists this week is the second round of options expiring. The options traders (institutional money) crashed the market intentionally last week and this may repeat itself this week. If they do crash it again I would recommend scooping up the cheapest alts you believe in as they will rebound with much more ferocity than BTC. They are using their institutional money to play GOD and manipulate but you can easily counter this by grabbing cheap alts and enjoying the significant rebound that occurs following these market crashes and FUD attacks. There are more conferences beginning in 3 days (London) followed by San Francisco, Manilla, Singapore, Dallas, etc. The market may have corrected in January, especially with 3 rounds of FUD and option traders crashing it. However, this correction was healthy for a market cap that increased 40% in under 2 months. Following a correction, it takes the crypto market 5-60 days to reach new all-time highs (based on past events). With the conferences I think we will do it more quickly than 60 days. Only time will tell but we are in the rebound and this should be a great 2 months, even with the occasional FUD.


(STRAT, ICX, NEO, TRX, BRD, MTL, NEO, SC, RDD)

STRAT: We should receive our positive news in the next 72hrs! A new flagship ICO and being able to examine their ICO platform! STRAT is very inactive on twitter but their founder last week insinuated this week will be HUGE. The market recovery today and tomorrow should place STRAT in a perfect place to release positive news this week. I expect STRAT to break $20, possibly $25 following their news this week! ETH was $1 at presale a year ago, STRAT will be a worthy competitor for ETH within 3 months. 

ICX: I’ve been on this Korean sensation for almost 3 weeks now! This is the week! Mainnet release is on the 25th at the largest building (skyscraper) in Seoul for a conference that ICX is hosting. The South Korean govt. just went from FUD attacks to almost full support. Their timing couldn’t be better for our little ICX! GO ICX GO! This is your week!

NEO: China’s ETH, it is unfortunate China has taken such a negative stance on cryptos (publicly). The rumors swirling is that they are about to flip flop on their stance. All those huge mining pools in China that were allegedly “shut down” it turns out (rumors) that they were taken over by the state. It seems China is about to be one of the largest miners of crypto in the world (the actual govt.). I doubt they will continue to combat crypto but instead will begin to embrace it as it makes the government very wealthy. NEO is hosting DevCon in 2 weeks and is paying GAS on Binance on the 1st. NEO is a must own leading into DevCon and GAS! I expect the Chinese to relax their restrictions as the rumors swirling are the opposite of what our lovely news agencies are cramming down our throats (FUD). With relaxed restrictions, DevCon, and GAS, NEO wins.

TRX: They announced today their BETA would be out March 29th. For a coin that so many people love to hate, I’m beginning to love to love them. They are a great coin for day trading with huge fluctuations, and they seem to be continuing their development even with all the public pressure and FUD. With a game coming out on the horizon and their BETA launch, I’m very excited to own, and day trade TRX. (Binance)

BRD: New wallet features being unlocked this month using the BRD token, breadcrumbs being sprinkled around events ($50-$1000 in BTC on each one!), and sponsoring 2 of the next 5 events make this an easy winner for February. The publicity between new wallet features, adding purpose to the BRD token, and huge sponsorships should give this coin the launch pad to end in every portfolio (and on the moon!). I can see BRD being a $5 token by the end of February.

MTL: They were delisted from Bittrex basically for being lazy. The Dev team is still hard at work on their platform even though Bittrex gave them until January 1st. They missed their deadline and were delisted. Their delisting and the market correction place this coin in a perfect place for a rebound. Their Dev team has promised to release their platform in Q1, at that point a coin most had lost hope in will explode onto the scene. Bittrex even stated they would relist them if they complete their platform, etc. MTL should have one of the best Q1s out of any coin that isn’t listed to CB.

SC: Siacoin is on Bittrex and going through a hard fork. With Bittrex also opening up to new registrants, SC is in a perfect spot to have a flood of money into it. Many big traders are hypothesizing the coins specifically on Bittrex will pop when they open their gates back up to the masses. This speaks very well for low priced options with great tech, and going through hard forks to improve (SC). This also speaks volumes to coins like RDD which are some of the cheapest on Bittrex and are great for day trading!

Moonshots!!!! I haven’t listed a Moonshot in a while because the market has been in the toilet for 3 weeks “correcting” and dealing with FUD. I have a few moonshots I am analyzing and hope to have one ready for release by the end of the week! For now, the play is to accumulate low priced alts on KuCoin/Binance/Bittrex (KuCoin is the best for moons!) as most have fallen 50-75% from 2 weeks prior. Please PM if you’d like to know about specific KuCoin coins, have suggestions for educational aspects incorporated into daily reports or for specific referral links!

TRX,CryptoMarkets,"Without that, could crypto really move forward?","Honestly, I think we’re finally getting closer to mass adoption of crypto as a payment method. The main barrier, for the longest time, has been the lack of practical ways to spend directly in crypto. Personally, since 2021, I’ve barely used a bank account or card for online payments because the fees are just... insane! But recently, for some subscriptions, I had to try out Redotepay. It’s okay, but when I go through Google Pay, it costs me $12 in the mobil App instead of $8 directly on  site web for my X premium. Why the price difference? Who knows.

As for Bitget Pay, it could actually be a solid alternative. No transaction fees, fast, convenient... sounds better than Google Pay or Apple Pay for regular payments, especially without extra fees. But for now, it’s limited to BTC, ETH, and USDT. It’d be even better if they added TON and TRX.

Anyway, if you guys know of other ways to pay with crypto without having to throw away money on fees, let me know in the comments! Because paying $12 instead of $8 each month... that stings.",11,2024-11-04 09:54:05,73

TRX,CryptoMarkets,The proposal of TRON and its TRX currency is very interesting,"TRON is a decentralized protocol based on blockchain that aims to develop a digital entertainment platform. The cryptocurrency system allows the user to generate and share content in a free, free and decentralized way. Actually, the official currency is TRONIX (TRX), the platform's payment method.

Why has this currency caught my attention? 

I am an online casino player and the TRX is perfectly adapted to these platforms, because of its different characteristics. When we talk about the digital entertainment sector we refer to online games, digital casinos (which has already been integrated into platforms such as Earnbet), online video games, online concerts....

The platform is based in Singapore and is regulated within the laws of the Asian country. The digital currency has a maximum of 100 billion TRX and currently has 66 billion in circulation (two thirds).

With all this, the TRX platform aims to challenge the world's leading content providers: Facebook, YouTube, Google Play Store, Apple App S",0,2020-09-24 01:29:38,1

Make sure to follow on Reddit for Daily Crypto King Reports!

This week I am excited to announce we have another round of options expiring (sarcasm)! Last week we were able to see what institutional money was able to do in the crypto sphere. They decided to crash BTC 20% in one day to cash in on their short positions while rotating their profits into BTC holdings and enjoying another 20% climb. This would net a trade in excess of 50% in under 1 month, a move that would make any institutional trader foam at the mouth. That leads us to where we are today. I expected them to crash the options market last week and wrote about it. However, this week if they do it again they will have set a precedent for what we should expect monthly. Personally I think they are too smart for that, or think the population is too dumb to notice. If they are too smart to intentionally crash the market 2x in 10 days with the entire world now watching the move would be to do the opposite. I know it seems farfetched but if they crashed it last week, everyone is expecting them to crash it this week. However, what if instead of shorting it for the second round of options they went long? Pumping the price of BTC and alts the day of option expiration instead of crashing it. This will bring all those weak hands flooding back into the crypto sphere that left last week and allow them to capitalize on the opposite of what the populous was expecting. Regardless of what they do this will be an important trend to monitor in the coming months. They will either crash BTC to profit (as most assume they will) or pump it to do the opposite of what the public was expecting. Institutional money is leaps and bounds more intelligent than us Plankton, make sure to not get swallowed by a whale. HOLD strong! Cojones, big ones, are required in this game we call crypto!

ICX has their mainnet release today/tomorrow and according to their news release, “On January 31, 2018, ICON team will host our 1st ICON Annual Summit titled “The Genesis”, appropriately at one of the most iconic, tallest skyscrapers in the world — Lotte World Tower. Also appropriately, this event is timed just before the Lunar New Year.

We have invited blockchain experts, entrepreneurs, influencers, and other key decision-makers from around the globe to showcase our latest technical development including Mainnet, 2018 roadmap, and introduce a number of DApps that will run on top of the ICON network. ICON team has strived to “Hyperconnect the World”, and this day will mark the beginning of a new era, the birth of the ICON Network ecosystem.” The mainnet is on the cusp of being here, we are 1 week away from a major conference hosted by ICX in the capitol of South Korea. ICX will be a major play this week.

STRAT has yet to release their exciting news and I as many others are eagerly standing by. We expect it to be another Flagship ICO while also allowing the viewing of their ICO platform in full swing. The publicity STRAT will provide this week continuing through the month is exponential compared to other coins.

ICOs: So the PlusCoin ICO was underwhelming to say the least but with any risky investment you cannot win them all (I do talk about ICOs and coins I lose on!). Crypterium was my all-time favorite for December and recommended them daily until their hard cap was hit. This coin was a home run even during a bloodbath in the market. When the current price on IDEX is compared to the ICO price, CRPT has appreciated over 250%. That is in 1 month, imagine the price in 4-6 months? The entire market pulled back 50% yet CRPT went up 250%. It seems like the Kingdom may have just found a new favorite 1-2month investment strategy! The hardest choice will be when to sell. Does 250% satisfy you? What about 1000%? Pigs get fat. Hogs get slaughtered. Never forget this motto. 250% should satisfy all of you to a degree. Source: https://coincodex.com/crypto/crypterium/

I am currently invested in 4 ICOs that have yet to release their tokens. ICOs are unique in the sense that they provide a way to “lock up” funds for a period of time (usually 2 months). When the token hits the exchange you usually (if the ICO is successful) have a nice pump, and within 4 months it is trading between 500%-1000% above your ICO price. Normally once it hits the first exchange it is already trading 200% above the ICO price(CRPT). The harder aspect is trying to predict successful ICOs. However, with a ROI at 500%-1000% you only have to be correct about 1/5 to be successful. Our goal is not to be 1/5 but to be 5/5. Analyzing the whitepaper, the team, the roadmap, where they are in development, partnerships, and existing products are all invaluable aspects to an ICO. Through significant analysis I’ve found my January plays which PM me to receive :). There are 4 all completing very soon!

It looks like the market has finally taken a positive turn! I was expecting this following the 3 rounds of FUD attacks (South Korea, China, and India). Unfortunately, it took a few days longer than expected. The one outlier date that exists this week is the second round of options expiring. The options traders (institutional money) crashed the market intentionally last week and this may repeat itself this week. If they do crash it again I would recommend scooping up the cheapest alts you believe in as they will rebound with much more ferocity than BTC. They are using their institutional money to play GOD and manipulate but you can easily counter this by grabbing cheap alts and enjoying the significant rebound that occurs following these market crashes and FUD attacks. There are more conferences beginning in 3 days (London) followed by San Francisco, Manilla, Singapore, Dallas, etc. The market may have corrected in January, especially with 3 rounds of FUD and option traders crashing it. However, this correction was healthy for a market cap that increased 40% in under 2 months. Following a correction, it takes the crypto market 5-60 days to reach new all-time highs (based on past events). With the conferences I think we will do it more quickly than 60 days. Only time will tell but we are in the rebound and this should be a great 2 months, even with the occasional FUD.

No Updates From Yesterday On:(STRAT, ICX, NEO, TRX, BRD, MTL, NEO, SC, RDD)

STRAT: We should receive our positive news in the next 72hrs! A new flagship ICO and being able to examine their ICO platform! STRAT is very inactive on twitter but their founder last week insinuated this week will be HUGE. The market recovery today and tomorrow should place STRAT in a perfect place to release positive news this week. I expect STRAT to break $20, possibly $25 following their news this week! ETH was $1 at presale a year ago, STRAT will be a worthy competitor for ETH within 3 months.

NEO: China’s ETH, it is unfortunate China has taken such a negative stance on cryptos (publicly). The rumors swirling is that they are about to flip flop on their stance. All those huge mining pools in China that were allegedly “shut down” it turns out (rumors) that they were taken over by the state. It seems China is about to be one of the largest miners of crypto in the world (the actual govt.). I doubt they will continue to combat crypto but instead will begin to embrace it as it makes the government very wealthy. NEO is hosting DevCon in 2 weeks and is paying GAS on Binance on the 1st. NEO is a must own leading into DevCon and GAS! I expect the Chinese to relax their restrictions as the rumors swirling are the opposite of what our lovely news agencies are cramming down our throats (FUD). With relaxed restrictions, DevCon, and GAS, NEO wins.

TRX: They announced today their BETA would be out March 29th. For a coin that so many people love to hate, I’m beginning to love to love them. They are a great coin for day trading with huge fluctuations, and they seem to be continuing their development even with all the public pressure and FUD. With a game coming out on the horizon and their BETA launch, I’m very excited to own, and day trade TRX. (Binance)

BRD: New wallet features being unlocked this month using the BRD token, breadcrumbs being sprinkled around events ($50-$1000 in BTC on each one!), and sponsoring 2 of the next 5 events make this an easy winner for February. The publicity between new wallet features, adding purpose to the BRD token, and huge sponsorships should give this coin the launch pad to end in every portfolio (and on the moon!). I can see BRD being a $5 token by the end of February.

MTL: They were delisted from Bittrex basically for being lazy. The Dev team is still hard at work on their platform even though Bittrex gave them until January 1st. They missed their deadline and were delisted. Their delisting and the market correction place this coin in a perfect place for a rebound. Their Dev team has promised to release their platform in Q1, at that point a coin most had lost hope in will explode onto the scene. Bittrex even stated they would relist them if they complete their platform, etc. MTL should have one of the best Q1s out of any coin that isn’t listed to CB.

SC: Siacoin is on Bittrex and going through a hard fork. With Bittrex also opening up to new registrants, SC is in a perfect spot to have a flood of money into it. Many big traders are hypothesizing the coins specifically on Bittrex will pop when they open their gates back up to the masses. This speaks very well for low priced options with great tech, and going through hard forks to improve (SC). This also speaks volumes to coins like RDD which are some of the cheapest on Bittrex and are great for day trading!

Moonshots!!!! I haven’t listed a Moonshot in a while because the market has been in the toilet for 3 weeks “correcting” and dealing with FUD. I have a few moonshots I am analyzing and hope to have one ready for release by the end of the week! For now, the play is to accumulate low priced alts on KuCoin/Binance/Bittrex (KuCoin is the best for moons!) as most have fallen 50-75% from 2 weeks prior. Please PM if you’d like to know about specific KuCoin coins, have suggestions for educational aspects incorporated into daily reports or for specific referral links!",7,2018-01-24 18:27:48,0

TRX,CryptoMarkets,Cleaning up my coins before halving.,"So the halving of BTC is coming and I have been collecting some random and other coins for over a year now. I would like to clean it up a bit and put it all in some more “worth it” coins.  I just have not much of a clue in what coins I would swap it. 

So what I wanted to keep BTC, DOGE and maybe SHIB.  Also I do have some NEAR, ROSE, DGB, WAXL, ETH, SUI and TRX. 

What should I get rid of or keep or an extra coin I should add before the halving. 

It is a bit overwhelming to keep up with searching out what coin stands for what and the reason why I want to invest into the project.  So I would appreciate some advice and help to complete my “perfect pre halving” wallet. ",3,2024-04-07 22:22:41,43

TRX,CryptoMarkets,What are your top 10 coins to hold and why?,"**Here are my top 10 in order of personal holdings and briefly why I like them:**

1. XRB - decentralized, simple transactions that are free, quick and scalable, excellent P2P applications, expert and focused team, eco friendly, impending binance listing, impending fix of node/withdraw issue, price bump from future rebranding to NANO, far from too late to buy in (I bought very early and plan to hold)

2. BTC - mass name recognition, store of value, robust security, OG crypto, lots of support of devs, hard forks, lightning network, Segwit wallets (Needs to deal with scaling issues)

3. SUB - getting around censorship/firewalls, lower market cap, privacy, great team, lots of room for growth in market cap, efficient coin transactionally (I bought in early and has been a strong performer for me)

4. XRP - centralized (personally not a huge fan of centralized coins), major corporate backing, quick, cheap, and scalable transactions (I bought XRP to hedge against the risk that the corporations win out in crypto... I hope they don't honestly, but they are tricky and fickle institutions)

5. ICX - complex transactions, atomic swaps, low fees, quick and scalable transactions, lots of room for growth in market cap 

6. KCS - passive income through daily dividends (need to have a large amount for this to be worth it), growing exchange successfully adding new coins daily, tons of room for growth in both dividends and market cap increases, on big discount right now  

7. DRGN - family privacy, Disney backing with direct use cases for current/future Disney operations, low market cap, currently found on Kucoin

8. REQ - making crypto accessible to the masses by making a PayPal style button for crypto, aggressive Q1 objectives, low market cap, quality team, quick low cost transfers

9. BNB - a solid exchange bound to grow, 50% off fees when using BNB on Binance, grants Binance voting rights, strong community

10. NEO - quick, cheap transactions, dividends paid as GAS, complex transactions, regulation conscience, Dapps (Full disclosure recently sold my holding of NEO still like it though might even buy back)



**Let me know what you think of my list and share your own or however many you hold :)**


**EDIT 1:** Here are a few coins which are far risker and lower market cap. I have put some money into them as a gamble (I understand these could be a scam/flop and so should you! Im currently up quite a bit on ECA and PHO but I got in much earlier)

PHO: Merge mining, currently trading on c-patex (kinda sketch new exchange), paused on Cryptopia (where I got my PHO; Cryptopia seems to be working on getting PHO back operational), very low market cap, extreme risk/reward

ECA: Mobile phone mining, eco friendly, found on a bunch of sketchy exchanges including currently down coinsmarkets (where I got my ECA), very low market cap, extreme risk/reward 

XAS: LISK of China, currently on Kucoin (pretty solid exchange imo for low market cap coins), higher market cap then PHO and ECA but still low, decentralized, just bought a small amount in response to this post

**EDIT 2:** This post caused me to buy a small amount of XLM (less risky), VEN (risky), APPC (risky) and XAS (risky) thanks for the advice all!

XLM: Efficient currency, IBM partnership, some room for growth, FairX, just reinvested in this coin after selling in the past and bought small amount due to this post 

APPC: Dedicated team, Crypto apps, low market cap, undervalued, on binance, just bought small amount due to this post (Need to do more research on this before recommending)

VEN: Quality team, deep corporate ties/partnerships, hardware patents, currently on Binance, Chinese connections, Dapps, just bought a small amount in response to this post

**EDIT 3:** For fun here are some of the most talked about coins in the discussion over the past 21 hours that are not mentioned above just going to list names in no particular order thanks for contributing your time:

TRX,CryptoMarkets,"Crypto Investing Guide: Useful resources and tools, and how to create an investment strategy","Lots of people have PM'd me asking me the same questions on where to find information and how to put together their portfolio so I decided to put a guide for crypto investors, especially those who have only been in a few months and are still confused.

Many people entered recently at a time when the market was rewarding the very worst type of investment behavior. Unfortunately there aren't many guides and a lot of people end up looking at things like Twitter or the trending Youtube crypto videos, which is dominated by ""How to make $1,00,000 by daytrading crypto"" and influencers like CryptoNick.

So I'll try to put together a guide from what I've learned and some tips, on how to invest in this asset class. This is going to be Part 1, in another post later I'll post a systematic approach to valuation and picking individual assets.

#Getting started: Tools and resources
---------------------------

You don't have to be a programmer or techie to invest in crypto, but you should first learn the basics of how it functions. I find that [this video by 3Blue1Brown is the best introduction to what a blockchain actually is and how it functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4), because it explains it clearly and simply with visuals while not dumbing it down too much.  If you want a more ELI5 version with cute cartoons, then [Upfolio](http://www.upfolio.com) has a nice beginner's intro to the blockchain concept and [quick descriptions of top 100 cryptocurrencies](https://www.upfolio.com/100-coins-explained). I also recommend simply going to Wikipedia and reading the blockchain and cryptocurrency page and clicking onto a few links in, read about POS vs POW...etc. Later on you'll need this information to understand why a specific use case may or may not benefit from a blockchain structure. Here is a [quick summary of the common terms](http://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/a-quick-guide-to-cryptocurrency-terms) you should know.

Next you should arm yourself with some informational resources. I compiled a convenient list of useful tools and sites that I've used and find to be worthy of bookmarking:

**Market information**

* http://coinmarketcal.com - Keeping tabs of everything going on in crypto is tough, wouldn't it be great if there was some sort of calendar? Well this is a calendar of upcoming crypto events, whether its conferences, product releases, burns, exchange listings...etc. You can also filter by types of events, coins and month. 

* http://coin.fyi - Great for following the news related to a specific cryptocurrencies

* http://cryptopanic.com - An aggregator of various crypto sites and news, filterable. 

* http://coinspectator.com - Another aggregator from over a 100 different sources of crypto news.

* https://www.ccowl.com/news - News from major sites (CoinDesk, Cointelegram, Bloomberg...etc) on one page 

* http://cci30.com - Kind of like the S&P500 for crypto, its an index of the 30 biggest cryptocurrencies

* http://eveningstar.io - this is basicall trying to be the Morning Star for cryptos

* http://icotracker.net - I like this site for looking at what ICO are coming up

* http://www.icoalert.com - Another good site for upcoming ICO tracking

* http://icodrops.com - More ICO listings and they have a ""hype"" rating 

* http://bitcointalk.org - Probably the biggest crypto community, lots of Bitcoin old timers who have seen it all

* Both [Medium](http://medium.com/topic/cryptocurrency) and [Steemit](http://steemit.com/trending/cryptocurrency) have plenty of blogs to follow depending on what interests you within crypto

* Telegram is the preferred chat platform, just stay away from PnD groups (same for Discord PnD groups)



**Analysis tools**


* http://cryptowat.ch - Great charting tool owned by Kraken that gives you a pretty wide look at various cryptos across most major exchanges.

* http://coinmonsta.io/metrics - Want to see what the most shilled coins are on Twitter? This ranking multiplies the number of tweets vs. sentiment estimate to arrive at a score.

* http://onchainfx.com - A better version of coin market cap, has all sort of columns and you can add flags. Also I like their market segmentation filters. 

* http://www.sifrdata.com/ - Great visualizations of various metrics. I find their correlations to be very useful.

* http://www.coingecko.com - includes useful information about crypto like the breakdown volume by fiat currency, social media stats, code repository stats..etc

* http://www.tradingview.com/chart/ - the best charting site that I use for stocks, however it has plenty of major cryptos

* http://www.iconomi.net/dashboard - basically forms different ETFs out of cryptos. Not a bad place to get ideas for your portfolio.

* http://cointrading.ninja/correlation - See a matrix of price movement correlatiosn between various cryptocurrencies over various periods.

* http://coinmarketcap.com - Useful for scanning the market, and finding the blockchain explorer and official website for each individual crypto. Their API is also quite useful for Excel based analysis.

* http://icobench.com - Another ICO tracker which does nice summaries, shows teams, milestones, financials and gives a rating for each IC

* http://cryptomaps.org - Visualization of price across different segments, primarily hashing functions and ICO release dates

* http://solume.io - compares the number of Twitter mention increase decrease to price

* http://www.badbitcoin.org - a list of all the known scam sites. Check this list before joining something.


**Portfolio Tracking**

* Delta and Blockfolio are the major mobile apps, I personally recommend Delta. 

* For desktop [I prefer to use a CoinMarketCap API Excel tracker](http://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7m3nvy/ive_created_an_excel_crypto_portfolio_tracker/) that automatically draws live data from CoinMarketCap. Customize it to your own liking. There are also plenty of online tracking sites like AltPocket but I've never used them so can't recommend one.

**Youtube**


I generally don't follow much on Youtube because it's dominated by idiocy like Trevon James and CryptoNick, but there are some that I think are worthy of following:

* Crypto Investor - A background in finance gives Crypto Investor a much more nuanced approach, and he is very insightful in terms of investor behavioral psychology. Listening to his negativity and criticism of parabolic price action in a sea of lambo chasing is refreshing.

* CoinMastery - Carter Thomas takes on a rational mid-term to long term approach to investing in crypto, and has been a voice of reason many times.

* DataDash - He's more focused on trading, but I still like him for his news summaries and overall decent content.

* IvanOnTech - Brings a programmers perspective, goes through the Github and explains many programming issues with blockchains.



#Constructing a Investment Strategy
---------------------------

I can't stress enough how important it is to construct an actual investment strategy. Organize what your goals are, what your risk tolerance is and how you plan to construct a portfolio to achieve those goals rather than just chasing the flavor of the week.

Why? Because it will force you to slow down and make decisions based on rational thinking rather than emotion, and will also inevitably lead you to think long term.

#Setting ROI targets
---------------------------

Bluntly put, a lot of young investors who are in crypto have really unrealistic expectations about returns and risk.

A lot of them have never invested in any other type of financial asset, and hence many seem to consider a 10% ROI in a month to be unexciting, even though that is roughly what they should be aiming for.

I see a ton of people now on this sub and on other sites making their decisions with the expectation to double their money every month. This has lead a worrying amount of newbies putting in way too much money way too quickly into anything on the front page of CoinMarketCap with a low dollar value per coin hoping that crypto get them out of their debt or a life of drudgery in a cubicle. And all in the next year or two!  

But its important to temper your hype about returns and realize why we had this exponential growth in the last year. The only reason we saw so much upward price action is because of fiat monetary base expansion from people FOMO-ing in due to media coverage. People are hoping to ride the bubble and sell to a greater fool in a few months, it is classic Greater Fool Theory. That's it. Its not because we are seeing any mass increase in adoption or actual widespread utility with cryptocurrency. We passed the $1,000 psychological marker again for Bitcoin which we hadn't seen since right before the Mt.Gox disaster, and it just snowballed the positivity as headline after headline came out about the price growth. However those unexciting returns of 10% a month are not only the norm, but much more healthy for an alternative investment class. Here are the annual returns for Bitcoin for the last few years:

Year | BTC Return
------|-------
2017 | 1,300%
2016 | 120%
2015 | 35%
2014 | -60%
2013 | 5300%
2012 | 150 % 

Keep in mind that a 10% monthly increase when compounded equals a 313% annual return, or over 3x your money. That may not sound exciting to those who entered recently and saw their money go 20x in a month on something like Tron before it crashed back down, but that 3X annual return is better than Bitcoin's return every year except the year right before the last market meltdown and 2017. I have been saying for a while now that we are due for a major correction and every investor now should be planning for that possibility through proper allocation and setting return expectations that are reasonable.

**How to set a realistic ROI target**

How do I set my own personal return target? 

Basically I aim to achieve a portfolio return of roughly 385% annually (3.85X increase per year) or about 11.89% monthly return when compounded. How did I come up with that target? I base it on the average compounded annual growth return (CAGR) over the last 3 years on the entire market:

Year  | Total Crypto Market Cap 
-------|------
Jan 1, 2014:|  $10.73 billion 
Jan 1, 2017:  | $615 billion

>Compounded annual growth return (CAGR):  (615/10.73)^(1/3) = 385%

My personal strategy is to sell my portfolio every December then buy back into the market at around the beginning of February and I intend to hold on average for 3 years, so this works for me but you may choose to do it a different way for your own reasons. I think this is a good average to aim for as a general guideline because it includes both the good years (2017) and the bad (2014). Once you have a target you can construct your risk profile (low risk vs. high risk category coins) in your portfolio. If you want to try for a higher CAGR than about 385% then you will likely need to go into more highly speculative picks. I can't tell you what return target you should set for yourself, but just make sure its not depended on you needing to achieve continual near vertical parabolic price action in small cap shillcoins because that isn't sustainable. 

As the recent January dip showed while the core cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum would dip an X percentage, the altcoins would often drop double or triple that amount. Its a very fragile market, and the type of dumb behavior that people were engaging in that was profitable in a bull market (chasing pumps, going all in on a microcap shillcoin, having an attention span of a squirrel...etc) will lead to consequences. Just like they jumped on the crypto bandwagon without thinking about risk adjusted returns, they will just as quickly jump on whatever bandwagon will be used to blame for the deflation of the bubble, whether the blame is assigned to Wall Steet and Bitcoin futures or Asians or some government. 

Nobody who pumped money into garbage without any use case or utility will accept that they themselves and their own unreasonable expectations for returns were the reason for the gross mispricing of most cryptocurrencies.

#Risk Management
---------------------------

Quanitifying risk in crypto is surprisingly difficult because the historical returns aren't normally distributed, meaning that tools like Sharpe Ratio and other risk metrics can't really be used as intended. Instead you'll have to think of your own risk tolerance and qualitatively evaluate how risky each crypto is based on the team, the use case prospects, the amount of competition and the general market risk. 

You can think of each crypto having a risk factor that is the summation of the general crypto market risk (Rm) as ultimately everything is tied to how Bitcoin does, but also its own inherent risk specific to its own goals (Ri).

Rt = Rm +Ri

The market risk is something you cannot avoid, if some China FUD comes out about regulations on Bitcoin then your investment in solid altcoin picks will go down too along with Bitcoin. This (Rm) return is essentially what risk you undertake to have a market ROI of 385% I talked about above. What you can minimize though is the Ri, the aset specific risks with the team, the likelihood they will actually deliver, the likelihood that their solution will be adopted. Unfortunately there is no one way to do this, you simply have to take the time to research and form your own opinion on how risky it really is before allocating a certain percentage to it. Consider the individual risk of each crypto and start looking for red flags:

* guaranteed promises of large returns (protip: that's a Ponzi)

* float allocations that give way too much to the founder

* vague whitepapers

* vague timelines

* no clear use case

* Github with no useful code and sparse activity

* a team that is difficult to find information on or even worse anonymous

While all cryptocurrencies are a risky investments but generally you can break down cryptos into ""low"" risk core, medium risk speculative and high risk speculative

* Low Risk Core - This is the exchange pairing cryptos and those that are well established. These are almost sure to be around in 5 years, and will recover after any bear market. Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum are in this class of risk, and I would also argue Monero. 

* Medium Risk Speculative - These would be cryptos which generally have at least some product and are reasonably established, but higher risk than Core. Things like ZCash, Ripple, NEO..etc. 

* High Risk Speculative - This is anything created within the last few months, low caps, shillcoins, ICOs...etc. Most cryptos are in this category, most of them will be essentially worthless in 5 years.

How much risk should you take on? That depends on your own life situation but also it should be proportional to how much expertise you have in both financial analysis and technology. If you're a newbie who doesn't understand the tech and has no idea how to value assets, your risk tolerance should be lower than a programmer who understand the tech or a financial analyst who is experienced in valuation metrics. 

Right now the trio of BTC-ETH-LTC account for 55% of the market cap, so between 50-70% of your portfolio in low Risk Core for newbies is a great starting point. Then you can go down to 25-30% as you gain confidence and experience. But always try to keep about 1/3rd in safe core positions. Don't go all in on speculative picks.

**Core principles to minimize risk**

* Have the majority of your holdings in things you feel good holding for at least 2 years. Don't use the majority of your investment for day trading or short term investing.

* Consider using dollar cost averaging to enter a position. This generally means investing a X amount over several periods, instead of at once. You can also use downward biased dollar cost averaging to mitigate against downward risk. For example instead of investing $1000 at once in a position at market price, you can buy $500 at the market price today then set several limit orders at slightly lower intervals (for example $250 at 5% lower than market price, $250 at 10% lower than market price). This way your average cost of acquisition will be lower if the crypto happens to decline over the short term.

* Never chase a pump. Its simply too risky as its such an inefficient and unregulated market. If you continue to do it, most of your money losing decisions will be because you emotionally FOMO-ed into gambling on a symbol.

* Invest what you can afford to lose. Don't have more than 5-10% of your net worth in crypto.

* Consider what level of loss you can't accept in a position with a high risk factor, and use stop-limit orders to hedge against sudden crashes. Set you stop price at about 5-10% above your lowest limit. Stop-limit orders aren't perfect but they're better than having no hedging strategy for a risky microcap in case of some meltdown. Only you can determine what bags you are unwilling to hold.

* Diversify across sectors and rebalance your allocations periodically. Keep about 1/3rd in low risk core holdings.

* Have some fiat in reserve at a FDIC-insured exchange (ex. Gemini), and be ready to add to your winning positions on a pullback.

* Remember you didn't actually make any money until you take some profits, so take do some profits when everyone else is at peak FOMO-ing bubble mode. You will also sleep much more comfortably once you take out the equivalent of your principal.



#Portfolio Allocation
---------------------------------------------

Along with thinking about your portfolio in terms of risk categories described above, I really find it helpful to think about the segments you are in. [OnChainFX](http://onchainfx.com/) has some segment categorization but I generally like to bring it down to:

* Core holdings - essentially the Low Risk Core segment

* Platform segment

* Privacy segment

* Finance/Bank settlement segment 

* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment

* Promising/Innovative Tech segment 

This is merely what I use, but I'm sure you can think of your own. The key point I have is to try to invest your medium and high risk picks in a segment you understand well, and in which you can relatively accurately judge risk. If you don't understand anything about how banking works or SWIFT or international settlement layers, don't invest in Stellar. If you have no idea how a supply chain functions, avoid investing in VeChain (even if it's being shilled to death on Reddit at the moment just like XRB was last month). 

What's interesting is that often we see like-coin movement, for example when a coin from one segment pumps we will frequently see another similar coin in the same segment go up (think Stellar following after Ripple).

Consider the [historic correlations between your holdings](https://cointrading.ninja/correlation). Generally when Bitcoin pumps, altcoins dump but at what rate depends on the coin. When Bitcoin goes sideways we tend to see pumping in altcoins, while when Bitcoin goes down, everything goes down.

You should set price targets for each of your holdings, which is a whole separate discussion I'll go in Part 2 of the guide.

#Summing it up
-------------------------------------

This was meant to get you think about what return targets you should set for your portfolio and how much risk you are willing to take and what strategies you can follow to mitigate that risk. 

Returns around 385% (average crypto market CAGR over the last 3 years) would be a good target to aim for while remaining realistic, you can tweak it a bit based on your own risk tolerance. What category of risk your individual crypto picks should be will be determined by how much more greed you have for above average market return. A portfolio of 50% core holdings, 30% medium risk in a sector you understand well and 20% in high risk speculative is probably what the average portfolio should look like, with newbies going more towards 70% core and only 5% high risk speculative. 

Just by thinking about these things you'll likely do better than most crypto investors, because most don't think about this stuff, to their own detriment.

TRX,CryptoMarkets,Are there any successful memecoins on the not Ethereum blockchain?,"Hi guys! I'm not a memecoin holder because I don't really believe in the upside potential of these coins (which often turn out to be a scam). And this cryptocurrency market bypassed me in 2019-20. And now, buying a new memcoin on the ethereum network will cost me a fortune, because the risks + gwei price leave much to be desired. But my question is not about that.

Most often, such coins appear on decentralized swaps such as UNI, 1inch, where investment in such projects is simply outrageous.

What can you advise me on where to find cheap new, interesting memecoins? Perhaps there are many of them on the BSC or Sol network? Perhaps similar projects also appear on other blockchains, which allow transactions to be carried out instantly without huge commissions. For example Near or TRX?

TRX,CryptoMarkets,Funds never arrived from Binance to Coinbase,"Guys, I'm tearing my hair out trying to understand what went wrong and coinbase support cannot seems to give me a conclusive answer so maybe you guys might.  
A few days ago I bought USDT on Binance to send it to Coinbase wallet app, this was done through Tron, Coinbase has a unique wallet for sending USDT on TRON so it'd convert to USDC on Base, so I've done this a couple of times before without any problems until about a few days ago when the funds never arrived.  
I've spoken to the Coinbase support but they tell me ""Coinbase doesn't support Tron"" and I understand that however, I didn't send it to my coinbase wallet but rather the unique wallet for the conversion (If you guys have the Coinbase wallet app you can check it out by just clicking recieve and checking all the different ways to recieve) appearently the Coinbase support don't know about this??????  
In any case, they stated that if i used my seed phrase on a wallet that supports tron I could recover my funds, this however didn't work on trustwallet, tronlink, or kleverwallet so what in the f are they even talking about?

If you can look, you can see that it's been transferred however it's like Coinbase didn't hold up their end of the bargain by converting, it looks like I have a bit of TRX that should've been used for gas fee's but it's just stuck.

Coins in the Top 10 get the most attention - and I’ve observed huge money pumping into coins that have a “perceived” low entry point - iota, xrp, ada. 

Psychological small investors think they are getting a better deal and can make a lot more money. Whales know that people are thinking this, so they pump billlions into these coins which lights the fire to bring the masses - like a moth to a light.

Stellar is primed - it’s now a top 10 coin with the lowest perceived entry point by a long shot. Combine that with the fact it’s backed by IBM, Wells Fargo and has just announced the FairX app on the horizon.

If there is a top 10 coin that is going to explode in Jan it’s Stellar. Don’t say I didn’t give you the heads up, I don’t see a more obvious investement for massive returns.",152,2017-12-31 03:08:05,119

TRX,Bitcoin,Bitcoin is stronger now than it was when it was at ATH,"Two words; Zoom out. A year ago, the price was hovering over $1000. We bubbled. We rose far too quickly. That kind of rise isn't sustainable.

Lightning network is now on mainnet and is improving as each day goes by. 

Sure, the bubble has popped and yes we could see even lower prices, but realise that this digital asset has already died 100 deaths, and only comes back battle-hardened each time. 

The real MVP's are the ones with their heads in code, and others that continue to support the network. 

Price is a huge indicator, I get it but I believe that in years to come, all this misery, fud and despair will be looked at with regret, regret that these prices weren't taken advantage off. 

We've been here before, we'll no doubt go here again, but bitcoin is anti-fragile. 

There are lots of extremely influential people, family offices, hedge funds and many more invested in this. There are whales out there ready to munch your coins, getting ready for the next pump.

TRX,Bitcoin,china pension fund invest korea bitcoin mining enterprise e-tron,"이트론  이 비트코인같은 암호화폐 채굴사업 본격화 소식에 급등세다. 

18일 오후 1시10분 현재 이트론은 전날보다 79원(13.08%) 오른 683원을 기록중이다.

이날 이트론은 “암호화폐 운영공간 공사계획을 확정하고 올해까지 총 75대의 채굴머신을 설치한다”며 “내년 1월중 25대의 추가 채굴머신을 설치, 곧 바로 시범운영에 들어갈 계획”이라고 밝혔다.

이트론은 지난 12일 암호화폐 채굴기 업체 코인플렉스를 통해 암호화폐 채굴머신 100대를 도입하는 계약을 체결했다.

이트론은 암호화폐 채굴 센터를 구축하고, 이르면 내년 1월 본격적인 운영에 들어갈 방침이다. 

이화전기공업이 자회사인 이필름과 이트론을 중국 연기금 펀드에 매각하는 방안을 검토하고 있다. 중국 연기금측은 이들 회사를 인수해 중국내 확산되고 있는 한류를 이용, 화장품 전문 유통업에 진출하려는 것으로 알려졌다.

19일 M&A업계에 따르면 이화전기 (350원 상승45 14.8%)는 최근 중국 연기금 펀드와 자회사 이필름과 이트론 (686원 상승8 -1.1%) 매각을 위한 협상을 시작했다. 이필름 (1,370원 상승175 14.6%)은 중국내 화장품 사업을 하고 있는 글로벌케이뷰티의 지분 51%를 보유하고 있다.

지난 6월부터 진행된 M&A 협상은 당시 여러 조건이 맞지 않아 중단됐으나, 최근 중국 연기금펀드측에서 M&A 조건을 변경하며 다시 협상이 진행되고 있다.

지난 6월 당시 중국 펀드측은 이화전기가 보유하고 있는 이필름 지분 10.21%와 경영권을 200억원에 인수하는 조건을 제시했다. 최근에는 이필름 지분과 이필름의 자회사 이트론의 지분 10%를 포함해 총 250억원에 인수하는 조건으로 수정 제안 한 것으로 알려졌다.

M&A 업계 관계자는 ""중국 펀드측에서 한류를 이용해 중국내 한국화장품 유통사업 진출을 검토하고 있다""며 ""중국내 600여개의 매장을 내고 여기에 안정적인 물량을 공급받고, 한국 주식시장에서 여러 딜들을 진행하기 위해 한국 상장사 인수를 검토하고 있는 것으로 안다""고 말했다.

중국 펀드측은 지난 6월 담당 총재가 직접 한국을 방문해 구체적인 계약조건까지 검토한 상황이다. 

하지만 양측은 매각조건을 세부적으로 검토하던 중 조건이 맞지 않아 결렬을 선언했다. 중국 연기금 펀드가 이필름의 경영권 인수계약 이전에 중국 정부로부터 승인을 받아야 한다며 다소 무리인 조건을 제시했기 때문이다.

원점으로 돌아갔던 이번 딜이 재협상으로 이어진 것은 중국측이 제시한 조건이 달라진데다 이화전기측의 입장도 달라졌기 때문이다.

M&A 업계 관계자는 ""중국 연기금 펀드측은 이미 중국에 유통회사를 설립해 놓은 상태인 것으로 안다""며 ""특히 중국측은 이필름의 자회사인 글로벌케이뷰티의 가능성을 높이 사고 있기 때문""이라고 설명했다.

이필름의 자회사인 글로벌케이뷰티는 최근 중국 온오프라인 시장에 화장품 및 생활용품 등을 공급을 추진하고 있다.

글로벌케이부티는 지난 11월 중국 상하이 힐튼 호텔에서 링보 보세구역의 링보입형당국제무역유한공사(이하 릭쉐어·LICSHARE)와 연간 7000만달러(약 754억원)의 화장품 및 생활용품 상품공급과 관련된 업무협약(MOU)를 체결했다.

이필름측은 글로벌케이뷰티가 진행하고 있는 방송매체 및 VOD를 마케팅수단으로 활용한 한국화장품의 중국시장 진출에 주력한다는 계획이다.",0,2014-12-21 07:14:40,3

TRX,Bitcoin,Bitcoin confession: I lost half a million euros because of a keylogger.,"This was December 2017. I had around 30 btc plus 20 ETH and was managing funds from three other friends which were around 30,000€ at that time.

I had most funds in a ledger nano, and a few erc20 tokens and eth in metamask and mew.

I had caught the huge wave of Tron and had held btc since 600€, put myself in debt for it.

I remember importing my ledger to electrum and entering the seed. Few days later, everything was gone. Someone was probably monitoring me for long and my antivirus software never found any keylogger. I looked to the other accounts, also gone.

This was around 18 December I think. I entered a spiral of depression and shame. I couldn't believe it. I wanted to die.

TRX,Bitcoin,Hal Finney,"I did a write up for an article about the possible whereabouts of Satoshi Nakamoto. I have already written about Nick Szabo, Dorian Nakamoto, and Dave Kleiman. Im writing about Hal now and I thought you may enjoy it.

Hal Finney

Hal Finney was quite influential in the beginning of Bitcoin. He received the first BTC transaction from “Satoshi Nakamoto”. But I am getting ahead of myself. Lets start at the beginning. Hal was born on May 4, 1956. He began his computer-centric career developing console video games. This really intrigued me, as I was a huge fan of console gaming back in the 80’s. Games like “Adventures of Tron (ironic I know), Armor Ambush, and Space Attack. Hal eventually left the console world to focus on cryptography. He became a developer for the PGP corporation (Which happened to be one of the first publicly available implementations of public-key cryptography) This allowed people to chat with each other via computer with encryption ensuring a secure connection. When you see the goal of PGP it is no wonder why Hal got involved with Bitcoin. He had been in cryptography for decades before Bitcoin was ever thought of. As a regular poster on the Cypherpunks mailing list. If you are a fan of cryptocurrency and you don’t know who or what “Cypherpunk” was I suggest you do a bit of research. These were the people that blazed the way for Bitcoin. I am quite certain that without this group of computer geniuses we would still be stuck with no other alternative than fiat. Fast forward to 2004 and you would witness the first creation of a reusable proof of work system. This predated Bitcoin by at least 5 years. This is one reason many folks believe Hal was in fact Satoshi Nakamoto. A statement that Hal repeatedly denied while he was alive. As far back as 1993 Hal was discussing a solution for solving the “double spend” issue that plagued the precursors to Bitcoin. Hal was a visionary, as he could see the issues cryptocurrency would face and started trying to solve them long before Bitcoin was ever implemented. Hal’s writing about “reusable proof of work” can be seen at the following link: [https://nakamotoinstitute.org/rpow/](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/rpow/). The actual website can be found here for Hal’s project (which is now terminated) [https://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/index.html](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/index.html). Hal was a known cypherpunk for decades and when Bitcoin came along, it was natural for Hal to be involved. He has every qualification to claim the name Satoshi Nakamoto, that is for sure. But lets focus on what we do know about him. He actually lived in the same city as Dorian Nakamoto (I discussed him in my last write up “Part 1”) This added fuel to the flames that Hal or Dorian were Satoshi, and they may or may not have worked together. Of course, it is speculation, but it is interesting none the less. Hal and Satoshi communicated regularly through email about BTC and these emails are now a part of the history of BTC. Some claim Hal was actually emailing himself in order to hide his tracks and cover up the fact that Hal was actually Satoshi, which is possible. Hal was a giant in the cryptography and cryptocurrency fields. If I were to personally come out and call anyone Satoshi it would be Hal Finney (Just my personal opinion). The history of Bitcoin would be incomplete without mentioning Hal Finney. Sadly Hal contracted Lou Gehrig’s disease and decided to announce the diagnosis publicly in October 2009.  Even with death being a certainty Hal persisted and continued his work, even while using breathing assistance and being restricted to a wheelchair, until his death in August of 2014. His death was a blow to everyone that appreciated cryptography and knew of this brilliant mind. Hal selflessly sacrificed his time and efforts to ensure privacy would not disappear in the age of growing computer dominance. If you like Bitcoin, you should be thankful for Hal Finney. He was very influential in the creation of cryptocurrencies (Perhaps he was Satoshi) One thing we do know is we don’t know if it was Hal or not. Hal was a smart fella that could have very easily hidden his tracks. Hal was an advocate for privacy and for that I salute him. Thank you for your contributions Mr. Finney. Your legacy will live on through the next generation of developers you have inspired through your work. Rest in peace sir, your journey through life helped the world. We should all be thankful.",153,2019-03-25 11:57:04,96

TRX,Bitcoin,RGB for Lightning Network. I'm so excited.,"""The classic example is CryptoKitties, those breedable NFT felines minted on the Ethereum network. Another perhaps less-familiar example comes from the RarePepe cards issued on Bitcoin using the Counterparty protocol.

RGB could have a leg up on these forms of NFTs because RGB would allow you to send the computer file for the NFT in the same transaction as the asset that represents it. When you send a CryptoKitty as an ERC-721 token on Ethereum or a RarePepe “colored coin” on Bitcoin, the file for the actual collectible has to be transferred separately. With RGB, both asset and collectible can be “sent inside the same channel,” Zucco claimed.

A more salient use case for RGB, according to Zucco, would come from issuing tether on the protocol. Since all transactions are handled off-chain, Zucco said RGB carries with it the promise to be possibly more private than even the Lightning Network.

For something like the stablecoin tether, whose on-chain address on blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS and Tron can be easily tracked and, in extreme scenarios, blacklisted, this could bolster tether’s privacy and censorship resistance.""

TRX,Bitcoin,Sticking to Just BTC,"I was quite late to the crypto space having made my first purchase in April 2018, I've invested heavily since though. When I first got in to crypto I bought lots of different cryptocurrencies, this is because when J first got in to crypto people was saying that ""all boats will rise"" and that basically you'll make money investing in any project as blockchain is the future. Obviously that turned out to be very wrong. My first purchase was some Ethereum, after though I bought some Bitcoin and then Litecoin. As time went on I ended up buying many currencies such as XRP (hated it even when I bought it), Cardano, Monero, TRON, Dash and ARK (awful investment). As time went on I found myself losing trust in many alts so I was swapping them for BTC until about a year later I held just BTC and ETH. In all honesty I love ETH and I'm not for one second saying it's going to fail because I don't think so, but right now I'm happy with the money I have and I don't see the risk worth it when it has so many competitors that are faster and more scalable etc. I'm confident ETH will do well in the future and if so it may have more upside than BTC in the short to mid-term but I'm certain BTC is here to stay, I'm happier with a safer investment.

I know some people may say after just one year maybe I didn't give some of these projects like Cardano enough time, and that may be true I admit. Also I want to clear the air on the whole profits bit at the end, not to sound cliche but I do care about the tech and the movement behind BTC, I've been in to crypto for almost two year now and I've never once sold and have no intentions in doing so for many years. I am in it for the tech and the movement but obviously I don't want to lose money either! I feel like I'm in a weird situation right now as many people may call me a Bitcoin Maximalist but that's not true, other projects will succeed also but I've reached a point now where I'm not as greedy chasing alts for big gains, I like BTC for what it is and happy to stick with it.",21,2020-02-02 02:39:11,46

TRX,Bitcoin,Toss 15k USD at this or wait?,"Alrighty, so I've been in the crypto game before.

I missed the crash, but managed to sell and profit a little bit. That was back in early 2018. I never really invested in Bitcoin, not then, not now. But now I have the opportunity to throw 15k at it, which would be about half of all the money I own. I'm having some serious doubts about doing this. But at the same time, I feel like this is my only chance to really make some serious money. This year I'll be 35, I'm willing to give this 5, maybe even 10 years to grow. And I'd be willing to throw another 250 bucks at Bitcoin (and 250 into my savings account) every month moving forward. With that said, it still feels like a risky move. So... Yay or nay?

TRX,Bitcoin,Privacy seems like a huge trend in 2020. Can Bitcoin do something about it?,"Seriously, I have heard all around that privacy is gonna be a huge thing in this 2020. Many projects have announced their intentions to switch their cryptos to something called 'privacy mode': TRON, Ethereum, Tezos, Binance Chain or Zilliqa

The question arisen in me right now is that can we have something like a 'privacy Bitcoin'? Like, we can store, send, and receive Bitcoin in completely private just like a truly privacy coin. It is just like an Incognito mode for browsers in which we can switch back and forth between Incognito version and normal version anytime we want. Here is the Incognito mode for Bitcoin.

I know that Bitcoin mixing is a long-standing solution for anonymizing BTC transactions. However, Big Brother is taking a very close look at these services ([https://www.coindesk.com/us-doj-calls-bitcoin-mixing-a-crime-in-arrest-of-software-developer](https://www.coindesk.com/us-doj-calls-bitcoin-mixing-a-crime-in-arrest-of-software-developer)). Also, Bitcoin mixing is a private solution good for only sending & receiving, right? How about storing? I sometimes put my name along with my BTC personal address on some blog sites for donation, so the information in my wallet (how many I have, my previous transactions) is still can be tracked, right?

So, is the idea of an Incognito mode for Bitcoin cool? I think it would be very popular if there are some teams looking at it and seriously developing it.",9,2020-02-16 01:16:41,33

**We've got to start thinking in satoshis.**

We're already doing it to a degree. Several places are selling things denoted in sats. This is good. It avoids decimal confusion such as 0.00000375 BTC. It's much easier to say, ""375 sats.""

In part, this is why I've long pushed for sats as the default unit and for the ""shi"" symbol シ to represent it. See [why use シ for sats?](http://satoshibitcoinconverter.com/why.htm) and [Satoshi Day](http://satoshibitcoinconverter.com/satoshiday.htm).

2,100,000,000,000,000 is 2.1 quadrillion. That may look like a lot. But hah! Don't think small. One million dollars used to be amazing. Now we talk in numbers like $2.5Billion or $1.3T. Understand, 2.1Q is nothing in terms of sats.

By comparison, consider USD pennies. The U.S. government magically fashions trillions of dollars out of thin air for every ""crisis"" that comes up, calling it ""Quantitative Easing"" or ""QE."" ""BRRRRR,"" says the paper money printer. Since there are 100 pennies in every dollar, that's trillions of dollars multiplied TIMES 100. 2.1Q is nothing in terms of sats.

In the U.S., we hear of QE1, and QE2, and QE3, and QE4, and...

Instead of QE,...

If you've been keeping up with this, the drop was artificially created to liquidate 1 stakeholder of BTC so they could buy in at a extremely low price

I believe this person is Justin Sun (FOUNDER OF TRON) who has a $1B stake in BTC

There was a 2 min Window where liquidity protocol went into recovery mode and that $1B stake COULD OF been Liquidated BUT IT DIDENT HAPPEN

He rebalanced his TROVE and Paid back $300m of debt

**FORBES: ""El Salvador To Make Bitcoin Legal Tender: A Milestone In Monetary History""**


> On June 5, at a conference in Miami, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced that the Central American country is in the process of adopting bitcoin as legal tender: a move that would make El Salvador the first country to deem bitcoin an official national currency. Despite El Salvador’s small size, Bukele’s effort is a major milestone in monetary policy history, one with significant ramifications for the global financial system.
> 
> ‘Potentially helping billions around the world’ 
> At the Bitcoin 2021 conference, Bukele described his legislative proposal as a way to “design a country for the future.” On Twitter, he pointed out that if 1 percent of the world’s bitcoin moved to El Salvador, it would amount to a quarter of the country’s annual economic output. 
> 
> 
> And Bukele is not engaging in wishful thinking. Each year, Salvadoran emigrants send $6 billion home in remittances, from places like the United States. Indeed, 2.2 million people of Salvadoran ancestry live in the U.S., compared with 6.5 million in El Salvador itself. Today, Salvadoran emigrés’ remittances must travel back through middlemen who take cuts as large as 20 percent. “By using bitcoin,” tweeted Bukele, “the amount received by more than a million low income families will increase in the equivalent of billions of dollars every year.”
> 
> 70 percent of Salvadorans lack bank accounts, Bukele noted. Because people can transmit bitcoin to relatives and businesses on their smartphones, without the need for a bank account, the move to make Bitcoin legal tender could help achieve the “moral imperative” of financial inclusion, and provide “a space where some of the leading innovators can reimagine the future of finance, potentially helping billions around the world.”
> 
> The political party Bukele founded, Nuevas Ideas, controls 56 seats out of 84 in El Salvador’s legislative assembly, the Asamblea Legislativa, making it likely that Bukele’s bitcoin initiative is enacted into law.
> 
> Why El Salvador is adopting Bitcoin 
> El Salvador’s interest in adopting bitcoin as legal tender has other powerful economic rationales.
> 
> In 2001, after a long period of instability, El Salvador replaced the Salvadoran colón with the U.S. dollar. Indeed, dozens of countries either peg their currencies to the value of the U.S. dollar or use the greenback outright, especially those with heavy trade or tourism relationships with the U.S., such as the nations of the Caribbean Sea, and oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

> Overall, this system has worked fine for El Salvador, but recently things have taken a turn for the worse. In an effort to blunt the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. Federal Reserve has dramatically expanded the supply of circulating U.S. dollars, as measured by the M2 money stock, from $15.35 trillion in February 2020 to $20.26 trillion in May 2021. That’s an increase of 32 percent, unprecedented in modern peacetime U.S. history.
> 
> From February 2020 to May 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve has increased the circulating supply by a proportion unprecedented in peacetime history.
> From February 2020 to May 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve has increased the circulating supply of U.S. dollars by a proportion unprecedented in peacetime history. FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST. LOUIS
> While the Fed’s extraordinary measures succeeded in pumping more cash into the coffers of U.S. financial institutions, the stock market, and other aspects of the U.S. economy, the same was not true for Salvadorans, whose banks did not receive infusions from the Fed, but did lose purchasing power due to U.S. monetary inflation.
> 
> Indeed, Bukele’s proposal states that “central banks [like the U.S. Federal Reserve] are increasingly taking actions that may cause harm to the economic stability of El Salvador…in order to mitigate the negative impact of central banks, it becomes necessary to authorize the circulation of a digital currency with a supply that cannot be controlled by any central bank and is only altered in accord with objective and calculable criteria.” The supply of bitcoin is capped at 21 million units, making the digital currency immune to the types of policy changes that affect the U.S. dollar and other “fiat” currencies.
> 
> Bitcoin thought leaders are working with the Salvadoran government 
> The Salvadoran marriage to Bitcoin has been two years in the making. Bitcoin entrepreneur Jack Mallers, who helped build the Lightning Network to facilitate fast, low-cost bitcoin transactions, has been working with Bukele and other Salvadorans to make bitcoin a feasible means of exchange for everyday purchases.
> 
> Another crypto entrepreneur, Adam Back of Blockstream, told CNBC that he “plans to contribute technologies like Liquid,” which like Lightning can speed up bitcoin transactions, “and satellite infrastructure to make El Salvador a model for the world.” Satellites can help rural Salvadorans connect to the internet, and thereby to the Bitcoin network, in places where land-based connectivity is poor.
> 
> Mallers has been working to increase Salvadoran adoption of his smartphone app Strike, a Lightning-powered analog to Venmo or Cash App. In 2019, thanks to a anonymous donation, crypto entrepreneurs founded Bitcoin Beach, as a way to pilot in El Salvador a circular Bitcoin economy in which residents and businesses transact entirely in bitcoin, without conversions to and from U.S. dollars. 
> 
> In a press release, Strike stated “making bitcoin legal tender is a leapfrog moment that can help countries like El Salvador shift from a largely cash economy to an innovative, inclusive, and transparent digital economy where your bank account is your phone.” Mallers described the Salvadoran move as the “shot heard ’round the world” because it would provide “a way to protect developing economies from potential shocks of fiat currency inflation.”
> 
> Could El Salvador become the world capital of the Bitcoin ecosystem? 
> Alongside the potential for Salvadoran emigrants to send remittances back to their home country, the move by El Salvador to make bitcoin legal tender could also attract western and Asian crypto entrepreneurs. “Crypto investors and entrepreneurs will start to move to El Salvador!” tweeted Justin Sun, founder of cryptocurrency platform TRON. “Amazing! Packing now!”
> 
> Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, tweeted a GIF of Mickey Mouse hurriedly tossing clothes into a suitcase, implicitly heading to El Salvador.
> 
> 
> In 2019, according to the World Bank, El Salvador ranked 115th out of 186 countries in annual gross domestic product per capita on a purchasing power parity-adjusted basis, with $9,164. A handful of crypto billionaires moving to El Salvador could transform the country. 
> 
> Ireland was once one of the poorest countries in Europe; beginning in 1996, Ireland reduced its corporate tax rate from 40% to 12.5%, resulting in a multi-decadal economic boom as large multinationals relocated to the Emerald Isle. In 2019, Ireland’s PPP-adjusted GDP climbed to 4th in the world at $89,684, ahead of the 8th-ranked U.S. ($65,298) and even 5th-ranked Switzerland ($72,376).
> 
> El Salvador has more to do to replicate Ireland’s success. The Heritage Foundation ranked the country 94th out of 184 countries in its 2021 Index of Economic Freedom, dinging El Salvador’s “uneven” protection of property rights and inconsistent rule of law, noting that “three of the past four presidents have been indicted for corruption.” 
> 
> Earlier this year, President Bukele’s allies in the Asamblea Legislativa voted to replace the five members of El Salvador’s highest court, the Constitutional Court, and also the country’s attorney general. Mary Anastasia O’Grady, Americas columnist at the Wall Street Journal, responded by expressing concern that “under Mr. Bukele El Salvador may be the next Latin domino to fall to authoritarianism.” The U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, led by Samantha Powers, redirected funding from the Salvadoran government to civil society groups.
> 
> In other words, if El Salvador is to become a global crypto capital, entrepreneurs who move there will need to help increase confidence in the country’s legal and economic institutions.
> 
> If El Salvador doesn’t improve quickly, it could face competition. Other countries may follow El Salvador’s lead in adopting bitcoin as legal tender. Most Caribbean nations peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar, for example, and many, like the Cayman Islands, are already well-versed in attracting foreign capital through low tax rates and efficient financial regulation.
> 
> Significant implications for U.S. companies and individuals
> El Salvador’s bitcoin policies will also have significant ramifications for individuals and businesses in the United States and elsewhere. 
> 
> Today, in the U.S., it’s difficult to use bitcoin for ordinary payments, like buying a cup of coffee. That’s because, in 2014, the Internal Revenue Service defined cryptocurrencies as “property for Federal income tax purposes.” As a result, if you use bitcoin at Starbucks, and you purchased that bitcoin a few years ago when its price was lower, under IRS rules you’ve triggered a taxable event for which you have to report capital gains and fill out a cumbersome form. 
> 
> This IRS-imposed friction makes it extremely difficult to use bitcoin for everyday payments in a legally compliant way. On the other hand, if bitcoin is legal tender in the same way that euros and British pounds are, it becomes much easier to use bitcoin for ordinary payments, because the IRS thinks differently about transactions using foreign currencies. 
> 
> Something similar affects large U.S. corporations and financial institutions that wish to hold bitcoin on their balance sheets. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and their parallels abroad long predate the invention of Bitcoin. Today, GAAP regards virtual currencies like bitcoin as “indefinite-lived intangible assets.” In real-world terms, this means that if a company bought one bitcoin at $50,000, and the market price goes down to $35,000, the company must write down the $15,000 loss as an “impairment.” By contrast, if the price of bitcoin goes up to $60,000, the $10,000 appreciation cannot be logged as an unrealized gain. These GAAP accounting quirks basically mean that, from a cosmetic standpoint, owning bitcoin on corporate balance sheets is nothing but downside, even if in reality the value of a company’s bitcoin holdings appreciates substantially.
> 
> The transformation by El Salvador of bitcoin into legal tender, i.e, a foreign currency, makes the accounting treatment much more straightforward, enabling every corporation in America to hold bitcoin in the same way that it holds other forms of cash. Such a change could dramatically increase the utility of bitcoin for corporate treasury management.
> 
> Most importantly, El Salvador’s decision has ramifications for one of the greatest sources of skepticism for Bitcoin’s staying power: the theory that the U.S. will ban the digital currency if it ever becomes a true competitor to the U.S. dollar. “Bitcoin’s greatest risk is its success,” said Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, at the Consensus cryptocurrency conference in May. But banning the official national currency of another country would be an unprecedented step for the U.S., one that could, on its own, undermine the greenback’s utility as the world’s premier fiat currency. 
> 
> El Salvador may be the smallest country in North America. But if President Bukele’s bitcoin proposal becomes law, El Salvador could become one of the most significant monetary centers in the world.",19,2021-06-08 05:34:13,4

TRX,Bitcoin,I recently lost my job and I want to recycle myself and make conferences to talk about Bitcoin and Blockchain.,"So my idea is to rent some decent rooms and make a course about Bitcoin, Blockchain and how it is going to impact the world within the coming years and of course  its evolution until now. I would have to charge a little bit as I will have to spend money to rent places for the conferences. 

What would be the best approach to gain some attention? It would be in France in one of the major city and will be very educational.

I am aiming people who don't know much about it and are interested in other option than the current financial system.

I think that one of my strenght beside my knowledge about the topic are all the mistakes I made during the past 5 years in crypto and I could help those people to avoid them, such as detecting scams, securing properly, not buying shitcoins with no future. I'm not a Bitcoin Nazi, meaning I also believe in few other project such as Ethereum and few more, but not XRP or Tron don't worry.

If someone if willing to help in making a design of flyers or also posters that I could spread in my area to make people aware of the events, I would really appreciate and ofc pay in Satoshis for the service.

I really want to spread the word about Bitcoin as too many people still don't understand it or totally ignore it.",16,2020-06-13 20:04:30,8

TRX,Bitcoin,"The fundamentals are so good that Bitcoin breaks through $50,000","In the afternoon of the 14th, Bitcoin started to increase in volume from 47,500 USD, quickly broke through the previous high of 48974, and then began to fall back.

&#x200B;

On the 15th, Bitcoin once again rushed higher, failed again, and then plummeted to $45,688. For example, the DeFi concept currency flashed, and the market was worried, and the market would take a sharp turn.

&#x200B;

On the 16th, the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese lunar calendar, the God of Wealth Festival, Chinese people usually ""welcome the God of Wealth"", and then set off firecrackers, hang lanterns, burn incense, and send paper money to pray for the coming year. As a result, the market sentiment in the morning was more optimistic, but Bitcoin fell again to around $57,000 in the morning. Near noon, Bitcoin began to violently rush higher. After a slight rounding around 49500, the 50,000 mark was successfully won.

&#x200B;

But as of press time, the highest Bitcoin spot on OK Exchange is $50,000, Huobi Exchange is $4,9999.99, and Binance Exchange is $49,998. Obviously, $50,000 is a significant pressure.

&#x200B;

Why can Bitcoin break 50,000? If you look at it from a macro perspective, this is almost a certainty. Compared with 2017, Bitcoin's fundamentals are already overwhelmingly good. The continuous breakthroughs are not unexpected by the market. What is unexpected is that Bitcoin runs blindfolded without a callback.

&#x200B;

In 2019, a Bitcoin ETF made the entire market excited, but today, only 2 years later, who can believe that ETF has not come, Grayscale, Paypal, Tesla...all have come.

&#x200B;

Bitcoin's global attention today, placed 2 years ago, who can imagine it?

&#x200B;

Fundamentals are so good that European and American capital markets continue to be ""good""

Many people must have seen the fundamentals of Bitcoin. Let's briefly review these recent hot news events. Looking at the leopard in the tube, a leaf knows autumn, can you see the ""flavor of change""?

&#x200B;

1. On February 14th, Counterpoint Global, the investment arm of Morgan Stanley, is discussing whether to bet on Bitcoin. This means that the true leader-level Wall Street financial institutions and the main players in global finance have shifted their perspective to Bitcoin, and the concept of Bitcoin as a digital asset has successfully entered the mainstream financial world. Compared with how much dollars Morgan Stanley will spend to deploy Bitcoin, its social impact is far more significant.

&#x200B;

2. In January, Miami, the second largest city in Florida, USA, uploaded the Bitcoin white paper to the municipal website. In February, the Mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, revealed on Twitter that he was studying to allocate a portion of his municipal financial reserves to Bitcoin. At the same time, the founder of Bitcoin Advisory tweeted that the U.S. Treasury Department already holds 70,000 Bitcoins. Perhaps, starting from municipal funds, then to national sovereign funds, and then to the central bank, this path will be much faster than the public imagined.

&#x200B;

3. At the ""Investor Day 2021"" event, PayPal Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer Jonathan Auerbach stated that PayPal will increase support for more customers around the world to access cryptocurrencies and digital currencies during the year, making cryptocurrencies a global digital currency. A financing tool for millions of corporate transactions. In other words, it is no longer far away for the public to purchase cryptocurrencies through the ""international version of Alipay"" PayPal.

&#x200B;

4. American compliance exchange Coinbase announced its listing on NASDAQ. Olaf Carlson-Wee, CEO of crypto investment company Polychain Capital, said that Coinbase is valued at more than US$100 billion. As a result, the leaders of multiple cryptocurrency tracks such as mining machines, exchanges, and investment have begun to land in the U.S. stock capital market. At the same time, non-cryptocurrency-listed companies are madly entering.

&#x200B;

5. On February 9, Tether issued a total of 1 billion USDT on the TRON network. In this regard, Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino said that this is an authorized but not issued transaction, which means that the amount will be used as inventory for the next issuance request. As of February 14, the total market value of USDT exceeded US$32 billion, which is approximately US$32.01 billion. Tether continues to ""print money"", which may be the vane of funds entering the market.

&#x200B;

6. Looking at the entire cryptocurrency market, since the beginning of the Chinese New Year, almost every track, including DeFi coins, exchange platform coins, Chinese public chain coins, etc., has ushered in a round of skyrocketing, which has been jokingly called by Weibo big V , The cryptocurrency market is giving Chinese investors a new year red envelope.

&#x200B;

Looking back in history, Bitcoin is trading sideways and other cryptocurrencies are skyrocketing. Then, the final result will either collapse or return to Bitcoin with smart funds, which will further raise Bitcoin's historical high and complete the real bull market evolution.

&#x200B;

Wan Hui: Institutions are out of the bull market

We know that, before this, Tesla announced that it has invested 1.5 billion US dollars to configure Bitcoin and plans to accept cryptocurrency as a payment method. Elon Musk left a message on Twitter: One coin rules everything.

&#x200B;

Many people cannot understand the meaning of this matter. We take Wanhui’s latest interpretation as follows:

&#x200B;

""Putting Bitcoin into the balance sheet of Tesla's size and influential companies, and Musk's use of his own money to buy Bitcoin for this kind of asset endorsement significance is not an order of magnitude. So what to see Gou Zhuang pulls, narrow cognition such as cutting leek or weird conspiracy theories are really nothing to say.

&#x200B;

Tesla, as a constituent stock of S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, carries the idol-level company that the ""next Apple"" is looking forward to, and has close to 10% of its cash reserves (it should be more than 10% now, bought It is 7% at the time) to allocate an alternative asset in the traditional sense of alternative assets. For Tesla, which is close to the brink of bankruptcy, it is a nuclear bomb level decision.

&#x200B;

This kind of decision involves a series of preparations such as board decision-making, corporate governance, finance, auditing, legal affairs, taxation, etc., and the time and energy required before and after cannot be done by Musk alone. When MicroStrategy did this operation in the past, in order to unify the consistency of the shareholders, it also provided a repurchase plan, that is, if there are shareholders who do not approve the asset allocation decision, the company will provide a repurchase. ""

&#x200B;

In fact, when Tesla announced the deployment of Bitcoin, some practitioners commented: Since then, the two worlds have been integrated and will no longer be separated.

&#x200B;

In the cryptocurrency investment circle, practitioners, especially investors, often use ""zhuang"" to imply some people's extreme control over the market. Obviously, this is widespread. However, if the underlying asset of Bitcoin is still used to understand and invest in this way, it may be completely out of date. The result is likely to be the air.

&#x200B;

Bitcoin, before 2020, most practitioners claim that it is digital gold, and there may not be many people who truly believe that it is digital gold. After 2020, when it becomes digital gold, many people are actually afraid. I don't believe it anymore.

&#x200B;

As an asset, it is an indisputable fact that Bitcoin is entering the mainstream view, but does this mean that Bitcoin will really enter the eternal bull market? Obviously, in a longer period of time, even a large price fluctuation may become a smooth arc, but in a short period of time, even a 20% fluctuation may kill many people.",11,2021-02-16 18:15:00,2

TRX,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin price is close to $13,000"," 

The growth of Bitcoin continues rapidly and it doesn’t yet clear what can stop it. On the night of Wednesday, June 26, the price of the first cryptocurrency not only exceeded $12,000 but also came close to $13,000 (+13.5% in the last 24 hours).

So, as of 05:15 UTC, Bitcoin rose by Bitstamp to $12 935, followed by the expected correction.

Capitalization of BTC at the morning peak has reached $228 billion, the index of dominance – of 62.1%. The total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market at the same time reached $365 billion.

The last time trading at this level was on January 21, 2018.

Other leading altcoins are growing in price more restrained, or even show negative trends.

Ethereum rose in price to $330 (+5.3% per day), XRP rose by no more than 1%, reaching $0.473. Bitcoin Cash also rose by about the same amount, breaking the $485 mark.

At the same time, the growth of Bitcoin almost didn’t affect Litecoin, EOS, Binance Coin, Bitcoin SV and Tron – all of them are in the red zone, losing about 1% in price compared to 24-hour ago. Even more by more than 6% fell in the price of Monero.

Experts, meanwhile, warn that the current growth of Bitcoin is likely associated with the Tether pump and that in fact, there is little new money in the first cryptocurrency.

We will remind, literally the day before the price of bitcoin has renewed 15-month high at above $11450.

TRX,Bitcoin,Bitcoin marketcap dominance weighted by real volume,"Since everybody was talking about how bitcoin reveals a much higher market dominance when exchange liquidity is factored last week... but everybody was also talking about how exchange volume was fake... I decided to recalculate the bitcoin liquidity weighted market dominance using corrected 24 hour volume--just cause you were curious. The result is about the same, with Bitcoin looking only slightly more dominant (81%) when using real volume.

TRX,Bitcoin,BitMEX: Good Or Bad for the Bitcoin Market?,"Its pretty evident that the cat is out of the bag and a lot of crypto traders noticed what happened when BitMEX went offline for a brief period during a scheduled maintenance last night. The exchange that has traded over 1 Million Bitcoin (BTC) in a day on two occasions, has been the fan favorite for traders who are taking advantage of the bear market and want to short the digital assets of Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA), EOS, Ethereum (ETH), Tron (TRX) and XRP.

&#x200B;

***​Its also public knowledge amongst traders that # Trading over there is as fast as greased lightning.***

&#x200B;

The million dollar question?? The value of BTC is if BitMEX is a friend or enemy to the general ecosystem of Bitcoin in the crypto markets. One argument that has been postulated is that during that one hour of maintenance on BitMEX, a majority of the short positions in the global crypto markets were inactive. This then means the Bulls had a chance to go long on BTC thus triggering a buying spree and a price increment.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, one may say that shorting Bitcoin and other digital assets is simply destroying the ecosystem and even preventing the SEC from approving ETFs based on the fact that the markets are too volatile. The reason why SEC declined 8 ETF proposals is it aims to at all times prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices, in short mandates to protect investors from shady trading,

&#x200B;

​The other side may argue that Bitmex is the oldest derivatives trading platform and has offered great trading/ investment options and in return also grown exponentially, so instance Bitmex enting the most expensive offices in Hong Kong.

TRX,Bitcoin,"Decipher CoinToBe For Better Product, We Always Go the Extra Mile","Block chain technology is like a new toy in the playground every kid fights for.  Real estate wants a share of it, so does IT industry, investors and the traditional sectors.  The technology itself is now booming, bringing cryptocurrency exchanges along.

In 2017, OKex bitcoin theft, scandal of Tron and the fake coins hit the market hard.

As first published on forbes.com

A week before Christmas, this headline about a random cryptocurrency no one has ever heard of was read more than most best sellers: Asians ‘Going Mad’ For Ripple Coin.  At the time, Ripple (XRP) was worth around a dollar. Today it is worth $2.45.

This will be the year that more unknown cryptocurrencies double in value.  How many will quadruple in value is anybody’s guess.

Sure, many of these new coins will disappear from the market. At their heart, the cryptocurrency craze is like the start-up craze, on steroids. Newly minted companies are going around the venture capital world, issuing their own digital currency, and having almost no problem at all finding willing investors. Got snake oil? No problem! Someone in Asia will take two bottles worth.

While setting up an initial coin offering is not cheap and needs upfront angel investing to foot the bill, the ICO market has turned what was once a half dozen cryptocurrencies led by bitcoin, into a $650 billion market overrun by over a thousand cryptocurrencies. These currencies are tied to new, unknown companies selling products and services no one has ever heard of, understands, and may have no real use for.
 As an investment vehicle, the cryptocoin is the market’s version of a poker chip. If you thought junk bond lords in the 80s were nuts…

Nuts? Oh, really?

The cryptocurrency bubble, if you will, has thousands of nutty investors laughing all the way to the bank. Literally.

If ripple coin has doubled in value, what are the odds of some other coins doubling too? Very high, in fact. Those odds are keeping investors looking down market at lower price coins. There is just too much upside, and no one has yet been willing to come forward to the press to say just how much money they’ve lost. The world is full of stories of people who lost all their money in their new business or saw half their life savings evaporate due to a crashing stock market or a financial swindle. But we have yet to meet the person who lost their shirt on a bitcoin bet.

And if their shirt is the only thing they are losing, then that’s not a cause for concern yet. Until investors come forth with big losses, the trend is your friend in 2018.

Tuesday marked the first trading day of the new year for American cryptocoin investors. Only three of the top 20 coins started off in the red.  Little known coins issued by startups like Tron and China’s NEO are up over 30% as of late Tuesday morning.

Tron is worth a mere six cents. China blockchain platform and Ethereum rival NEO sells for around $100 a coin.

Three years ago, one bitcoin was $15. It’s worth over $15,000 now. If one NEO is worth 3,000% more in 2021, like bitcoin since 2012, then it’s worth the gamble, most investors believe. A $100 loss isn’t putting anyone in the poorhouse.

Ethereum, an early entrant to the blockchain/cryptocurrency buildout, was created by Russian-born tech genius Vitalik Buterin. He’s now a millionaire many times over.

Another Russia,  Pavlov Durov, now residing in Dubai, is rumored to issue coins this year for Telegram, the messaging service most used in the crypto world. Durov did not return requests for comment at this time.

All someone like Durov has to do is look around him and see the money that is being made from nothing.

Pavel Durov is the brainchild behind Telegram, the messaging app most used by cryptocurrency startups. According to the virtual water cooler chatter of the crypto-world, Telegram is planning their own digital currency in a billion-dollar initial coin offering. (AP Photo/Tatan Syuflana, File)

Nearly $3 billion worth of Ethereum’s ether coin was traded between the exchanges in the past 24 hours. The total market capitalization hit $84.12 billion, meaning this Russian developed blockchain is now worth around $15 billion more than Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, Petrobras, a company with over 60 years experience in the oil and gas markets, and one that actually has hard assets worth real money.

That’s no longer a viable comparison. Bitcoin and ripple are worth even more than Petrobras.  Bitcoin’s market cap is the equivalent of Chevron’s. Ripple’s market cap is just shy of Goldman Sachs’.

Alexey Ivanov, fund manager at Polynom Crypto Capital in Moscow, thinks unknown Ethereum competitor Cardano Cryptocurrency will double this year. It’s up over 500% since its ICO in late 2017. One coin goes for just $0.77.

“Once Cardano is added to a regulated platform, it can double,” he says. Volume is next to nothing on that coin because the blockchain infrastructure company is still working on so-called “proof of stake” coding to verify digital transactions.

Ethereum is currently working out the kinks in its own system, to help remove bottlenecks. Ivanov thinks that’s why the coin is up 17% on Tuesday.

David Herne, the American hedge fund manager behind the Specialized Research and Investment Group in Moscow, likes Waves, the Russian developed blockchain startup working with the Moscow Stock Exchange on a pilot program that would allow for trading in cryptos by qualified investors.  That coin goes for $13.21 today and already has a billion dollar market cap.

Buying cryptocurrencies is not liking picking a stock on E-Trade. E-Trade is like the intermediary between an investor and the New York Stock Exchange. There is no such comparable entity in the crypto world. Instead, there are many exchanges, some bigger and better than others.  Not all carry the same digital currencies, and the proof of identification process can day days if not a week to complete. Exchanges like Kraken and Bitstamp, which allow users to buy ripple coin, are spotty. (They were down both times I tried using them last week.)

“Call it a bubble if you like, but can you really afford to stay out of crytocurrencies?” writes Naeem Aslam, chief market strategist for ThinkMarkets in London. He posted his views here on Forbes.com.

* **Cryptomania was unquestionably the major talking point of 2017.  The question is: can you make money while still thinking there is a bubble? Giving a straight answer: if you can afford to lose an amount which won’t make any meaningful difference in your life, then by all means, dabble. An average American aged between 20-64 earns approximately $27-50K a year.  In the grand scheme of things, $100 invested in cryptocurrency has a minuscule probability to impact anyone dramatically. The rewards are undoubtedly there.“**

In 2018, investors are going to spend time discovering newer companies and their coins, especially those that do not cost the price of a new car (think Kia Soul, for instance).

As a result of this trend, bitcoin’s dominance of the cryptocurrency market has fallen to its lowest level in five years. As of now, bitcoin’s market cap is $233.6 billion, accounting for 36% of the total value of all cryptocurrencies. In January 2017, bitcoin accounted for 80% of all trading in crypto.",1,2018-03-01 20:29:59,0

TRX,Bitcoin,Anyone got a private get entered manually into Bitcoin-QT recently?,"Recently I got Bitcoin-QT up and synched with the network, yay! Then I went to the ATM and bought some bitcoin, yay! 


Then I tried several times to enter my Robocoin generated Private key into Bitcoin-QT, via this way: 

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/How_to_import_private_keys_v7%2B

I'm pretty darn sure I typed it out correctly. But I still got ""Invalid Private Key (code -5)"". :(

Has anyone else used the Robocoin ATM and entered the Private key manually this way? I'd rather not use a 3rd party service, you know? Keep it all kosher, as it were. 

What am I doing wrong? Are blockchain.info and/or multibit.org really just fine? Am I missing a step? 

I'll totally come back and mock myself if I entered the key incorrectly. 

**EDIT** Yup, I'm an idiot. Totally typed it in wrong. Nice. I've always felt like the special kid in the computer class. I kind get most stuff, but there's plenty of Trons ahead of me. I like it, it's fun, but the thickness of my skull contributes to a smaller cranium overall. Not quite a cephalic baby's Thalomide nightmare, but damn I'm dense sometimes. Ugh. Le Ugh.

 SO I PICKED ""LOW"" PRIORITY !!! for ****LOW**** network fees ON THE BITGO WEBSITE. Then I get a message on the screen that BITGO had ""auto-adjusted"" the network fees due to high network load.. I had picked ""LOW"" because I didn't care if it took 24hours to transfer....  ANYWAY THEY charged me -- 0.01117444 Bitcoin equals  6.67 US Dollar (google currency convert says )..

TRX,Bitcoin,Over $40k of CryptoCurrency Stolen,"I'm really devastated. Just looked at my wallet today when I was thinking of buying more bitcoin, all to to find out all my cryptocurrency is gone -- valued over $40,000. I spent years earning it and resisting pulling it out, hoping I could eventually use it to pay for college tuition.

Here are the facts:

- I have a Ledger Nano S wallet.

- That wallet had 4.77 LTC, 4.48 ETH, and 0.73 BTC.

- The Ledger generated a passphrase containing 24 words.

- I recorded that passphrase on a piece of paper and hid it.

- No one had or has access to that paper.

- That passphrase (those words) were NEVER entered anywhere. (Not even on my phone)

- On February 24th at 5:45 AM Eastern Time, the BTC was stolen.

- On the same day, at 6:46 AM and 6:48 AM, the ETH and LTC, respectively, were stolen.

- I also has a Trust Wallet.

- I had $1500 worth of NPXS and $1000 worth of TRX in that wallet.

- On February 24th at 6:48 AM and 6:55 AM both of those were stolen.

- The passphrase for the Trust Wallet is saved as a screenshot on my iPhone.

- My iPhone has not left my possession.

- My iPhone has a 6 digit passcode.

The recipient address for the BTC is: 3EP2Bq6yMpXQc3TvoxLtwDsd1tg2A59CJs

Note: Both wallets were hacked on the same day at around the same time. Both had separate passphrases.


No one has access to that paper and that the thief’s wallet address for BTC has other larger transactions. 

Did not have the 25th digit only 24 passphrase

Can someone please shed some light on what can be done, if anything? How were both wallets compromised at the same time?! If nothing can be done to retrieve the crytpo, what can be done to prevent this from happening in  the future.


Update:

Will reply to everyones as soon as I can. Have school work that I need to get done, and can’t let two things go bad.

For those who are asking this is the transaction link to the btc that was stolen (the majority of my holdings that was stolen):

TRX,Bitcoin,"If BTC isn't used for payments (like VISA), would it still stay secure / decentralized in the long run?","If I've understood the reward mechanism for miners correctly: as the block rewards get lower, miner rewards will be taken out of the user's transaction fees.



Since the narrative of bitcoin has shifted from a decentralized payment system to digital gold/ store of value, I cannot see anyone paying for things in BTC - the same way they don't pay for anything with Gold.



So, if fees grow from few dollars (which I think is the current state), to eventually thousands of dollars (over many decades of course), it doesn't make sense to hold even $100K worth of bitcoin when you have to spend possibly $1k in fees to just transfer it from cold storage to an exchange. Even if people move it, I imagine there's gonna be a lot of inertia and they'd move it as little as possible between CEX to wallet and would minimize any other on-chain activity. Is there a lower limit of on-chain activity that is sort of seen as a redline?





I see then that the small guy is again priced out of the system - Doesn't this go against the very spirit Bitcoin claims to have been created?



Only big money/ countries can afford the system, only the most sophisticated miners can compete in mining, while the normal person has to go to layer 2s / somewhere that is much more centralized. How is this different from the current system, if its just a different set of people who are making the rules now? Crypto elite instead of the tradition financial system elites?

Hi Jim,

Thanks I have now done so and have access to my account once again, the main issue here is that on the 5th Oct I requested the following withdrawals:

2,886 LTC & 76.24 BTC

These are show in the attached screenshot as confirmed, but still pending and with no trxID as they have not been sent, kindly let me know ASAP when they will be sent as they are now one week overdue with no explanation, no apology, nothing!

I had over $50,000 on your site, that I trusted you with, maybe one of your larger long term clients and on the 5th Oct I sold it for BTC, LTC & DASH, at a loss because I needed those funds right away, you sent the DASH but kept the main part of 2,886 LTC & 76.24 BTC then locked me out of my account and tried to ignore me, I have no idea what is going on with your exchange but I will continue with my plans Monday to seek legal representation and pursue this matter in every relevant jurisdiction regardless of the cost and inconvenience to me, unless my funds are returned to me this week.

I would appreciate a direct contact phone number with a responsible admin who is able to resolve this mess and also the address of your company's registered offices and the advocates who represent you.

Many thanks,

Hi Jim,

Due the the continuing lack of communication and progress on withdrawing my funds the advocates that I've retained have advised that I begin with documenting this fiasco on the crypto social media, as this will have a wide reach on your client base at a low cost for me compared to when they start actions proactively themselves on my behalf.

Three days since your last curt communication and still no explanation for why the withdrawal of my funds has been disabled by you and when they will be released, they show as pending on the withdrawals page, for well over one week, but no pending withdrawals are shown on the balances page, you've simply disappeared them!

I asked for the address of your registered offices, the owners/partners names and the contact details for your advocates, this is moving ever closer to a multi jurisdiction claim for fraud and theft, my advocates require a $10,000 retainer from me which is no problem, they are not cheap but are extremely effective and any fees spent on the recovery of my funds will be added to my claim of course and I am in discussions with them about how best to denounce Cryptsy for criminal investigation and prosecution, it's totally up to you if this happens but once it begins then it will not be able to be halted.

Kindly send the info requested today &/or better still my funds.

If you have not received your withdrawal, by Monday October 19, please reply to this ticket and let me know.

Hi Jim,

Why do you not even bother to reply to me anymore, do you really think that stealing 72 BTC, over $20,000 from me is something that you can just ignore?

First thing next week this goes back to the advocates that I briefed and I am paying them their requested $10,000 retainer which will also be claimed for, you have had a ton of notice but still haven't returned MY money after nearly three weeks.

I shall press the lawyers to pursue those responsible personally for civil and criminal damages, fraud and theft, in each relevant jurisdiction, kindly make sure that this is cleat to 'Vince' and the others that will end up in jail and bankrupt as a result of this.

You have until Monday to return my funds, after that the process will begin with denouncements to the police and regulators in the relevant jurisdictions and I will then have no way to prevent it all taking it's just course.

Hello email addie,

I am sorry for the inconvenience this may have caused you.
There are two separate issues going on with BTC withdrawals currently.

1: Due to the new Verifications Tier system handed to us to use, many users are frozen and flagged to become verified depending on the amounts of w/d they are making. For these, a verification agent should be contacting you soon.

2 We are experiencing some delays with BTC withdrawals and developers are working on them to get them moving again.

Looking at your account, it appears you have exceeded your withdrawal limit for your current verification tier.
Please click this link to upgrade and view the limits for your tier https://www.cryptsy.com/users/verify

*Please note that not all verification Tiers require that you upload ID or documents.

Hi Elen,

Cryptsy have introduced a withdrawal limit for my account that wasn't there when I deposited the coins, this is illegal without first offering me to withdraw the my coins under the same terms and conditions as when I deposited them.

This, so called tier three level, that it says I need now takes three months to obtain, in other words you plan to rob me of my coins for three months or how ever long you feel like, this is so illegal it is untrue.

Kindly just return MY 76 BTC, approx > $22,000 and do this right away with no more excuses, anything else is not an 'inconvenience' - it is theft pure and simple!

Regards,

Otoh

27 Oct

Hi Elen,

22 days since my withdrawal request for 76 BTC was made, October 5th, and it's still stuck, conf, but pending and all that I hear from Cryptsy is being ignored or excuses.

Cancel that withdrawal immediately today so that the coins show up again in my balance, then make me tier three verified as I have been fully verified for months if not over one year and was so when I deposited those funds and had no withdrawal limits then.

Do not continue to ignore this issue, the theft of over $22,000 from my account is a serious crime and you will be held to account for it, kindly confirm that my instructions have been carried out today.

30 Oct

Hi Elen,

Six days and you haven't bothered to let me know when I can have MY 76 BITCOINS back, now worth over $23,000 and nearly one month that you have blocked my withdrawal.

Cancel the confirmed but stuck on pending withdrawal as requested so that my coins show up in my account balance again!

Change my verification from so called tier two to tier three, I was fully verified with you and had no withdrawal limits, the longer this goes on the more it becomes certain that you just rob the larger holders of tens of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoins.

I have also requested many times, the name of the owner/s and registered office/s plus the contact details for your lawyers, it is illegal to withhold this information from your clients and the longer that this goes unresolved the greater will be the damage to your business and the more likely that you will be charged with serious theft and corruption.

Pass this email and my prior ones to Vince right away as he will be the one that will be held the most responsible for this fiasco.

Thanks,
Otoh

& when I raised the issue in Cryptsy chat now I just get banned, WTG, so corrupt, unbelievable, I shall post all my emails and your lack of useful response to Reddit and BCT forum.

Cancel my withdrawal, verify me to tier three and show MY BTC in my balance so that I can withdrawal them!

Hello email addie,

We sincerely apologize for the late response to your ticket. Upon checking, your withdrawal had been canceled and coins were returned to your balance.

Another week passed and no one has contacted me, it is now over one month since I requested withdrawal of my 76 BTC and at the time I was fully verified with no W/D limits at all, same as when I deposited the coins.

Why do you treat your customers with such blase contempt, are you really intent on alienating everyone who has supported your business and especially the larger players like myself?

My questions is that let's say that I already send the Bitcoin to the seller but the seller did not receive it yet since the transaction is still pending and online checkout process mostly only have 30 min like that for you pay. In this situation, doesn't I am the one who will lose the money and receive nothing because of the transaction is still pending and seller did not receive the Bitcoin, so he/she will not confirm that I already send out the Bitcoin even though in reality I already did.

It's absolutely necessary that everything is automated as well.

I have to make a choice, either I calculate it in satoshis or USD it can't be both since I need to have consistency for the calculations to work.

The only problem is that bitcoin can't be calculated in SATS.

Lets say I long 5BTC at 3.8k$ and sell it @ 3.9K$ = Net gain of 500$ excluding comission)

And I also buy 1M TRX for 0.000005SAT and sell @ 0.000006SAT making me 1BTC)

How would one go about keeping these 2 in the same journal?

Mind you I do a lot of daily trades and there is no chance in hell I manually calcualte the 500$ in to sats again.

Anyway it didn't take me long to realize I had started with the wrong coin. Feb 7 I lucked out and was able to sell the majority of what I had at a tiny  profit. I decided to keep about 1000 DOGE coins as a reminder to not do this again blindly. and for tipping.

I did some research and I quickly branched out into BTC, ADA, KCS,  BNB, XMR, XLM, XRP, VET, TRX, LTC  and of course that DOGE reminder. I plan on weeding these down to  BTC, ADA, BNB, XMR, LTC KCS and I am going to get some ETH before long. I am doing the DCA when I can getting my coins and also always try to wait for the dip with alerts, so I'm not glued to the charts. The bot on KuCoin is fun and I have done ok there as well.  


Not advice. Just a guy trying to make ends meet.

Ive been following crypto for 4 years now. I truly believed in its growth but I didnt want to join because of my curse.
See when I was younger I grew up in a poor country called Ukraine. I was a villain. So when I did something bad to some kid his parents hated me so much they went to a well know gypsy that practiced black magic. Apparently they paid her big money to curse me. When I found out I laughed. however starting that year ive been having extremely bad financial luck. For example I am currently on 41 game losing streak in lottery scratch cards. I bet on an african cup game on a team winning 4:0 on 75th minute to make few pennies Mali vs Angola... well Mali scored 4 goals in the last 10 years.
 Its been so bad my friend and I bought tickets for a big price draw and after few unsuccessful attempts there was the last draw left and I told my friend the only way my ticket wins is if I give it away and I was willing to bet my friend money too. Knowing my bad luck history he did not accept the bet. He just took my ticket and the last draw took place- IT WON A GRAND PRICE. MY FRIEND LAUGHED AT ME TOOK ALL WINNINGS AND DIDNT GIVE A PENNY!!  
  Well this year came and around new years I prayed to God for new years resolution for God to uncurse me and and the following week I felt like something inside me had spoken and I felt I was no longer cursed so to test this theory on January 7th I dumped all my savings into crypto, over 20 000$. I chose Trx as my alt coin and 50% of my overall investments bought it at 20 cents on the dot and spread another 50% into different alt coins. What happened next has shocked me. the very next minute the market started crashing. and only few months later i realized i bought intoat markets peak MINUTE of all peaks in cryptocurrency history!!! I have never experienced bull run yet and I have about 2500$ left of my 20 000$.

I am one of the bouz from late 2017, more precisely the beginning of November 2017.

I remember back then that I had just bought a large bag of TRX and Bitcoin for a rather small sum, and then it exploded in december 2017!

I was working as a teacher and didnt really like it, but it was alright. I have always been the kind of dude who tried many different projects in my spare time and with some succes. I managed to get some succes in Amazon FBA and had a fine sum of money i threw into Crypto.

Soon after i saw my investment fly to the moon over night and i called my babe and told her that we would be rich by the end of 2018... ooooh i should have known better! Dooooh!!!

The marked crashed and my TRX and BTC holding was worth less than i payed ...But you know what? I never sold any of my crypto... i am god damm holder, bby!

Years after i still invest in crypto and got more experience and with the realisation of that Crypto is not a ""Get rich fast"" method. It is a long time investment with alot of feelings attached to it.  
Ones in a while my babe still make jokes about my quote of being rich by the end on 2018. But i am a believer in crypto, so sooner or later we will probably get enough crypto to live our dreams.

The moral of the story, if there is one?

""Dont expect to get rich overnight, or in the near future, instead see it as a long term investment. You will experience a lot of good and bad feelings in the long run, but i am certain that in the end (in the end it doesn't even matter.. ooh not that good of a context?) we will see a positive outcome from cryptocurrency, as long as you invest your fiat in projects you find promising""

TRX,Bitcoin,Taxes on same day transaction 3 years ago?,"Wondering if anyone has run into the same problem and has any advice:

In Dec 2017, I bought some BTC and transferred it to another exchange where I converted it to TRX. This was all done on the same calendar day.

I never reported it for tax purposes because it didn't occur to me at the time that this was a taxable event, but I'm planning to do so this year as an amendment to that year's return.

I've spent hours trying to figure out if I had a gain or loss on the transaction, but since the purchase of the BTC, the transfer, and the conversion to TRX were all within a few hours of each other, I can't figure it out. The charts don't drill down to the hour.

Generally speaking, the price of BTC declined that day and was lower at the end of the day than it was at the start of the day. 

I've found general investment tax advice online that says that for traditional securities, if you can't figure out your costs for the investment, you can just estimate but that you should be prepared to explain yourself if you're audited.

I'm planning on saying that I made no gain or loss. Is this a fair strategy?

TRX,Bitcoin,Electrum Question,"I think I know how to do this but I sure don't want to screw this up. I sent BTC from an online wallet to an address I created without using Electrum. I would think that Electrum would want that public address but it appears that all that can be done is ""import a private key."" Is what I want to do then is import the private key associated with that public address?

EDIT: Two observations:
1. I feel very good about getting my BTC out of an online wallet controlled by someone else to an address solely owned by me
2. However, I can well understand how daunting a task it would be for someone who had never done this before. I don't know if it is Electrum or me being unfamiliar with the process or what. Could Electrum be improved if only in the explanations provided? For example, I find helpful explanation that address misconceptions, as in this case perhaps Electrum's help/tutorial might say, ""You might think that you need to tell Electrum the address where the coins currently are -- but Electrum can figure this address from the private key you import (and you **must** have) for the address you want to send these coins to.""

TRX,Bitcoin,"Doesn't ""bitcoin have to die, for bitcoin to live""?","I am just your average dude who watched some youtube and read some threads about how Bitcoind works. 

The following are just my ""showerthoughts"" and I am just here to ask if I am right about this. Be it in parts, or not at all. 

No need to attack me. This is just my honest understanding:

Now to me the main problem with bitcoin seems to be the insane fees and the even more insane bad impact on nature this currency has. These two kinda make it unuseable as an actual currency.

Now my understanding is that the more computepower in the network, the more expensive a single TRX ends up being, because the difficulty of bitcoin is self adjusting to ""tick once ever 10min"".

So to stop this utter madness of fees and KWh per TRX which is happening at the moment, bitcoin needs to crash, so that hopefully mining farms desolve and then later get rebuild at a way more  reasonable pace.

I know my ""theory"" sucks for everyone currently invested in bitcoin, but for the actual idea of a ""currency of the people"" to live, it kinda has to happen, right?",0,2017-12-09 14:40:27,7
TRX,Bitcoin,Can someone explain the transaction lifecycle in bitcoin?,"Hi, I'm having a bit of confusion with how transactions occur in bitcoin.

I believed that when a transaction is made, the client/node making the transaction will broadcast the transaction to ALL of it's connecting peers using an INV and in response to a getData response. 
The peers who just got the new transaction will follow the same format, sending an INV to all of its peers and only sending the actual transaction when getData is responded. 

However, I read recently about trickling. 

'Messages, in general, are flushed periodically about every
100 ms. However, transaction relaying takes place by “trickling” messages out. Bitcoin randomly selects with a probability
of 1/4 the transactions for an inv message and stalls the remaining transactions. Every neighbor gets a different set of randomly
chosen transactions, each about 1/4 of the currently available
set. Only the randomly selected “trickling node” (cf. addr
message relaying) gets all transactions immediately. The other
neighbors either get it later or already got it from another neighbor. Trickling reduces the overhead and at the same time makes
traffic analysis more difficult, in a similar manner as mixes do
in mix networks.'

I'm a bit confused now as to what really happens when a transaction is made and broadcasted to the network. Can anyone explain what really happens?",4,2018-12-18 19:45:23,2

TRX,Bitcoin,The Mempool Incident,"It is pretty obvious that the attack on the Bitcoin blockchain we just experienced was very unique.  If miners can flood the mempool with bogus trxs in an attempt to make us pay more in trx fees, than it is very important, we as a BTC society kill this practice in the egg.  

The solution to this would be to show these miners that, fees are a thing we accept to pay.  That fees are not something forced out of our pockets, this is why we adhered to Bitcoin in the first place.

I say let US, the users of BTC, flood the mempool with our regular trxs, but never pay more than 10sats/B.  This way when they are paying for trxs that are of their own doing, they can understand that they are not making any money!

In the end, it is human greed that keeps evolution from happening.  Relax of your fees people, miners are screwing us over and breaking something magical and it doesn't have to be this way.  Because in the end, we are the users, we have the possibility to dictate the outcome of fees.  We just need to hold together as one, as true society members!!",0,2017-11-17 15:29:47,4

Couldn't an ""attacker"" push millions of tiny transactions to make a DoS against the network?
I know that a single node has some sort of protection against a single ip pushing too many transactions, but an attacker could use many nodes and ""loop"" among them in order to send a high volume of transactions.

I'm not talking about spammy transactions here, let's say, 1.000.000 trx of 1 satoshi each + 5 satoshis as fee, at the current price this would just cost around 40$ ... couldn't this lead to a cheap yet effective DoS attack against the network?",7,2016-06-16 15:42:28,6

TRX,Bitcoin,BitMEX: Good Or Bad for the Bitcoin Market?,"Its pretty evident that the cat is out of the bag and a lot of crypto traders noticed what happened when BitMEX went offline for a brief period during a scheduled maintenance last night. The exchange that has traded over 1 Million Bitcoin (BTC) in a day on two occasions, has been the fan favorite for traders who are taking advantage of the bear market and want to short the digital assets of Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA), EOS, Ethereum (ETH), Tron (TRX) and XRP.

&#x200B;

***​Its also public knowledge amongst traders that # Trading over there is as fast as greased lightning.***

&#x200B;

The million dollar question?? The value of BTC is if BitMEX is a friend or enemy to the general ecosystem of Bitcoin in the crypto markets. One argument that has been postulated is that during that one hour of maintenance on BitMEX, a majority of the short positions in the global crypto markets were inactive. This then means the Bulls had a chance to go long on BTC thus triggering a buying spree and a price increment.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, one may say that shorting Bitcoin and other digital assets is simply destroying the ecosystem and even preventing the SEC from approving ETFs based on the fact that the markets are too volatile. The reason why SEC declined 8 ETF proposals is it aims to at all times prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices, in short mandates to protect investors from shady trading,

&#x200B;

​The other side may argue that Bitmex is the oldest derivatives trading platform and has offered great trading/ investment options and in return also grown exponentially, so instance Bitmex enting the most expensive offices in Hong Kong.

TRX,Bitcoin,It seems like at least some of the alts are loosening their ties to BTC,"Although this may be hope more than fact, it seems like at least some of the alts are loosening their ties to BTC, which is a good thing for both. I see more and more coins being traded directly against USD (especially on BFX) like TRX and others. That is a good thing for crypto as a whole, even though it may not be so good for BTC. That said, the price of BTC will be defined more independently and not also as the 'coin you need to buy alts' causing these predictable fluctuations that bots take advantage of.

What do you think? Will it be good for crypto as a whole to simply have the USD(T) as the reference currency? Maybe this was the idea behind Tether all along. It is a risky coin and I still don't trust the exchanges. The first broker that offers to buy and sell most bigger alts directly against fiat at reasonable exchange rates and costs will change the market. Some offer it, but it is not very interesting given the exchange rates.

TRX,Bitcoin,What crypto did for a young Latin American enthusiast.,"So, I wanted to share my experience in the crypto world and what it did for me, this ended up being longer than expected, so, sorry for the long post, also sorry if there’s grammar failures. 

There’s a TLDR at the end just in case.

----------------------------

At my 25’s was when I decided to jump on this train, although I had heard about bitcoin a while ago when it was “brand new” I did let the bad things that were said about it cloud my judgment, something that still happens nowadays. I wasn't smart enough to research about it and have my own vision of the future, even though that I consider myself a tech enthusiast, I didn't. 



I took my first steps when the mining\ETH boom, overpriced GPUs and out of stocks everywhere… With all this hubbub, I decided get know what was all this about. I started to research, reading, watching videos, learning, watching charts, and non sleeping doing all that… One of the things that I discovered was that I could get crypto by mining with my Rx-480, this was not only a gaming piece of tech, it turned out to be an investment, I got it for $190 a few months before the mining boom. I didn’t saw this mining thing as a long run thing, it was just to make enough for upgrading my old AMD FX PC to something better, ended with a Ryzen-Polaris build a few months later.
Mining with only one GPU, it took time, I did $400 a few months later, back at that time Bitcoin was $2500~$3000 dollars, only If I knew, today that would be thousands of dollars lol


In my country $400 US were $18,000 DOP, that’s half my monthly salary (Not much, but enough, for now) after reaching my goal for a new PC, I stopped mining, I wanted to preserve my GPU and enjoy it for a few years more. (which didn’t happen for long, sadly, it died at the beginning of December, I had to put back on duty my old HD5570 ([Picture inside](https://imgur.com/a/dUWdo) ) that I had lying around, I hope to return it to retirement soon, since a really nice guy from reddit offered me his old 650Ti after trying to help me with the RMA process, which is really difficult and expensive from here, almost like buying a new one... so that’s gonna be like a “after christmas” gift for me)



Back to the story... after reaching my goal, I was still fascinated by the crypto world, so many different currencies and tokens, all this technology behind it, a new form of economy that was about to hit the world, one where we all had a chance of getting something more from what we are allowed by governments and this monopoly ruled by fat greedy pigs that control everything for their own benefit.



I remember leaving some $20s distributed in BTC, ETH and LTC, the idea of investing on crypto was always on my head, even if I didn't have enough money for that, or even if that meant making some excuse to my girlfriend (now future wife) for not going out to the movies more than once in that month… And the next one too lol. 



Got to save $100 in that month and bought BTC with my money for the first time. Which became small investments in many altcoins. Didn't sleep much many nights researching, learning and watching the market for a few nights, I even got to annoy my girlfriend because I “was always talking about bitcoin” she told me many times “If you want me to listen to you talking about that, talk me when you get a car out of it, then we talk, or at least show me when it becomes real money ” lol 



After doing my “homework” my chosen altcoins where ETH, LTC, OMG, QTUM, GNT and GNOIS, sadly I didn't hold them long enough before getting all back to BTC. I managed to get another $100 to invest a month later, I was still reading and learning about almost every well mentioned altcoin. The ones that I decided to buy were XRP, IOTA, XLM, NEO, ARK, EOS, ADA and of course some ETH and LTC. Even though that I had the interest in getting a few more, like ETC, TRX, POWR, SUB, BCH, KMD, ICX and maybe a few others, money was not enough.   



Time passes, a few months, where my $200 investment became almost $700, and the other $20 are almost $150 now, for a total of something around $850, which I’m cashing out, although I’m keeping 50 doge coins that someone on reddit gave me a few weeks back, lets hope it goes to the moon one day lol… 



Putting things on perspective, those $850 are $41,000 DOP, a little more than my monthly salary.

This didn't made my a millionaire like some lucky folks out there, nor gave me a car or a house, not even close, but this money and my Christmas/Thirteenth salary is going to be a relief now that I’m almost getting married, both (me & my gf) moving out from parents, and waiting for a baby together, paying for the all the marriage fees, rings, security/tenancy rental deposit, some medical appointments for her due the pregnancy and maybe some Christmas gifts for our families, but also, this gave me knowledge. 


I did learn a lot, I did socialize with many cool people on reddit and many telegram groups, also got to know this fascinating new world with many technologies that are changing the world and bringing with it a new economy that can beat the pigs and the monopoly under their control, one where they print all the money they want and have everything for their own benefit. 
 
it's amazing what cryptocurrencies has done for so much people, changing so many lives, it didn't made me a millionaire, but others have, so many young kids that were curious enough to put some interest on something useful, so many persistent people that jumped into this long ago waiting for this to change their life or just to get some extra money because the salary wasn't enough. Crypto gave me a possibility, it gave me a little bit of freedom, it gave me a better Christmas in difficult but wonderful times ahead. 



Good luck to you all, may the profits be with you all, make good investment, be smart, read, learn and win, not only money, because learning is winning. I hope you all reach your goals and maybe something more than that, some lambos or teslas and I hope to join you all again one day not too far, before the rocket reach the moon.



Merry Christmas for you crypto fellas.  

-------------------------

TLDR. This is a story of how I started mining with 1 GPU, how it took me months to reach my first goal, still fascinated by the crypto world, I kept learning about it. months later managed to get some extra cash ($200) to invest in many altcoins and btc which made almost 400% it didn't made me a millionaire, not even close, but got some extra money to help me starting my new life (paying security/tenancy rental deposit for moving out with my future wife, fees for our civil marriage and some medical appointments due expecting a baby) I’m left with no GPU to mine, only 50 doge and the desire of coming back one day before the rocket lands on the moon... But also with a lot of knowledge about new tech and knowing that there’s a new type of economy coming, one that gives more hope and freedom, knowing that the world is about to change.

TRX,Bitcoin,Questions regarding use of Electrum Sweep function on Paper Wallet,"Hi Everyone,  just experimenting around and I used the Electrum Sweep function with a Paper Wallets Private Keys.  It worked but I have a couple questions and was hoping to get answers on.  (1) When Sweeping, Electrum did not have the option to use the camera to view the Private Address QR Code so I had to enter the keys manually.  What would be the most secure and easy way to scan the QR code.....just buy a USB QR Code Scanner??  (2) Can the Paper Wallet receive address continue to be used.  (3) When I did the sweep, Electrum had several options which were Copy, Save, Broadcast and Close.  I selected Broadcast and then Close.  What is the Broadcast option used for and did I need to do it.  (4) The transaction cost around $.41.  Does that sound right....seems a little high for one transaction. (5) Does Sweeping or any other of my actions during this process leave any vulnerabilities with my Electrum Wallet?  Thanks in advance for your time :)",6,2016-10-25 06:21:04,2

Three months later I announced the site here, and even then I was a bit hesitant because the transactions were sometimes up to 10 seconds apart. **Now the graph is non-stop with a near steady stream.** I plan on adding a trx/minute reading to measure the actual rate.

I would note that I'm **seeing new patterns.** There was typical clustering about one or two addresses, but now I've seen a lot more chaining occur, where 20+ trxs spew in seconds in one long chain. **The transactions are also smaller.** 500 and 1000BTC transactions were common place just a few months back.

Also, as potential transactions fill in the block queue on the mining software, does that increase the chance of combinations of solutions to be found?","50,000 bytes worth of trx data is reserved for 'high priority trx' stuff where a fee of .0001 or more is paid.  Otherwise, it seems that paying a fee of .00001 per KB in the remaining 700,000 bytes.

Also just learned that the transaction size limit is 546 satoshis not 5460 as I usually say - this got fixed back in 0.9.0
Each transaction is approx. 500 bytes on average.

And ALSO The reference implementation caps the number of free transactions it will relay to other nodes to (by default) 15 thousand bytes per minute. (Network limits the block to accepting roughly 30 free transactions per minute or one every two seconds.)

[For you technical Buffs](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=124302.0) = it takes about 180 Bytes per input, 35 bytes per output, and a remaining [10 bytes based on version numbers and counters](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction). 

Say you've got a faucet balance (based on half a KB per avg transaction, you need .00001 per every 3 transactions - using this information, do your best to hold off from withdrawing from a faucet as long as possible or use your BTC within services that are off chain to save money on transaction fees) 

Based on my complex calculations 750000/500 = Average of 1500 transactions per block effectively

1500/10 = 150 which divided by 60 = the 2.5 transactions per second that everyone is complaining about.  

In my opinion - this debacle of increasing and decreasing the blocksize is akin to  equipping our cash with rfid chips - we could do it, but at great potential expense.  

In other words, I'm siding allowing consensus to rule the day.  Don't worry - if a split occurs,  (1mb and greater than 1mb flavors of node software and mining software) occur then its likely that larger nodes will choose to update, but that individuals will take benefit from relaying smaller blocks.  Also there is a proposed block pruning capabilities in the core reference software to occur in the future - this paired w/ small block caps would stimulate disbursement of nodes and ultimately distribution of the network.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"BSCPad, meet Justin Sun and TRON. TRONPAD’s trading is open on PancakeSwap NOW","If you want to just jump to the bottom and go ahead and buy, I would suggest that. When it comes to public listings like this, the early birds get the worm, so just recognize the huge names behind this and know that this is not a debate, this is a race.

**Justin Sun, Founder of TRON and CEO of fucking BitTorrent** (he straight up bought it). You know, the guy who has enough money that he bid slightly less than the $69M needed to get the Beeple NFT. Who scheduled a $4.5M lunch with Warren Buffett **only to cancel on the geriatric fuck.**

This token is **listing at 120k market cap.** Take a second and let that sink in.

A guy is running this project, with the ability to send it to 100x with just the pocket change in his sofa, and the public knows it. Elon eat your heart out.

I feel extremely comfortable saying this is a project that’s going to **1000x.** $120M is easy peasy in this market considering so many token without utility and anonymous broke teams get farther than that.

As a fair IDO platform for projects launching on the increasingly popular TRON blockchain, this could end up **being the next PolkaStarter, $120M itself currently,** having previously hit a high over $500M. And this is all near-term sort of projections, the long-term with this kind of support is monstrous.

Partnering themselves with BSCPad is a massive win too as they won’t simply be flying blind into the abyss. **Being the largest BSC-based IDO platform**, BSCPad has an obvious plethora of experience to build upon. 

If you’ve learned anything from watching this token and that token flounder about these past several months on BSC, you know exactly how much a steady hand and experience can make a difference.

The equitable approach BSCPad has developed for users on this platform will be an instant draw as TRON experiences the same sort of boom that has **sent BNB from a $30 shitcoin to the 3rd largest cryptocurrency** in the world in less than half a year.

Even better, TRON isn’t run by a clown who tweets shit like “Buy the Dip.”

And with BSCPad’s western focus, and Justin Sun’s eastern influences, you can see where this may face less barriers than the aforementioned fucking nutcase.

But anyway, as good as I am at telling you about why this project is going to make you rich, you should stop reading. Immediately. **BSCPad pulled a 200x within hours on their own.**

With Justin Sun? Again sers, this is a race. May the itchiest trigger fingers win.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"EGO Expands Multi-Chain Presence: Launching $EGO Bridge to Tron, Joining Solana and Base for Enhanced Memecoin Growth","As a proud holder of $EGO, I am excited to share some significant developments that promise to elevate our community and the token's value. This Thursday, during the Weekly EGO Show, we will witness the launch of the highly anticipated $EGO bridge to the Tron network. This expansion is a major milestone for $EGO, marking its presence across multiple blockchain platforms. With substantial traction already achieved on Solana and Base, integrating with Tron further solidifies $EGO’s position in the competitive crypto space.

Why is This Integration Significant?

Tron is swiftly becoming a prominent hub for memecoins, and this is big news for us $EGO holders. The Tron network offers low transaction fees, high liquidity, and a rapidly expanding ecosystem that rivals established networks like Solana and Ethereum. Under Justin Sun’s leadership, Tron has been actively promoting memecoins such as Sundog, which have already made significant waves in the market. By bridging $EGO to Tron, we are strategically positioning ourselves to tap into this vibrant and growing market, thereby enhancing our visibility and adoption among memecoin enthusiasts.

Benefits of the $EGO-Tron Bridge:

1. Increased Exposure: Expanding to Tron allows $EGO to reach a broader audience within the memecoin community. This increased visibility can attract more investors and users, potentially driving up the token’s value and utility.

2. Enhanced Transaction Efficiency: Tron's blockchain is renowned for its low-cost transactions and fast processing times. As a result, $EGO holders will benefit from quicker and more economical trades, making our trading experience smoother and more cost-effective.

3. Cross-Chain Utility: With integrations across Solana, Base, and now Tron, $EGO is establishing itself as a versatile token with robust cross-chain functionality. This multi-chain presence ensures that $EGO remains accessible and functional across various blockchain ecosystems, increasing its utility and appeal.

What This Means for the Future of $EGO:

The introduction of the Tron bridge is expected to act as a catalyst for $EGO's continued growth and adoption. Our strong and supportive community has already shown immense backing for $EGO, and this strategic move could propel the token to new heights. By expanding our reach and enhancing our functionality, $EGO is well-positioned to drive significant value and establish itself as a leading memecoin in the market.

Join Us for the Big Reveal:

As a dedicated holder, I encourage all community members to mark their calendars for this Thursday at 6 PM UTC / 2 PM EST. This launch is a pivotal moment for $EGO, and being part of this event will allow us to witness firsthand the expansion and promising future that lies ahead for our token. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to celebrate and support the growth of $EGO.

Get ready to take $EGO to the next level. Let’s move forward together and achieve new milestones in our crypto journey!

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Tron’s Meme Madness: Is Twiskers the Next Big Thing?,"It’s been an epic week for Tron, and the meme scene is on fire. The buzz kicked off with the beta launch of SumPump, a fair launch platform giving everyone a shot at buying new meme tokens. The game plan? Scoop up all tokens in the bonding curve. Once achieved, the meme token gets delisted from SunPump and moves to SunSwap with its liquidity locked.
The Tron community is now on the lookout for the next big meme token to rival the likes of Pepecoin, Doge, Brett, Dogwifhat, and Shiba Inu. Despite Tron’s massive market cap, the ultimate meme has yet to be crowned.
Tron memes like Coconut Chicken and TronGuy are the OGs. They are great candidates to be meme leaders for Tron. They are very active and have great community support. But now, with the introduction of SunPump, a new contender has emerged called Twiskers. Twiskers is making waves with a staggering increase in just one day. What sets Twiskers apart? Minimal activity among top holders. While I’m not giving financial advice—meme coins are wild cards—it's worth keeping an eye on the top wallets. Tracking their movements might give you insights into whether they’re in for the short term or eyeing a place on the meme throne.
Drop your thoughts and let’s see where this meme madness takes us!",12,2024-08-18 03:52:30,8

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Is Tron Guy the next big Tron Meme,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share some thoughts on a new token on the Tron blockchain that’s been getting some buzz recently—Tron Guy Token. For those who may not be familiar, this token is based on the real-life character, Tron Guy, who’s been an internet legend for nearly 20 years now. His iconic Tron suit and dedication to all things Tron have made him a memorable figure in the online community.

Given the recent success of tokens like Sundog, Sun Wukong, and Bull, there’s speculation that Tron Guy Token might follow in their footsteps—or maybe even surpass them. One of the reasons is that this token isn’t just about the usual hype; it has a real person with a long-standing history and cultural significance behind it. The connection to a well-known character could give it that extra push needed to stand out in the crowded crypto space.

Plus, there’s a cool campaign happening right now called the “Find Tron Guy” campaign. If you’re going to be at Token 2049 in Singapore this September 2024, keep your eyes peeled! Tron Guy himself will be making an appearance, and there’s a lot of excitement around what this could mean for the token’s future. Simply snap a picture with him and post it to X with the hashtag #FindTronGuy and the team will send you some tokens for your efforts. It’s not every day you get to meet an internet icon who’s now stepping into the world of blockchain.

What do you all think? Could Tron Guy Token be the next big thing, or is it just another flash in the pan? Would love to hear your thoughts!

Cheers!",8,2024-08-30 14:12:55,3

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Uniting Tron Blockchain With Timeless Internet Culture: Introducing $TRNGUY memecoin,"

Hello r/CryptoMoonshots Excited to introduce $TRNGUY, a unique meme cryptocurrency that bridges the Tron blockchain ecosystem with one of the internet's timeless memes: Jay Maynard, the ""Tron Guy."" This homage celebrates the enduring appeal of early internet memes while fostering a community within the Tron ecosystem.

The Moonshot Claim:

$TRNGUY stands as a testament to the power of internet culture, encapsulating how a simple homemade costume can evolve into a lasting digital phenomenon. This token represents more than just a meme; it's a cultural artifact that unites the nostalgia of early 2000s internet fame with the modern potential of Tron’s blockchain technology.

Utility:

$TRNGUY’s primary utility lies in its ability to unite the Tron blockchain community. By holding $TRNGUY, enthusiasts are not just participating in another cryptocurrency venture; they are becoming part of a movement that celebrates creativity and the enduring impact of meme culture on the digital world.

Problem Solved:

The creation of $TRNGUY tackles the gap in representation of meme culture within the Tron blockchain space. It provides a platform for community engagement and cultural expression, linking the past and present of internet lore.

Benefits:

Community Building: $TRNGUY offers a unique way for Tron users to connect, share, and engage with the broader theme of digital culture.
Cultural Preservation: It serves as a digital reminder of how memes can transcend their original context to have lasting significance.
Drawbacks:

Market Volatility: As with any cryptocurrency, especially meme-based tokens, there is a risk of high volatility.
Niche Appeal: The specific focus on a single meme might limit broader market appeal outside of meme enthusiasts and Tron users.
We believe $TRNGUY is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s a celebration of meme culture’s place in digital history, specifically within the innovative Tron ecosystem. Join us in making history with $TRNGUY, where every transaction is a nod to digital heritage!

TronGuy is available to buy on trons Sunswap, JustMoney Swap, ChickenSwap, BabyTuru Swap & BBC Swap

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,3.67M MC NOIA isnt in your bag but ZRX TRON ONT or some other jokester of a large cap is? Why? You can fix that.,"Yes NOIA has tripled in a few weeks.  So what?!

 If I told you the price of a brand new Mercedes had tripled, wouldn't you still buy it if its price was $1000?   

Thats where NOIA is with relative value:     5M MC

NOIA increases your internet speeds by using intelligent programmable Segmented Routing and paying nodes to act as traffic cops -- relaying information about the fastest most reliable routes.. somewhere between 30% to 500% improvement  (yes, documented) depending where you are.  It's not only b2b but B2C. 

It is also protected from a Covid decline. In fact, the contrary:   With more and more video traffic chewing up bandwidth and causing bottlenecks and drops, there is ever more demand for this solution, not less. 

Consider that: 

12 NDAs with multi-billion dollar firms - and several PoC's w said firms.

Visible proof NOIA is working among giants solving Segmented Routing via IETF dot org (Cisco,LINE, Softbank, China Telecomm, Huwwei and many others)
To be clear no Pship ann with any of the above ---- yet.

Team lead by ex-Equinix co founder Bill Norton (Equinix is 5.5B Revenue company)
Token is required for all consumption - all services. 

Solution is a simple as downloading an app and installing it and the best part -- end user doesnt even need to know its crypto. Swipe a credit card and NOIA is bought in the background by NOIA inc.  ZERO crypto knowledge required for revenue by end user businesses or users.  They pay a subscription.. that's all they need to know.  It just makes their internet faster. Oh and it's a FAST VPN to boot.",25,2020-05-12 17:28:45,33

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,VIDYA: The Highest Quality NFT Gaming Coin,"Good afternoon lads.

I have returned from the depths of Uniswap yet again. I had to crawl through scamcoin and gas fee hell to make it back here alive. I will now present to you my research and write-up on the next moonshot. Take heed.

My illustrious time on this sub has been hallmarked by the creation of untold millions of dollars in cryptocurrency value. Check my profile--the last three posts here were Asko (65x), Strudel (14x), and Chow (15x). I was even gifted Reddit Silver, an achievement that triumphs all. My enormous shitcoin profits pale in comparison to the sheen of that beautiful medal. Thank you kind stranger.

The coin is VIDYA. Before reading any further, check out the website and teaser. It is probably the coolest and most well done crypto site I have seen, and the teaser is actually funny. High quality stuff.

Site: [https://team3d.io/](https://team3d.io/)

Teaser: [https://twitter.com/Team3D\_Official/status/1327748977085779976](https://twitter.com/Team3D_Official/status/1327748977085779976)

Dex:.[https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0xda3706c9a099077e6bc389d1baf918565212a54d](https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0xda3706c9a099077e6bc389d1baf918565212a54d)

For transparency’s sake, I’m in at $.060 and $.069.

Quick Tokenomics Rundown:

2.3M Mcap, volume at a healthy 350k and picking up strongly ( was only 80k yesterday), not a ton of holders. Liq locked through UniPower.

Devs are non-anon (registered business in Canada, owner is fully doxxed) there are multiple articles from various news sources on the website. Their previous works include blockchain games like TronGoo and TronFarms and the on-chain messaging platform 0x60.

First, a mesh of pasta from the VIDYA websites and articles will be presented. Then, I’ll further break down and give my opinion/outlook on this coin.

Da Pasta (skip if you want a more informal breakdown, read through if you want a bit of a deeper understanding):

VIDYA is a new project by Team3D, the development team behind Vidya Games Incorporated, a blockchain gaming startup from Toronto, Canada. The Vidya platform will include a lineup of fast-paced, turn-based and single-player games which use non-fungible token based items, utilities and cosmetics. As NFTs, these items can perform as cross-game and cross-platform methods of progression tied directly to your Ethereum wallet. Decentralized and player-driven markets, as well as a centralized shopfront, allow users to directly buy and sell NFTs to each other through their vendors, or purchase and mint new items directly from Team3D. Play-to-earn avenues for non-PvP users are not only offered, but appreciated, as they support the artistic goal of the team to produce intriguing content for all kinds of gamers. The transactional volume produced by user engagements with these products assists in funding of the Generator, a staking mechanism that incentivizes lockups with rewards in the form of Vidya tokens, which are circulated through player activity. Every Team3D product can be accessed from the website, referred to as TeamOS due to its stylistic representation of a retro desktop environment combined with a vaporwave aesthetic.

All items on the Vidya platform are non-fungible tokens, putting ownership in the hands of players and allowing them to manage items from their Ethereum wallets in a trustless and decentralized fashion. These items function as cosmetics, utility, Easter eggs, rewards exchangeable for Vidya tokens and quest items for community challenges. Each wallet has a seven-slotted paper doll for equipping applicable items, providing access to weapon and character skins, attachments and hidden content. Third-party game developers are welcome to request to mint their own item lineup, providing their own various utilities and purposes while supporting the Vidya ecosystem. They can edit and manage their own prices, descriptions and restock times. The Vidya marketplace allows users to vend their items to others, purchase items from other player vendors, or buy them directly from the team with VIDYA tokens. A percentage of all transactions in the marketplace support stakeholders for locking up their Vidya and liquidity provider tokens.

Back To Me:

Ok. So now you understand the concept.

The price action of this coin is unlike 99% of other coins on this sub. Why? Because it hasn’t pumped yet. You aren’t going to be FOMOing into a massive green candle here.

Their FPS game is set to release soon. Marketing is picking up, and hype is building. Clips of the game, player models, guns, etc. are all being teased. The game looks sick, like actual game dev good, not another bullshit boring crypto game. Think Superhot, Farcry 3 Blood Dragon, and Hotline Miami vibes. Bet on matches with NFTs. There are a ton of test clips on their Twitter.

This is not a low-tier mobile-esque game like almost every other crypto game. This is a high quality FPS that actually plays like a real game is supposed to.

Here’s one of the latest updates from the lead dev:

“Animations for the player-model are complete. We've been grinding out new maps and ideas all the while and are keen to work on rekindled social outreach, regular content and footage releases, and a brand spanking new trailer showcasing all that we've accomplished so far. The fun starts now.""

They even have a staking system as well--The Generator--as mentioned above. It uses the entirety of Team3D’s blockchain games and NFT’s to form an ecosystem for earning tokens.

Read more about it in the medium article here: [https://team3d.medium.com/the-generator-nft-staking-art-and-decentralized-finance-collide-4acc06527a1f](https://team3d.medium.com/the-generator-nft-staking-art-and-decentralized-finance-collide-4acc06527a1f)

VIDYA is substantially undervalued relative to the innovativeness and quality of their product. It fits the current NFT mania craze niche, has an extremely reputable team, an amazing game in development set to release, and some of the best optics I’ve ever seen. Marketing is building, and word is getting out. The TG channel and Discord are seeing an influx of new members. Volume is building. MCap is extremely low. TG/Discord active. Responsive admins/devs/owners. NFT mania. Not pumped yet.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Predator ($PRED) has Top 50 potential (1000x) | Just Launched on PCS | AMA’s next weekend at SSB and Satoshi Club (200K Audience) | Mega use cases 🔥 | Insane marketing 🚀 | BUSD rewards | Audited ✅ | Join the hunt !,"Predator is unlike any other crypto project you have ever been part of. That is a promise! Predator combines NBA Top Shot, Chiliz (2B MC) and Gymshark and provides amazing Tokenomics.

&#x200B;

Why the Predator team believes the project will 1000X and become a steady top 50 with a market cap of over 2.5 billion dollars ?

&#x200B;

🩸The marketing operation is spot on and as aggressive as can be. No project will have more shilling from influencers. You will see (more) articles about Predator on the best websites. We market global and local, with a focus on Tier-1 and Tier-2 countries with country specific strategies. Read more about out marketing below. 

🪓Predator is more than a crypto. Its a brand. We are launching PredFit and you will see our logo in every gym near you. Think Gymshark.

⚔️ You are not going to find a more dedicated and talented team than the Predator team out there. The team won't stop pushing until we are in the global top 50. Come say hi!

🔪 Predator will introduce the first crypto pay tv for (especially) extreme sports.

❗️ The NFT ticketing system Predator will introduce for selected sports and events will Revolutionise the way the world attends events. It will allow a wider audience to participate, as well as facilitating ownership tracking to help fight ticket scalping.

🩸Predator will launch an NFT marketplace (PredShots) where users will be able to collect NFTs representing their favourite athletes and moments from selected sports. Think NBA Top Shot.

&#x200B;

Join the hunt and become part of the Pack🐺! Litepaper here: [predatortoken.org/litepaper](https://predatortoken.org/litepaper) ❤️

&#x200B;

LAUNCHED!

&#x200B;

Predator successfully launched on PancakeSwap 6 days ago. No presale dumping (Whitelist was vetted). The contract address is 0xe59046e1a4a83c11ccc578e26da4eeec8484ed8d

&#x200B;

AGGRESSIVE MARKETING

&#x200B;

Predator is a brand. Predator is aggressive. The team wants to conquer the extreme sports industry, as well as dominate in the marketing approach. Project has plenty of funds for the most active marketing you will have experienced. The marketing and development wallet is 3% of the total supply, every transaction incurs a tax of 2% that goes directly to marketing as well, and the team pays for much of the marketing out of their own pockets. 

Predator promises you dozens of influencers a week, as well as unique offline marketing. Everybody on BSC will have heard about Predator. Nobody can escape.

&#x200B;

In the first days after the launch, dozens of influencers made promotions for Predator. Additionally, Predator has been published on several prominent crypto websites and business news websites. Check out this Medium article for a beautiful overview: [https://medium.com/@predatortoken/predators-marketing-update-16-august-2021-fd99bc3d74e7](https://medium.com/@predatortoken/predators-marketing-update-16-august-2021-fd99bc3d74e7) 

&#x200B;

AMA’S UPCOMING

Next weekend is AMA weekend❗️

Saturday 21 August 16:00 GMT Predator will be co-hosting an AMA with Satoshi Street Bets (101K members). We will be talking all things PRED, including usecases, CoinGecko and CoinMarketcap, upcoming marketing, and much more. 

Sunday 22 August 15:00 GMT an AMA with Satoshi Club. Over 90K active crypto investors will be introduced to Predator - the most promising new project on Binance Smart Chain! 

Predator also finalised a long term marketing deal with Satoshi Club. There will be major exposure to Satoshi Club's angel investors group, Predator will be listed as Satoshi Club exclusive partner (among Litecoin, Tron, Cardano, KuCoin, Monero, etc) and Predator will be published a lot on many Satoshi Club platforms (Telegram, Bitcointalk, Twitter, website, Medium, etc).

&#x200B;

FUNDS ARE SAFU?

The team understands every question regarding the safety of investment very well. The Predator team consists of crypto investors just like you that are familiar with BSC. Being sick of the rug pulls and teams running away is one of the reasons Predator was built. The team is here to stay and will do the utmost to become, in time, a top 50 crypto project. Oh and most importantly: the team can’t touch the liquidity, as it will be locked for two years as soon as launch. 

You also can check our audit from TechRate over here: [https://predatortoken.org/audit/](https://predatortoken.org/audit/)

Locked liquidity and our contract is audited.. Funds are safu! ✅

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"🍀 Ferox 🍀 Token Update; Rising Star of DeFi on Tron, Tremendous Opportunity on Private Sales","$FRX (Ferox token) is a 1 month old hidden gem from the currently hyperactive Tron Network with a state of the art crypto team we built around it.

Around 750 holders now, supply locked at 700 million, very low market cap steadily increasing, this is as early as you can catch a true #MoonShot candidate before it reaches escape velocity 🚀🚀🚀.

Seed Round sells at a great discount vs the upcoming IDO which is scheduled to launch right after expansion to Binance Smart Chain, a high probability play exists here for a minimum 12-15x which is frankly a conservative estimate comparing how well even lesser and totally anonymous IDO candidates have recently fared on BSC...

Just to be clear Tron Network has also invested a lot on launchpads recently, and there is a chance the IDO can occur on Tron too, which would lead to even faster price appreciation as FRX is a native TRC20. Bear in mind that the smart contract has initially deployed on Tron, and FRX tokens are already traded by the community on AMM's and secondary markets. 

Here is the landing page for the Seed Round, all you need is a Tron wallet that accepts TRC20 tokens to receive $FRX ( like TronLink or Trust Wallet ) 🏆: [**www.feroxadvisors.com/frx**](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx)[ ](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx)🏆

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"🍀 [FRX] 🍀 Revolutionary DeFi TRC20 Update, Surprise Hit from Tron Network, ""Be Your Own Hedge Fund""","Since our last post several days ago, interest in FRX has been steadily increasing,

A few corporate investors and VC's also got in touch with us to earmark sizable portions of the Presale supply to immediately become whales ahead of the upcoming IDO (while it must be said our priority is the independent individual investors).

And with good reason, as you can see in the full Tokenomics pie chart (at the bottom of the landing page), the total supply released during both the Presale and IDO rounds, even if both are fully subscribed, represent only 8.6% of the full token supply.

Considering over 50% of FRX supply is locked, and most of the tranches are vested for various functionalities, the circulating supply will be quite low, and a successful IDO effectively guarantees an exponential price appreciation from the get go, making the current Seed Round prices, which are already greatly discounted against the IDO price, a huge high probability play.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"🍀 [FRX] 🍀 Surprise Hit from Tron Network, ""Be Your Own Hedge Fund""","$FRX (Ferox token) is a 50 days old hidden gem from the recently invigorated Tron Network with a state of the art crypto team we built around it.

Around 800 holders now, total max. supply locked at 700 million, the very low market cap is steadily increasing, this is as early as you can catch a true #MoonShot candidate before it reaches escape velocity 🚀.

Seed Round sells at a great discount vs the upcoming IDO which is scheduled to launch right after expansion to Binance Smart Chain, a high probability play exists here for a minimum 12-15x which is frankly a conservative estimate comparing how well lesser and even totally anonymous IDO candidates have recently fared on BSC.

Just to be clear Tron Network has also started investing in launchpads recently, and there is a chance the IDO can occur on Tron too, which would lead to even faster price appreciation as FRX is a native TRC20. Give Tron Network and its stellar TRC20's a chance, it might be the best bet you make in crypto space this year...

Here is the landing page for the Seed Round, all you need is a Tron wallet that accepts TRC20 tokens to receive $FRX ( like TronLink or Trust Wallet ) 🏆: [**www.feroxadvisors.com/frx**](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx)[ ](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx)🏆

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"🍀 FRX 🍀 on Tron Blockchain, Huge Upside Potential on BSC Migration","FRX (Ferox) is the world's first DeFi hedge fund token, offering monthly dividends from the company's proprietary trading accounts through a seamless staking system coded on Tron blockchain.

It might have come across as a little too advanced for Tron's gamer / gambler audience, and undoubtedly Tron Network lost a lot of steam over the last recent months, so the first reception was lukewarm...

Now that team Ferox is facilitating a migration to BSC, price can skyrocket as soon as it's officially declared and a launchpad deal is finalized, you heard it here first.

You can pick up FRX on the Seed Round at [www.feroxadvisors.com/frx](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx).

All you need is a Tron wallet that can receive TRC20 tokens,

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"Defi on Tron with almost zero gas fees compared to ETH, and the first major audited project","So gas cost on ETH took up most of my profits, thus migrating to tron (TRX) network with fees of 0.03 USDT.

First major project i came across is by [pearl.finance](https://pearl.finance) which build [salmonswap.io](https://salmonswap.io) too. Major token is pearl of 30000 tokens following YFI. (Building vaults now) and they launch salmonswap in which is a LP yield farm, ROI 3000 to 5500% APY currently.

Bought Pearl/TRX and started LP yield farm, moon coming

Update:I now do not think tron will fly because the ecosystem is not matured yet, but i think it has potential will need more months ahead. Thinking back many of its projects has no use case. Not so good after all. Was too bullish earlier.",3,2020-09-07 01:34:39,13

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,🍀 FRX 🍀 Ferox Token Positioned to Explode with Tron's Launchpad Moves,"Tron Network finally understood the value of launchpad deals and partnered up with DuckDAO today. This positions $FRX (Ferox token) as arguably the number 1 IDO / launchpad candidate on Tron Network. Already they were in negotiations to do an IDO next month on BSC; DuckDAO will very likely snap them to strengthen its foothold on Tron.

Regardless of where the launch happens, 15-20x from these extremely cheap Seed Round prices are a conservative estimate.

Here is the landing page, all you need is a Tron wallet that accepts TRC20 tokens to receive $FRX (like TronLink or Trust Wallet): [www.feroxadvisors.com/frx](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx)

Very low MCAP currently, with only around 600 holders, this is as early as you can discover a true gem in crypto space.

📃Whitelist Applications – None!

🚀Launch: Fair (August 6th)

The rewards coin community has proven to be one of the most active and fun communities the entire crypto space this 2021 altcoin season.

Iconic meme coins with popular names have made thousands millionaires this year alone, and most of them started as a joke. We are here to show you that not every coin on the BSC is a memecoin, and that in fact, a coin with utilization like Baby Tron has huge potential.

We are committed to this project long-term, all the while helping our holders pump their bags with TRX. Baby Tron is a simple-to-understand growth and rewards token built on some of the most sophisticated technology in the entire crypto space – the Binance Smart Chain. We are aware of the amount of scams on this platform, so if you have any questions don't hesitate to jump into Telegram and ask any of our team or community members. We are here to serve you!

What if you could earn free TRX, while your BBTRX bag grows?

This is a brand-new project that launched exactly 1 month ago — and gaining traction every day, spreading mostly by word of mouth. We haven’t even taken the plastic off. Our team is tight-lipped and plans on saving most of the marketing for after launch. The old “wen marketing” meme seems fitting here.

📃 If you're looking for a presale or a whitelist, you're in the wrong spot. Security will escort you out the door.

FRX (Ferox token) is the hidden treasure you've been waiting for from the recently reinvigorated Tron protocol with a state of the art doxxed crypto team built around it.

Paradigm shifting staking model with robust utility based on fiat derivatives trading dividends gives FRX a peerless intrinsic value proposition head and shoulders above the 99% of the meme coin craze going on these days.

Around 1100 holders now, max supply locked at 700 million FRX, the low market cap is steadily increasing, this is as early as you can catch a true MoonShot candidate before it reaches escape velocity 🚀.

Seed Round sells at a great discount vs the upcoming IDO which is scheduled to launch right after expansion to Binance Smart Chain simultaneously on Tron and BSC; a high probability play exists here for a minimum 10-12x which is frankly a conservative estimate comparing how well even anonymous and totally cloned IDO candidates have recently fared on BSC...

Just to be clear Tron Network has also started investing in launchpads recently, and there is a good chance the IDO can occur on Tron too, which will lead to even faster price appreciation as $FRX is a native TRC20.

For our highly risk adverse investors who like to play a safe game, Central Exchange Listings also coming up and shortlisted for July.

Here is the landing page for the Seed Round, we listened to the community and adjusted all the bonus tiers at a fixed USD amount after the powerful TRX rally;

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"🍀 [ FRX ] Ferox Token 🍀 Rising Star of Tron Network, Tremendous Opportunity on Seed Round","**FRX (Ferox token) is a hidden gem from the currently lit Tron Network** with a celebrated public team behind it, and real use cases with robust utility (more on the white paper) .

Very low MCAP currently, with only around 600 holders, this is as early as you can discover a true gem in crypto space, only 700 million locked total supply.

Tron Network finally understood the value of launchpad deals and partnered up with DuckDAO recently.  This positions $FRX as a leading IDO / launchpad candidate on Tron Network. Already they were in negotiations to do an IDO next month on BSC; now it can happen on Tron in an even more pragmatic way. 

Regardless of where the launch happens, 15-20x from these extremely cheap Seed Round prices are a conservative estimate.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Baby Doge meet Justin Sun and TRON. TRONPAD’s trading is open on PancakeSwap NOW," 

If you want to just jump to the bottom and go ahead and buy, I would suggest that. When it comes to public listings like this, the early birds get the worm, so just recognize the huge names behind this and know that this is not a debate, this is a race.

**Justin Sun, Founder of TRON and CEO of fucking BitTorrent** (he straight up bought it). You know, the guy who has enough money that he bid slightly less than the $69M needed to get the Beeple NFT. Who scheduled a $4.5M lunch with Warren Buffett **only to cancel on the geriatric fuck.**

This token is **listing at 120k market cap.** Take a second and let that sink in.

A guy is running this project, with the ability to send it to 100x with just the pocket change in his sofa, and the public knows it. Elon eat your heart out.

I feel extremely comfortable saying this is a project that’s going to **1000x.** $120M is easy peasy in this market considering so many token without utility and anonymous broke teams get farther than that.

As a fair IDO platform for projects launching on the increasingly popular TRON blockchain, this could end up **being the next PolkaStarter, $120M itself currently,** having previously hit a high over $500M. And this is all near-term sort of projections, the long-term with this kind of support is monstrous.

Partnering themselves with Baby Doge is a massive win too as they won’t simply be flying blind into the abyss. **Being the largest BSC-based IDO platform**, BSCPad has an obvious plethora of experience to build upon.

If you’ve learned anything from watching this token and that token flounder about these past several months on BSC, you know exactly how much a steady hand and experience can make a difference.

The equitable approach BSCPad has developed for users on this platform will be an instant draw as TRON experiences the same sort of boom that has **sent BNB from a $30 shitcoin to the 3rd largest cryptocurrency** in the world in less than half a year.

Even better, TRON isn’t run by a clown who tweets shit like “Buy the Dip.”

And with BSCPad’s western focus, and Justin Sun’s eastern influences, you can see where this may face less barriers than the aforementioned fucking nutcase.

But anyway, as good as I am at telling you about why this project is going to make you rich, you should stop reading. Immediately. **BSCPad pulled a 200x within hours on their own.**

With Justin Sun? Again sers, this is a race. May the itchiest trigger fingers win

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"Bridge.Oracle will become the TRON protocol’s very first Oracle system, which will move the industry closer still to the industry’s final goal of decentralizing the Web.","For Bridge Oracle, smart contract networks need to be fed objective and accurate data, serving up opportunities for enterprises and even governments to offer Oracle verification services and hyper secure and decentralized oracle networks to regulate information. 
Bridge’s Oracle is built for the real world. It is the first ever dedicated public oracle technology on TRON network which is developed to provide the ability of accessing external data for ordinary users’ smart contracts.

There are many real-world demands that are ready to use these smart contract solutions but are not, simply because there is no Oracle solution. Smart contracts would be able to replace, among many other examples:

1) Payment upon service delivery. For example, if paying a promoter to show content to a fixed number of viewers, the contract can determine accurate data that proves the content has received the required number of legitimate views, then pay out the agreed sum to the promoter. This solves disputes in where marketers have to trust that service buyers will pay out, and service buyers have to trust marketers to deliver legitimate views.

2) Insurance claims. Using oracles to access IoT data feeds, for example, from a fire tracking system in a building, accurate data on fire and damage can be injected into a smart contract to precisely calculate and pay out compensation to the policy holder.

3) Shipping and tracking. In the age of online shopping, consumer use of shipping and tracking services has become increasingly demanding. Traditional services suffer from shortcoming such as delayed data, wrong data and missed payments. A smart contract that is fed Oracle-verified data can accurately keep track of delivery, releasing payments to merchants and deliverers.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,🤖PolkaTron - PTRON -- 💎New Gem | 💥Explosive Potential | 🔒Renounced Ownership & Locked LP,"**Summary**

Not affiliated with the project but I’m buying in because it’s this early! The token aims to show how a community can progress a token without a developer team and can all contribute towards the token’s growth. Many tokens are held back by suspicious days, but this project already has its liquidity locked and ownership renounced. The community is building. Just over 100 holders so perfect entry point! I wouldn't usually enter one of these but this one definitely has potential, the challenge I assume is all holders need to contribute towards the token, but it seems a success so far!

✅ Fair Launch

✅ 100% Community Owned

✅ 50% Tokens Burned

✅ 100% Locked Liquidity

✅ Renounce of Ownership

✅ 10% Tax – 5% Liquidity & 5% Reward to holders

&#x200B;

What makes this great is that liquidity is naturally grown as well as incentivises people to buy Tron and not just rely on the NFT which is happening a lot.

So the dev was quite smart in looking forward, the amount of Tron to hold to receive the NFTs is a very low amount, a handful at the moment. These numbers will change and adjust as the number of holders and available Tron change but for now it's an amazing Entry.

&#x200B;

About 14 hours old, Absolute microcap, listing price was $5. Currently sitting at around $10-12.

There are only 2xx holders with good distribution of course as it was stealth launched. This shit will melt faces by the end of the week, some groups have already gotten hold of it and we're just waiting for marketing to really get us started.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,TronHero new management fee sharing project,"We are excited to announce our newest project, $TronH. Also known as TronHero, this is a special DeFi project that we plan to offer to the public soon.

TronHero.io is the most popular and secure crowd funding contract running on the TRON blockchain. Our team has acquired more than 16,000,000 TRX in our previous two contracts.

Our management fee is 8% on all deposits into the contract. With our latest project, $TronH, we will redistribute this 8% to all holders. For example, if the contract brings in 100,000,000 TRX, there will be 8,000,000 TRX redistributed to the $TronH holders. Now the more you hold, the more of the fee share you will receive. For example, if you hold 10% of the circulation supply, and there is 8,000,000 TRX to be redistributed, then that investor would receive 800,000 TRX. 

TronHero $TronH Tokenomics 


Total supply: 4,000,000

Pre-sale allocations: 2,500,000 (whatever not sold will be burned)

Uniswap liquidity: 1,000,000 (will be reduced according to what is final Eth cap) 

Development/marketing: 500,000 (will be locked with vested release time every 6 months) 

Pre-sale price: $0.25

Uniswap listing price: $0.40

Marketcap at Listing of circulation supply: $1,000,000

70% of Eth raised going to locked liquidity 

30% of Eth raised going to support TRX balance of TronHero.io contracts to prevent contract drainage. 

There is no soft cap and the hard cap is 520 Ethereum.

Pre-sale is expected to start in a few days on bounce.finance platform. We will have the contract details provided at the time the sale goes live.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Virgin Vs Chad ecosystem on Tron Blockchain.,"Listen I know Tron typically will garnish some furrowed brows and many of verbal right hooks.

But I came across a project (an ecosystem of several tokens) on Tron that has an insanely low market cap.

They are actually more than the typical copy-paste ERC20 standard token that does nothing as well.

It is an experimental ecosystem which is why they used Tron. They stated on the Bitcointalk announcement they didn't want participants to use $5-$10 in gas when on Tron its about fractions of a penny.

It might just be the most interesting thing on Tron right now **PERIODT**, and is yet to be even noticed.

Go check out [https://virginvschad.site](https://virginvschad.site)

It is a gamified token experiment that has a CHAD token, and VIRG token.These are both already distributed with a market value. Check out the website to understand the interesting tokenomics behind these. They have built-in tax per transaction features that are distributed to a rewards pool that is then given back to the community every two days.

**One token redistributes taxes and distributes in a way that favors top holders and one random wallet.**

**The other token taxes** in a way that is designed to bring more security in price declines, and a few random bottom wallets. When the price is down 10% in a 48 hr period, half the rewards pool will be distributed to holders that haven't sold in that 48 hr period.

**There is a competitive nature** between these two in that every 48 hours when the rewards are distributed, one token can steal from the tokens reward pools based on which has more liquidity. It then distributes those tokens to its own holders.

VCR is the yin yang of the Virgin vs. Chad community. It is currently being COMPLETELY distributed for free to get the ecosystem rolling.  To get the free tokens you have to create an account with [https://cctip.io](https://cctip.io/) and then go to @chadvsvirgin on Twitter, and quote retweet the top tweet with #VIRGvsCHADtokens

It is an experimental rebase token that has a starting supply of **100 tokens** with a price target of **$1**. If the price is above $1 then more tokens are added to the supply and everyone's wallet in an attempt to push the price back down to $1. **Total Market Cap of $100 measly bunos** right now.

These tokens also have had pretty active transactions per day considering the liquidity is so low. Liquidity is the only problem I see... BUT.. it is only so low because the Market caps are so low!

A good portion of these small supply tokens ARE in the LP pool. But the prices of them are still so low, that liquidity dollar value numbers are low. If the prices of these tokens pumped the Liquidity would rise without Liquidity ever being added.

**CHAD 5000 supply. $0.62 = $3100 Total Market Cap**

**VIRG 20000 supply $0.07 = $1504 Market Cap**

**VCR 100 supply (REBASE TOKEN) $8.37 = $837 TOTAL MARKET CAP**

**Market Caps of all 3 tokens are sub $3500.**

**TRADEABLE ON THE TRON VERSION OF UNISWAP, JUSTSWAP**

They also have a future gameplan of being the first to add NFT farming on TRON as soon as Justin Sun inevitably adds an actual NFT TRC token.

LP farming is set to come within the week to add incentives for the community to add liquidity.",3,2020-10-12 17:31:52,2

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Oikos (OKS) Tron DeFi Gem <10M,"Hello all, welcome to my first post. I write this because I think I've found an interesting project you should check out.

**What is Oikos?**

Oikos ([https://oikos.cash](https://oikos.cash/)) is a decentralized synthetic asset platform that provides on-chain exposure to real-world currencies, commodities, stocks, and indices. These synthetic assets are collateralized by the Oikos Network Token (OKS) which when locked in the contract enables the issuance of synthetic assets (Synths). This pooled collateral model enables users to perform conversions between Synths directly with the smart contract, avoiding the need for counterparties. This mechanism solves the liquidity and slippage issues experienced by DEX’s.

**Why is interesting?**

1. The narrative it's solid. DeFi has great momentum and Tron's DeFi is gaining traction right now, e.g. [Just (JST)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/just).
2. Has a big brother. Oikos can be seen as the equivalent of [Synthetix (SNX)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/synthetix-network-token), which is now one of the top DeFi projects (#29).
3. Has a twist. Oikos is built on Tron instead of being built on Ethereum like Synthetix.

**Why is undervalued?**

* Supply: The circulating supply is 114M tokens so that at 0.078$ per token gives a market cap of 7.98M. The max supply is soft capped at roughly 300M tokens by an [inflationary supply model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4HorX00XWHfW_Fu8Ufb0weCTqU13WPIvR147i5MDbM/edit#gid=1445735519) so that the fully diluted market cap is 21M (there is high inflation at the beginning which is reduced progresively until reaching the soft cap by 2030)
* Tokenomics: When doing synth exchanges on the system, a small fee is taken and distributed among synth issuers (OKS stakers). Every week, OKS stakers are entitled to a portion of the weekly OKS staking rewards. Rewards are assigned based on the percentage of total Synth supply minted by each wallet. The stability fo the system is done via “*over-collateralization*” so that is it required to lock 7.5 times (for now) more value than the synths you mint.
* Valuation: Let's now crunch some numbers. What if Oikos become the Synthetix of Tron? Tron has a market cap of 1.8B while Ethereum has 48.5B, that's a 3.71% of Ethereum market cap. Synthetix is sitting at 800M and a 3.71% of that would be 29.69M, that's x3.72 right off the bat. However, DeFi projects are pumping, first the ones in Ethereum and recently the ones in Cosmos. Do you think is gonna be different in Tron? Well, take a look at Just (JST) which just did x10 in the last month. Tron DeFi is growing. So let me give you some opium. Imagine that Tron's DeFi grows and Oikos captures just a 10% of Synthetix market. That would put Oikos at 80M market cap, that is x10 from where it is now.
* Extra: Oikos team introduced two weeks ago [OpenTron](https://medium.com/@oikoscash/announcing-opentron-753b344e2a4c), the first fully independent implementation of the Tron protocol written in Rust, which is near completion. They want to provide a fast and lightweight Tron client which will contribute to decentralization and encourage community participation. Also, they hope to introduce modern APIs which will make Tron development easier for developers. So they are not only developing their own project but contributing to Tron itself. This make me confident about their technical skills, and I also expect them to gain recognition in the Tron's ecosystem.
* Outro: Finally, don't forget about Tron's founder Justin Sun. He is a very controversial guy, but we have to acknowledge that he is a marketing genius. He is the shiller god. What if he discovers this project, likes it, and endorse it? Well, you could imagine...

**Will VCs dump on us?**

Oikos had 4 [token sales](https://medium.com/@oikoscash/update-on-progress-token-sale-report-ce5c83e3a492):

1. Private sale: 0.83M tokens at 0.022$ (x3.54 at current price)
2. Public sale: 5.92M tokens at 0.025$ (x3.12 at current price)
3. IEO at Hoo.com: 14.75M tokens at 0.025$ (x3.12 at current price)
4. OTC sale: 21.42M tokens at 0.016$  (x4.87 at current price)

Early investors are on profit, however, do you think crypto invertors would take such high risk for anything less than a x10? I don't.

**Conclusion**

This project checks all my boxes to be one of the top performers in this DeFi craze if the team can pull it off. Besides, the project has little media coverage and it hasn't been pumped yet, so it is a great chance to be involved early. But remember, I'm just a random redditor so DYOR!

**Disclaimer**

I have bags for this project. Other low cap bags I have: DOS MTA PCX STAKE UDOO",0,2020-08-15 16:16:41,0

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"🔒 $COVAL, an entire wallet inside a NFT. Combining different blockchain tokens into a single token. An actual real-use case gem that will pump like a shitcoin. 🚀","# Circuits of Value and Emblem Vault 🔒

  
Emblem Vault is the first product of the **Circuits of Value ($COVAL)** ecosystem, it allows the wrapping of **multiple digital assets** (e.g. digital files, NFTs, crypto, games) inside a **single NFT** – enabling the creation of an **entire blockchain-agnostic wallet inside one tradeable token.**

**Some use cases of this NFT primitive include:**

Cross-chain Trading on Ethereum – This allows tokens from any blockchain to be traded for any other token using the Ethereum network.

* **Atomic Swaps on Ethereum –** Trade multiple tokens from any blockchain in one transaction (think of gas savings).
* **NFT Trading** – Trade any or multiple NFT’s for any other NFT or multiple NFT’s.
* **Portable Liquidity Pools –** Hold multiple liquidity pools inside a token (e.g. Balancer, Uniswap)
* **Tradeable Portfolios** – Trade entire portfolios in one transaction (i.e. ETF’s)
* **Create Hedged Tokens** – Combine tokens inside an Emblem Vault to create a composite token.
* **Digital Entertainment** – Video, games, and music inside an NFT (anti-piracy).
* **Tokenization** – Tokenise real-world assets for supply tracking or trading.
* **Blind Transactions** – Send tokens to a Vault and hide contents within with a password, the vault can be traded many times but transactions will be hidden on-chain unless you have a password.
* **Store Encrypted Data** – Stored Value (e.g. gift cards), software keys, coupon code.

[How to use EmblemVault](https://web.archive.org/web/20210318060431/https://web.archive.org/web/20210227214307/https://desktopcommando.medium.com/how-to-use-emblemvault-14ba241ca42a)

**What are the Tokenomics?**

**$COVAL is the utility token used for the purchase of products and services offered by the Circuits of Value ecosystem, it can be used for Emblem Vaults and future products. $FUEL is a utility token used within the Emblem Vault Platform for discounts.**

*The total supply of $COVAL is 2B and the circulating supply is around 1.2B.*

# Staking Plans

They have some interesting plans lined up for the $COVAL token, one of which I can describe here.

Imagine if you will an ERC20 token that allows you to deposit a token, and earn yield. When you spend your earned token, the equivalent of your deposited token will be burnt. You can later withdraw the remaining deposited token, keep your yield, but your balance of the earned token will be reduced by your withdrawal amount.

This system will allow staking, and yield without withdrawing your earnings, so gasless on mainnet. Shadowstaking is another term.

# Why should I care about Emblem Vault?

The entire cryptocurrency space has taken the concept of “money” from a very small set of possible currencies all controlled by centralized governments, to an infinite set of possible ways to exchange value.

The crypto space opens up endless possibilities for party-to-party exchange, almost like we have gone back in some ways to the days of bartering, where you could trade bananas for chickens and the act of building a barn for a horse (I might have been watching Little House on the Prairie recently …)

But the problem with the barter space and the problem with the crypto space are the same:

how do 2 parties quickly and efficiently negotiate how many bananas are worth a chicken, or how many hours of barn work are worth a horse, or how many chickens PLUS hours of barn work are worth a horse?

And in the crypto space, how can I give someone a “composite” token, meaning that I use some of my BTC and some of my ETH and some of my Dai and some of my Tron in a single transaction?

Currently, you CAN’T. In the crypto space, there is NO elegant way to exchange coins and/or tokens across multiple blockchains in a single transaction. Instead, one has to transfer BTC and then transfer eth and then transfer dai and then transfer Tron (and do that to 4 different addresses, and let's not even talk about fees).

What the crypto space is lacking is a simple way to combine multiple coins and/tokens and exchange them as a single “store of value”.

Enter $COVAL (Circuits of Value). Emblem Vault is a product of the Coval sandbox, born of the Coval ideals that crypto should be universal; fully exchangeable across blockchains, coins, tokens, countries, everything.

Using Emblem Vault, anyone, anywhere, can combine currencies across different blockchains into a single “store of value” and then transact that “store of value” WITHOUT EVER MOVING THE INDIVIDUAL COINS/TOKENS until they are claimed and are ready to be spent at any moment.

# The process looks like this:

**Create a vault**

**Put shit into it.** This can be any combination of BTC, ether, any ERC20 token, AND any ERC721 token.

* **Send that whole combination of stuff as a single tx to anyone you want and however many times you want.**
* When the time is right, **the current owner “claims” a vault**, receiving the private keys for all included coin/token types, thus being able to import them into ANY crypto wallet and spend them.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Fatality ($Fatality) – My Experience and Why This Community Stands Out!,"Hey everyone! I’m just a holder of $Fatality and wanted to share my story to bring some awareness to this amazing community and token.

# What is Fatality?

Some of you might not know about $Fatality. I first heard about it from a friend but initially brushed it off as just a Mortal Kombat meme coin. Turns out, $Fatality has some powerful utility beyond just being a low-supply Meme (100M).

# Discovering Fatality’s Utility

I'm primarily a HEGE holder (shoutout to Reddit for leading me to that presale), and had noticed tons of $0.01 transactions coming through on their chart. We we're all asking what it was, and when I learned from the Hege team about Fatality's ""Rank Bot"" increasing Dexscreener rankings through smart transactions, I was hooked. I realized it was the very token my friend had mentioned weeks before!

Now that I’ve been a holder for several weeks and won the recent revenue share (over 11 SOL!), I feel confident enough to tell you more about this token and its community.

# Key Features of $Fatality

* **100M Supply**: Much smaller than most other tokens.
* **Powerful Bots**: The most cost-effective bots for ranking, volume, and holder count.
* **Utility Services**: Vanity mints, smart launch pad (snipes and distributes to multiple wallets).
* **Smart Profits**: A unique profit-taking utility that sells a percentage of incoming buys to prevent massive dumps.
* **Cross-Chain Availability**: Services on Sol, Tron, and Base.
* **PumpFun Bump Bots**: A suite of tools to support price action.
* **Thriving Community**: Every day I can except multiple members in VC's, music bots, and tons of banter in the chats. Members from all over the world so all time zones are busy!

And there's much more! Honestly, their utilities are too numerous to list here, but what truly sets $Fatality apart are its revenue share and burn mechanisms.

# Revenue Share and Burn Mechanisms

* **Buyback & Burn**: 1% of all revenue streams go towards a buyback/burn, reducing the supply. Nearly 2% of the total supply has already been burned, bringing it down to \~98 million tokens.
* **Revenue Share**: 2% of revenue is divided into 12 equal parts:
   * The top 9 wallets (excluding Raydium) each get a share.
   * Wallets ranked 10-100 each have a chance to be randomly selected for 1 of the remaining 3 shares. (Roughly 1:30 for each wallet)

# Buyback + Burn History

*Total: 306.34 SOL ($4,702,773 Revenue)*

* **9/20/2024**: 25.95 SOL (2,595 SOL Revenue) - **$356,760 Revenue**
* **9/13/2024**: 23.59 SOL (2,359 SOL Revenue) - **$307,071 Revenue**
* **9/06/2024**: 22.64 SOL (2,264 SOL Revenue) - **$294,308 Revenue**
* **8/30/2024**: 29.79 SOL (2,979 SOL Revenue) - **$432,685 Revenue**
* **8/23/2024**: 30.59 SOL (3,059 SOL Revenue) - **$448,204 Revenue**
* **8/16/2024**: 32.41 SOL (3,241 SOL Revenue) - **$469,767 Revenue**
* **8/09/2024**: 23.86 SOL (2,386 SOL Revenue) - **$374,602 Revenue**
* **8/02/2024**: 30.58 SOL (3,058 SOL Revenue) - **$537,749 Revenue**
* **7/26/2024**: 26.80 SOL (2,680 SOL Revenue) - **$507,002 Revenue**
* **7/19/2024**: 24.95 SOL (2,495 SOL Revenue) - **$441,714 Revenue**
* **7/12/2024**: 16.59 SOL (1,659 SOL Revenue) - **$275,460 Revenue**
* **7/05/2024**: 8.69 SOL (869 SOL Revenue) - **$120,408 Revenue**
* **6/28/2024**: 5.69 SOL (569 SOL Revenue) - **$78,852 Revenue**
* **6/21/2024**: 4.21 SOL (421 SOL Revenue) - **$58,190 Revenue**

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,🚀 AstrOcash Token ($AstrOcash) 🚀 | De-Fi Casino with style and a 10-1000x Potential Compared To Competitors 🏆,"**What is $AstrOcash?** 🚀

$AstrOcash is the governance token of the gambling ecosystem of AstrOcash. It is a deflationary token that distributes rewards to its holders for holding $AstrOcash in our wallets. It basically is a crash game where you have to cash out before it crashes to take your profits. The game is provably fair and has a negative house edge.

**What is a NEGATIVE HOUSE EDGE?** ⚡️

A negative house edge is a feature that puts the odds in your favor by giving you a clear mausatical advantage over the house. To put in numbers, a roulette table at a regular casino will have a 5.26% house edge over you. So it’s not really 50/50 as it is portrayed. AstrOcash clearly stands out with its -1% house edge algorithm that makes it way easier for you to win.

**Why and how do we maintain a NEGATIVE HOUSE EDGE?** ⚖️

A lot of tokens are doing giveaways or airdrops for marketing and awareness. AstrOcash's significance with our negative house edge allows us to market differently than our competitors (which brings up the comparison of market caps and potential of the BSC ecosystem versus Ethereum or Tron). If you would like some ideas of what AstrOcash could become, read up on WINk/BLINK or Roobet

**For example:**

The AstrOcash Casino will win or lose occasionally. Mausatically, in the long run, it will lose more than it wins, BUT, our contract is structured to keep the token flowing back into the casino. Also, we will maintain maximum withdrawal limits per day to be able to manage the in and out token flow, meaning the bankroll won’t go bankrupt.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,No more switching around. CryptoKek provides one-stop ad-free multi-chain charting tools at a tiny $6M market cap,"*Is this it?*

If this thought didn’t dart through your mind as BTC flash crashed and the media ran with the story, you were either in a coma or should be checked for a pulse.

As we await the long foretold alt season that will rain lambos on us oh-so-early folks, there are always whispers that this is more like Game of Thrones where the prophecies are made up, the points don’t matter, and everyone wishes the ending wasn’t so rushed.

But after a wild weekend of corrections and rebounds, it looks like we’re getting right back on track meaning this is an excellent time to start snapping up emerging assets and those that proved resilient to market conditions.

**As a new multichain charting service with limit order functionality, CryptoKek will provide utility whether people are tracking a new ATH to sell the top, or are looking to keep their gains safe through stop losses.**

In spite of public perception due to the wild success of DOGE (not as much liquidity backing it as you think, don’t get caught up in market cap hype) cryptocurrency continues to gain more sophistication and, with mass adoption, will continue to season old investors and bring in new holders sparking innovation through the increased potential for gains and competition.

If you’re going to survive this topsy turvy market, you’re going to have to have the absolute best support and spend your time efficiently when exploring newer markets and blockchains where the biggest gains are. **By partnering with Rubic, a $36M market cap darling enabling projects to trade cross-chain, whether it’s Ethereum, BSC, MATIC, or TRON** (all incredible projects that will each find their own success as we move continue to progress into a multiblockchain ecosystem) you can stick to one reliable set of charting tools without wondering what trading features are or aren’t available on a new platform.

Just rely on CryptoKek and its public team that has accomplished so much already since having started development in 2020 Q3 with a full working product, governance features powering their DAO ensuring there’s no wasted overhead costs on management, and a pledge to stay **ad-free** to ensure maximum user satisfaction, which is what ultimately drives market leadership when it comes to services tailored for consumers.

With an extensive roadmap, BSC implementation currently being wrapped up and Rubic cross-swaps and limit orders coming next, there is a lot of room to run for this **absolutely tiny $6M market cap**. Compared to **DexTools, an ad-riddled and stagnant asset at $60M,** this is a potential killer especially once the aforementioned implementations come into play. From there, it could be lights out as CryptoKek becomes the leading chart-service for a more sophisticated, less shitcoin-driven, multichain world.

**So as a low-market cap service-driven token with a working product, CryptoKek has all the upside of a complete moonshot while maintaining a fantastic price floor in case speculative bubbles give way to a crash that only respects utility.** For me, with the uncertainties that face us, this is going to be one of my favorite safe harbors as we look to maximize the bull run and minimize the bear market.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"$SUNDOG_TRX - Bringing Evolution to Memecoins Space
","At first glance, meme coins might seem like a simple concept due to how these cryptocurrencies are typically joke-themed tokens whose value rises and falls depending upon how many people like the underlying memes. However, SUNDOG hopes to solve this problem by creating a meme coin that’s both hilarious and technologically efficient. 

SUNDOG\_TRX is a meme coin on the TRON blockchain. It references dog-based (corgi breed) memes, and the $SUNDOG token is the standard token used for theSUNDOG\_TRX project. The primary purpose of the $SUNDOG token is entertainment, amusement, technological, and investment benefit. Meme enthusiasts can trade it back and forth for fun, but SUNDOG\_TRX also has some potential for investors. 



SUNDOG\_TRX aims to explore the viability of the SunPump meme coin platform, part of the TRON blockchain ecosystem, that’s designed to provide a supportive system for creating and trading meme coins. Unlike many other crypto platforms, such as Ethereum, SunPump encourages high trading volumes. Even when a SUNDOG token is traveling between thousands of wallets in a single day, SunPump keeps transaction fees and processing times as low as possible.

To further enhance the trading experience, SUNDOG provides options for customizing slippage settings and button configurations. Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which it is executed. By allowing users to adjust slippage settings, SUNDOG helps them avoid unexpected losses during volatile market conditions. Additionally, users can customize their buy and sell buttons, making it easier to manage their positions according to their trading strategies.

Though $SUNDOG might seem like yet one more meme coin, it has several unique features that make it worth exploring. SUNDOG is designed to perform like SHIB or DOGE, but it's marketed directly toward TRON members. This allows SUNDOG to get all the brand recognition of other dog-themed meme coins while offering the fresh new features of SunPump. Compared to many other meme coins, SUNDOG has undergone a lot of reliable, stable growth through late August and early September 2024. Therefore, SUNDOG is an ideal investment choice for investors looking for the next trending meme coin. 

$SUNDOG is an excellent example of how a simple concept can capture the hearts and minds of countless crypto enthusiasts. This corgi-themed coin has leveraged the power of the SunPump platform to reach millions of traders. Not only is SUNDOG one of the top meme coins on SunPump, but it's also managed to outperform many other types of crypto tokens.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,PAW Swap is live and the future of cross-chain trading just got a whole lot easier!,"**PAW Swap Beta: Simplifying Cross-Chain Token Swaps**  
The highly anticipated release of the PAW Swap beta platform marks a new chapter in decentralized finance, offering a streamlined, user-friendly solution for cross-chain token swaps. Designed to improve accessibility and enhance transaction efficiency, PAW Swap allows users to connect seamlessly between different blockchain networks, making decentralized exchanges more approachable for everyone, from beginners to seasoned crypto enthusiasts.  
At its core, PAW Swap is built to eliminate many of the hurdles that users traditionally face when navigating decentralized finance (DeFi). With reduced transaction times and total interoperability between chains, this platform opens the door for users to participate in multi-network transactions with ease. Whether you're a novice or a DeFi veteran, PAW Swap delivers a simple yet powerful solution for accessing liquidity across multiple networks.

  
**Cross-Chain Token Swapping: Seamless and Efficient**  
One of the standout features of PAW Swap is its ability to facilitate cross-chain token swaps. Unlike many platforms that lock users into a specific network or require native tokens for transactions, PAW Swap lets users swap tokens across various chains using any available wallet. This flexibility ensures that users can interact with liquidity pools on different networks without needing to hold $PAW tokens, which drastically reduces the barriers to entry.  
By supporting multiple networks, PAW Swap provides access to a broader pool of liquidity, making it easier for users to find the best rates and execute their swaps efficiently. The platform’s intuitive design allows anyone, regardless of their experience level, to conduct cross-chain swaps with confidence, while advanced users will appreciate the speed and convenience it offers.

  
**Integrated Bridge-Swap-Bridge (BSB): The Future of Multi-Network Transactions**  
PAW Chain has always been at the forefront of innovation, and its unique Bridge-Swap-Bridge (BSB) feature within PAW Swap further proves this point. BSB allows users to not only swap tokens but also bridge them between different chains in a single transaction. This integrated approach simplifies what would otherwise be a complicated multi-step process. Instead of switching between different platforms or services to bridge, swap, and bridge back to a new network, users can complete the entire transaction flow within the PAW Swap ecosystem.  
The result? A more streamlined, user-friendly experience that reduces the time and effort typically associated with multi-network transactions. This innovation has the potential to revolutionize how users interact with decentralized exchanges, making cross-chain swaps more accessible and less time-consuming.

  
**PAW Swap: Fees and Transaction Times**  
PAW Swap offers users a fast and cost-efficient platform for cross-chain token swaps. One of its standout features is the minimal transaction fees, designed to make trading affordable for all users. PAW Swap leverages PAW Chain’s unique infrastructure to keep fees low while maintaining high security and efficiency.  
In terms of transaction speed, PAW Swap is optimized to handle swaps quickly, with a speed of .004 seconds, reducing the waiting time often associated with decentralized exchanges. The platform is built to deliver rapid transaction finality across multiple chains by processing 80,000 TPS, ensuring users experience seamless swaps without delays.   
With a focus on affordability and speed, PAW Swap stands out as a user-friendly option for those looking to trade tokens across different networks without being burdened by high fees or long transaction times.

  
**The Future of PAW Swap**  
The launch of PAW Swap’s beta platform is just the beginning. PAW Chain continues to push the boundaries of decentralized finance. The platform’s cross-chain functionality, ease of use, and focus on reducing transaction complexity set it apart from other decentralized exchanges, making it a valuable tool for anyone looking to navigate the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency.  
PAW Swap currently connects to eight major blockchains—Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arbitrum, Polygon, Celo, Optimism, Avalanche, and Base—offering users access to a wide range of networks for seamless cross-chain token swaps. With plans to add Solana (SOL) and TRON, the platform aims to eventually connect to all major blockchains, significantly increasing its reach and trade potential.  
This extensive connectivity gives PAW Swap users unparalleled flexibility, enabling trades across multiple ecosystems without the hassle of switching between different platforms. As PAW Swap continues to expand, it opens new possibilities for traders, making cross-chain swaps faster, more efficient, and widely available to all users.  
PAW Swap is more than just a token swap platform—it’s a gateway to a seamless and efficient DeFi experience, accessible to everyone.

# 📊 Technical Analysis Recap (Week of Sept 2nd - Sept 8th): Signs of Accumulation and Potential Reversal

Looking back at the past week, $EGO has shown resilience and several key technical patterns that suggest a potential positive movement ahead, despite broader market volatility. Here are the major takeaways from the past week:

* **Support and Resistance in Play:** Throughout the week, $EGO tested key support around **$0.0002574** multiple times, showing the market's firm grip on this price floor. Resistance at **$0.0002975** acted as a ceiling we’ve touched a few times, suggesting that **once breached**, it could set the stage for an **upward rally**.
* **SMA 20/50 Interaction:** Last week, $EGO saw the **20-period SMA** near the **50-period SMA**, a **key bullish signal** when the short-term moving average crosses above the longer-term. Though the crossover didn’t fully complete yet, the proximity of these two indicators signals strength.
* **Bollinger Bands & RSI Trends:** We’re moving towards the lower half of the **Bollinger Bands**, which indicates the market may be **underestimating** the value of **$EGO** at these levels. The RSI fell to the low **30s**, approaching oversold conditions by mid-week, signaling a potential buying opportunity as we head into the new week.
* **Room for Optimism Despite Broader Market Trends:** While many assets struggled last week due to broader ""Rektember"" volatility, $EGO held steady in key areas, signaling that we are well positioned for whenever sentiment shifts. Historically, the market tends to bottom toward the end of September, with significant upside potential heading into Uptober's seasonal bullish trend.

**Bottom Line:** Despite broader market challenges, $EGO is demonstrating **strength** at its key support levels and has positive technical signals indicating a possible turnaround. The RSI shows oversold conditions, and the SMA nearing a bullish crossover suggests we may be poised for a reversal. As we head into mid-September, $EGO is showing promising signs for both short- and long-term growth. Keep an eye on these levels as they could lead to significant upside in the weeks ahead.

**TL;DR:** As we're approaching Uptober $EGO is showing promising signs both technically and in terms of ongoing development. With solid foundations, community-driven goals, and key technical signals pointing toward a potential reversal, it’s an exciting project you definitely want to keep your tabs on! **Whats your take?** And what memecoins will *you* be on the lookout for in the coming days and weeks?

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,SOLCEX is finally on the move 31 million MC just hit new ATH,"SOLCEX is the only CEX on the Solana blockchain. Launched a few months ago, there was a lot of FUD around the project, and it didn't get much attention on Reddit. I couldn't understand why. I bought it anyway and have patiently followed the project. The website went live, and trading has been smooth. A few days ago, they started allowing staking, and that spiked price movement. This is a solid project with a 66k strong Twitter following. [(5) SolCex (@SolCex\_Exchange) / X](https://x.com/SolCex_Exchange)  The DEVS are active and constantly marketing and posting. I think it will see a lot of growth in the upcoming bull run.

[Solcex - The first Centralized Exchange launched on Solana](https://solcex.io/)

SolCex, a pioneering centralized exchange on the Solana blockchain, offers a comprehensive suite of services designed to cater to both novice and experienced traders. At its core, SolCex provides a seamless, secure, and accessible platform for trading a diverse array of digital assets. The exchange integrates TRON and has listed the token $MICHI, expanding its ecosystem and offering users a broader range of trading options.

Leveraged tokens are another feature of SolCex, allowing traders to amplify their positions. However, users must be aware of the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading. The platform also includes a launchpad for new projects, providing a gateway for innovative blockchain ventures to gain traction.

Security and user experience are paramount at SolCex. The exchange employs robust security measures to protect user assets and data, ensuring a safe trading environment. Additionally, SolCex emphasizes education, offering resources to help users navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency trading.

SolCex (SOLCEX) is not just a token but a key component of the SolCex Exchange, facilitating various functionalities within the platform. The exchange's integration with the Solana blockchain ensures high-speed transactions and low fees, enhancing the overall trading experience.

The savings feature on SolCex allows users to earn interest on their crypto holdings, adding another layer of utility to the platform. This multifaceted approach positions SolCex as a versatile and dynamic player in the cryptocurrency exchange landscape.",1,2024-11-08 00:43:55,2
TRX,CryptoMoonShots,$BLUE is the #1 dog on Sui chain with an insane upside potential!,"$BLUE is a memecoin born from a Reddit thread. It's centered around a really cute blue eyed dog. Cute pets are a strong meta in crypto (e.g., $MICHI, $BILLY), and blue represents the $SUI network.

$BLUE is currently at 7M market which means it is the biggest dog coin on Sui chain. And look at the biggest dog coins on ETH, Solana, TON or TRON. They are all at least above 200M and $BLUE will be too.

The reason I said this is that the team working on this coin already launched a Sui coin before and it became the biggest memecoin on Sui sitting at 160M now.

The Sui chain itself is an INSANELY HUGE network worth over $5 billion. And they just started pushing memes a lot with their version of pumpfun.

7M for a coin that just launched on a chain not as known as Solana is something you can not just ignore. 

And this is just the beginning. There will be partnerships, CEX listings and on-boarding of influential people in the near future that will push $BLUE to where it belongs. To hundreds of millions.

$BLUE and the whole Sui chain is something you do not want to sleep on. The upside potential here is insane because as soon as influencers start mentioning this chain and normies start getting in. $BLUE and every other early memecoin can do 20x-50x easily.

Liquidity is already starting to flow into Aptos. Those who join WOOF among the first will earn a lot of money.
Liquidity flows from one chain to another, first there was a HYIP on Solana, then Ton, then Tron, then Sui, and now it's Aptos's turn, all chains had a main meme dog, so WOOF is so much underestimated, this is the next big GEM on Aptos chain.",2,2024-10-16 12:59:06,1

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,BillionaireCoin💲 Successfully closed the PreSale 👍Professionally Audited ✅ Roadmap on time ✔️ | 📈2000+ Holders in less the 1 hour | 💥Huge 1000x potential💥 Now live on PancakeSwap🥞,"💲BILL is here!

🚀 BILLIONAIRE COIN has aggressively entered the Crypto Market with a SUCCESFULL Presale!

They easily surpassed their soft cap of 500 BNB by 3 times and had a huge participation with more than 2000 invertors!💥

The hard cap per person was kept really low (1 BNB) in order to avoid the presence of whales 🐳 and this has build up a strong community.

🥞They have listed on PancakeSwap on Saturday 29th May on 18.17 UTC and have now 2200 holders.

The community is on fire 🔥, the team is working hard to keep the promises made and the project has a huge potential!

But let’s now dig a bit into this project, shall we ⁉️

🔹 BILLIONAIRE COIN is launching its own cross-chain Launchpad and aims to guarantee maximum transparency and fairness to its users. These two values have been the hallmark of cryptocurrency and blockchain development. But so far are we really getting it in full as anticipated?! Especially with the emerge of cross-chain Launchpad platforms? We may assume it as humans but let’s be real, at least for once! The crypto world has to keep up with the latest security updates as hackers and scammers are always working on new ways to defraud clients. The challenge is even bigger on cross-chain platforms as they strive to develop new ways to counter hackers and scammers who are always lurking across the chains.

🔹 Luckily, BILLIONAIRE COIN is here to solve these problems! Its Team have been in this industry for more than 5 years and they have gone through several public sales. This has given them the opportunity to learn from other’s mistakes and have built in them the right knowledge to be able to build a better, advanced and fair Cross-Chain Launchpad. The new avant-garde whitelisting system will hold several IDOs and will give unique rewards to $BILL holders. The developers have committed to design a top-notch and scalable cross-chain Launchpad while its token continues to expand into the market by listing on new exchanges and growing his community with a regular Marketing Campaigns.

🔹 The new innovative whitelisting system, will be implemented from the beginning and will give a fair chance to everyone to get in the private and public sales. Nowadays, several crypto investors conduct their businesses via cross-chain platforms and BILLIONAIRE COIN will provide them a safe cross-chain Launchpad, thus will facilitate the launch of new projects on the major blockchains such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Tron, etc. BILLIONAIRE COIN is unique in that, unlike other competitors, BILL’s holders will have a 5% passive reward (shared between all BILL holders) through all transactions made on PancakeSwap.

🔹 BILLIONAIRE COIN will be a transparent platform for its community, which is quite hard to find on its competitors. An example is the fact that it will have and open IDO Live Whitelisting system that gives every user a more convenient and transparent experience than they could not get anywhere else. But let’s not ruin all the surprises and let’s the team share the other amazing futures they will incorporate!

🔹 While cross-chain Launchpad platforms do not put much emphasis on the fairness principle as more established or bigger investors dominate the activities of on the platforms, BILLIONAIRCOIN has taken a different approach. It has adopted whitelisting rules that will permit both smaller and bigger investors to participate in their IDOs. The rules will be comprised of controlled parameters in order to maximize everyone’s chance to be part of it, which is in line with its fairness principle. BILLIONAIRE COIN it’s building up a strong community to support its cross-chain Launchpad project. With its current developments, the team is determined to make cross-chain transactions as smooth as possible for users. It’s clear they want us to continue spreading their gospel even as we keep our ears to the ground on new developments.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,$HASBI the potential boomer?,"$HASBI on Solana - $180k market cap

Same team from $PFIRE that I called at $38K and went nearly 100x to ~4M ATH. The team are the Devs Zandor from EU and Cranny from UK, who have been in crypto since 2013 and 2017, plus 4 Telegram Community Managers who work with them since April.

$HASBI launched on August 7th, the exact day that markets took a big dump. After some rough weeks we seem to have found a floor on majors and memecoin charts are starting to look bottomed as well. $HASBI still pulled a Day-1 run to 850K ATH. I'm one of the first callers on telegram so there is still a lot of room for growth here if team delivers on their plans. 

This memecoin was made in honor the internet sensation 102 cm (3 ft 4 in) tall Hasbulla. They collected over 75 hilarious and cute Hasbi memes on their website, and the token GIF is vibing in your Phantom.

They also received approval from the real Hasbulla to operate as 'Hasbi Community Token', and sent Hasbulla 1% of the token supply. There's a detailed website and an 18 page whitepaper if you want to DYOR. With a $20,000 starting LP and $10,000 marketing budget at launch, they designed advanced Tokenomics with vesting of 5 weeks to 25 weeks (showing their long term vision) and commitement to the sustainability of the project.

It's Token2022 launched on Fluxbeam and there's a 3.9% tax fee; HASBI Donates 0.4% of all volume to 4 different children charities (with $2.550.00 Donated so far) and burns 1% of volume (2.1% of supply burned so far). 1% is cashflow used for strategic marketing. The marketing treasury is used for DexScreener Ads, Airdrops & SOL Trending. 

They did 21,500+ Airdrops so far, and are planning to do 100,000+ 💸

They also have a good KOL allocation and are starting to onboard callers. There is more on the Roadmap (page 14).

Overal this feels like a decent entry on medium to long term play led by an established team, especially at these low market cap and before more marketing starts. Yet, as always I still recommend you to DYOR before opening your position.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,How VPNs Secures Your Browsers as a Crypto and Solana Memecoin Trader,"Protecting your data from crypto scams is a top priority, especially on Solana, BSC and Tron where costs are low. Many scammers, fraudsters and hackers may attempt to access your personal data in various ways. A VPN can be a good starting point.

**Increase Your Online Security with VPNs:**

Will a VPN increase your online security? Just a bit. Here are some pointers:

1. **Secure Browsing Anywhere:** VPNs encrypt your internet connections, this means you can browse more anonymously from any location, as long as you're connected to the VPN.
2. **Trading on International Exchanges:** When using a cryptocurrency exchange, choosing VPNs with options for speed and server locations can be beneficial for international trading (this is a common setup for people trading from restricted locations). Strong encryption-based VPNs provide an additional layer of protection by preventing the identification of your source location.
3. **Choosing the Right VPN:** Conduct thorough research before selecting a VPN, for one that is safe for transactions and identity-related concerns. Reliable VPNs, such as CyberGhost, NordVPN, and ExpressVPN, are popular for maintaining security.",2,2024-08-29 17:04:16,2

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,An update on the Deployment of PAW Chain and PAW Coin.,"&#x200B;

On July 1 of this year, PAW Chain introduced its ground-breaking technology that takes crypto development to a whole new level and has launched them from a token to a coin.  Their innovative Layer 3 centric blockchain addresses many of the persistent challenges in the cryptocurrency space, such as interoperability, scalability, and fractured liquidity. The extensive team of over 80 developers, with experience from major platforms like Ethereum, Tron, and Solana, has crafted a unique blockchain infrastructure that integrates seamlessly with multiple chains, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Base, and Polygon, with plans to add  SOL and TRON shortly.  Plans also include 30 more chains connected by the end of the year.

  
One of the standout features of PAW Chain is its cross-chain compatibility. Developers can deploy their tokens on PAW Chain by simply providing a single contract address and liquidity pool that instantly connects them to all the integrated chains.  The ability to customize how their liquidity is deployed over the various connected chains ensures the control of their tokens always stays in the hands of their developers. The backend bridging process significantly simplifies the process for both developers and users, enabling broader reach and easier liquidity management.  Imagine being able to swap ETH for BNB with just one click!  This also eliminates the exposure to malicious threats that can arise during conventional bridging methods and the multiple transaction fees typically associated with it.  The days of the old bridging mechanism have now become obsolete with the introduction of PAW Chain’s integrated, one-click bridging innovation.  

  
The PAW Wallet offers a user-friendly experience with gas-free Layer 3 swaps.  This is a significant advantage, as it reduces the cost of transactions for users. MEV bot blocking includes mechanisms to block Miner Extractable Value (MEV) bots, which can manipulate transaction orders for profit. This feature helps to protect users from potentially unfavorable conditions.  Low transaction fees with the PAW Wallet will keep transaction fees minimal, making it more accessible and cost-effective for users.

  
PAW Chain boasts extremely fast transaction times, with transactions completing in as little as 0.004 milliseconds. This rapid processing speed is a significant advantage, as it allows for near-instantaneous transactions, enhancing the user experience and making the platform highly efficient for various applications, including trading, payments, and decentralized applications (dApps).

  
As the market looks forward to the next major bull run, PAW Chain's comprehensive ecosystem and strong development team make it an exciting project to watch. Its potential to attract both developers and investors, coupled with its unique technological advancements, will make it a major player in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies.  To read about all the utilities and plans that PAW Chain has, head over to pawchain.net to see a comprehensive list of features.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Rubic (RBC) is reDeFining trading and actually solving problems,"Soo..what is Rubic?

Rubic is a multichain DEX that aims to bring the best DeFi features available to crypto traders under one roof - rubic exchange

Already implemented features:

● Advanced DEX aggregator (Allowing you to choose the best prices available for your trade)

● Cross-chain swaps (Currently supporting Ethereum / BSC / Matic)

● Unique create & list your token feature (MyWish + Rubic)

● REAL Limit orders for RBC/ETH (To automatically fill your buy/sell order at your chosen price)

Upcoming features

● Anonymizer for all chains (Advanced privacy in trading, will work similarly to TRON)

● L2 Gas fee solutions (more below)

● REAL Limit orders for all pairs

Partners:

● Dash

● Polygon (Matic)

What else is going on?

● Multiple new team members hired for marketing & UI development

●Team accepting UI mockup submissions, $1000 reward for successful applicant to make sure to not forget anything thats needed for the perfect UX

● Contracts signed with marketing agencies in China/US

● Multiple CEX listings confirmed in AMA, listings to follow marketing push

● BRBC coming next week

Where to trade RBC:

rubic exchange / uniswap / probit / bilaxy

The team has some very ambitious goals set for the year ahead, but they continue to not only consistently deliver on their roadmap, but also expand their team to work on community suggested features as one of the most open and transparent, communicative teams in DeFi.

With a fraction of the market cap of their competitors/peers, Rubic is still a highly undervalued project with enormous room for growth.

So there are a lot of fields rubic is acting as a first-mover. But I want to highlight one point: Rubic will solve one of the biggest problems of crypto, the gas fee problem, once the L2 solution like Hermez (mainnet this Feb) is utilized:

""Jordi Baylina (tech lead of Hermez) said Hermez will help process 2,000 transactions per second at ""one-tenth"" of current fees. Ethereum's current capacity is about 15 transactions per second, and thecurrent average feeis about $11 per transaction.""

So what it means is that not only the gas for transactions will get about 10 times cheaper but also the throughput of transacting will increase to 2000 / 15 = 133 times faster when you use [rubic.exchange](http://rubic.exchange/). In other words instead of an ordinary road with 1 lane and pay booth every kilometer you will get a super highway with 133 lanes and a pay booth every 10 kilometers.

If Rubic implements it successfully, and there is no doubt about that, it will be huge FOR PEOPLE, and bad for front running and sniping bots!

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,The ability to send tens of thousands of dollars for just fractions of a penny is yet another reason why everyone should hop into crypto.,"Traditional finance is well known for substantial costs for moving money around even if the slightest amount of money is being move - especially if it is for an international transaction.

One might also consider that many of these companies are not available 24/7 and usually will not work on weekends and holidays. Crypto solves that easily as we have seen on multiple services from E-money to BSC to Tron. And these are actually available 24/7 as long as you have an internet connection.

And when you look at the cost of these services, it is mere pennies for even tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of transfers compared to bank transfers.

To be fair banks started integrating crypto in some sort with things like crypto compatible credit cards from Binance, CoinOvy and CoinBase. They even offer crypto cash back instead of fiat cash back which is much more valuable overtime cause fiat cash back does not even offset inflation.

By the way it is looking, I think if we keep up this pace, we will see mainstream adoption sooner than we really ever imagined we would.",18,2022-10-11 21:16:04,29

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Syscoin (SYS): L1 modular blockchain that brings answers to Trilemma," 2022 has been a challenging year in crypto, marked by a predominantly bloody market but also by a series of events that undermined it’s credibility to the larger audience, all of this despite high hopes appearing at the end of 2021 regarding the NFT industry.

Bear market is a natural part of every cycle, crypto or not, and the most experienced players out there saw this period coming, to no surprise, but events like the Terra Luna collapse or the FTX fraud did not help. Also, influencers overselling various projects with no real added value had a negative impact on medium to long term investor confidence in the cryptoverse. The truth is that several aspects of crypto still need to be addressed:

* Dex vs Cex: decentralization still needs to remain in focus as one of the core principles of crypto; one thing though, true decentralization is all about the code, not about the people. A study performed in July by chainalysis.com showed that across several major DAOs, less than 1% of all holders have 90% of the voting power. So, if just a fraction of the top 1% of holders coordinated, they could theoretically outvote the remaining 99% on any decision, bringing into the spotlight the question about authenticity of the whole decentralization concept.
* ·Scalability: At the moment, Ethereum seems to be the gold standard of smart contracts capabilities, but it also has faced several challenges the network being bloated, thus losing market share to other blockchains more scalable and cheaper, like BSC, Tron, Avalanche or Solana. They have announced an important (series of) upgrade(s) for 2023, nut other solutions are announced to be released sooner and to be more efficient.
* · Security: Bitcoin is and will most likely remain the reference when addressing crypto security. It’s Proof of Work has passed the test of time and networks that rely on PoW have been the least vulnerable to cyber-attacks. On the other hand, the Proof of Stake calability makes it more suitable for powering an asset as a medium of exchange, giving it the potential to provide a superior economic model for users and investors, but it makes it more vulnerable (one of the probable causes Solana encountered in 2022)

So who has the right answers to all of these questions, apparently, all the big players in crypto having only pieces of what is supposed to be one giant puzzle?

What if I told you there is a project that has been working hard to find the solutions to the above-mentioned challenges and it’s on the final straight to implementing them? It might not be the most known blockchain in crypto, but they are around since 2014, have survived several bear markets and are now in pole position to benefit from the fruits of the labor they have been undertaking for the last years.

Always adapting to the evolution of technology and the latest trends and discoveries, lead by a man (Jagdeep Sidhu) whose paper on blockchain idealism has set new architectural standards (link below) in this particular area of expertise, Syscoin has managed to go live on testnet with several of the trilemma answers.

[Blockchain Idealisms. Abstract | by Jag Sidhu | Medium](https://jsidhu.medium.com/blockchain-idealisms-b61c5781ddc3)

Several upgrades are on private or public testnet, the most awaited-upon being the release of Rollux, the leading-edge of scaling technology for solidity-based EVM smart contracts. Rollux will be Syscoin’s scalability solution, Layer 2, which initially consist of optimistic rollups followed by Zero Knowledge ones. Both will be enhanced by Proof of Data Availability (PoDA). A recent video demonstrating how these features will work has been released, revealing the ease and rapidity with which the Syscoin network will be able to process requests:

[Demo: Syscoin Optimistic Rollup + Native L1 Data Availability (PoDA) + Pali Wallet 2.0! - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mjfei_l9mpI)

A more in-depth explanation of the mind-blowing tech behind the process can be found below:

[Revealing the Method in the Madness (syscoin.org)](https://syscoin.org/news/revealing-the-method-in-the-madness)

All these breakthroughs resulted in Syscoin’s constant ecosystem growth. Consisting of numerous projects, from NFT markets, to Oracles, from dApp’s to Cex’s, Syscoin has known a constant adoption throughout the year, culminating with WEconomy’s joining the party. Weconomy, the largest Web3 incubator in Asia, currently consists of seventy startup projects and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) from across Asia, including China, Taiwan, and Vietnam.

Its mission is to have 100 projects within its incubator and ready to deploy on time with the launch of Syscoin’s Rollux, in Q1 2023.

And this is only the beginning, as we were stating before, as per Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper, decentralization, total transparency and security need to be the cornerstone of any crypto project. The adoption of these principles will finally allow Dex’s to finally take the place Cex’s currently have.

Furthermore, Syscoin is bringing opt-in regulatory compliance on the EVM chain, in addition to the already existing one on the UTXO chain, which means that no matter the jurisdiction and the regulatory framework, Syscoin has the capability to adapt.

And since Syscoin remains an open source public blockchain, anyone can build upon it and take advantage of it’s revolutionary architecture and technology.

Me Messenger & Crypto Wallet is the app, which is based on Telegram messenger integration with non-custodial crypto wallet, in which users can not only securely store their assets, but also send crypto right in Telegram chats, as well as by crypto addresses and QR-code. iMe is available on [App  Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ime-messenger/id1450480822) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iMe.android&hl)

&#x200B;

iMe Wallet supports various blockchains: Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Fantom, TON and is constantly adding new networks. Looking forward to adding Tron and Bitcoin soon.

&#x200B;

For the past 2 years, iMe has integrated various services such as Uniswap, PancakeSwap, 1inch, Symbiosis and also created its own DeFi platform for staking programs.

&#x200B;

One of the most interesting collaborations is Binance Pay integration, due to which iMe users can link their Binance account to Telegram. This is the unique feature which is powered by Binance API, when you can send invoices for payment right in chats and pay for it via Binance Pay without leaving the messenger, as well as the ability to swap cryptocurrencies via Binance platform in iMe wallet.

&#x200B;

Today, iMe has announced the new Twitter killer-integration in iMe which will bring social media and cryptocurrencies even closer:

\- Linking Twitter account to Telegram account;

\- View the feed of tweets in chats with linked Twitter;

\- Cryptocurrency transfers by Twitter username.

&#x200B;

There is a confidence that the community will appreciate this synergy, because now social networks and crypto industry really go together side by side.

&#x200B;

Elon, we hope that you will participate in this!

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Binance chain moonshots: yield farming up to 190B APY,"This is a complete guide of yield farming on BSC, which has gone up to 190B APY for certain pairs, and several candidate tokens: CAKE, BSCX, FUEL, CROW, etc.

tl;dr: buy a basket of CAKE/BSCX/FUEL and compound at [jetfuel.finance](https://jetfuel.finance) or beefy or auto. You don't even need to look at it everyday.

**Why Binance smart chain?**

Transaction fee on binance smart chain (BSC) is typically $0.2, compared to $20+ on ETH chain. This gives the ideal environment for compounding interest. Imagine you receive 1% daily, so you total gain would be 365% for the year. If you compound at 1% daily, that will be 1.01\^365-1 = 3778%. Occasionally you have something yield 5% daily, then you see a compounding APY in billions, because they compound each minute or a few minutes.

Even if you don't want to gamble on risky coins, BUSD is the stablecoin backed by Binance, and has an APY of 70%+ at some farms.

Many yield farming projects have found BSC chain offers insane APY, and are popping up all other the place. Some key players in this environment will benefit.

**Moving money to BSC**

Binance Panama is the site to transfer ETH/USDC/etc. between ETC/TRON/BSC etc. It adds a new feature that allows you to convert some transfer amount to BNB, the gas on the BSC chain, so you can convert the wrapped ETH to BNB.

[https://www.binance.org/en/bridge](https://www.binance.org/en/bridge)

**CAKE**

Cake is the equivalent of Uniswap on the BSC chain. It offers a farming section to distribute tokens to incentive deposits, and a lottery section to burn tokens. CAKE price has tripled over the last week, probably due to this trend of moving to BSC.

**BSCX**

BSCX is the 1inch on the BSC chain. It offers an aggregator for swap AMMs, a farming section and a launchpad section. The recent proposal capped the BSCX at 10 million, giving it a market cap of $38M.

Just like 1inch, BSCX offers the best swap rate for any token pairs. Since transaction fee is so low, swap through BSCX yields the best result. They are running a trading competition and you can go create your own referral link. I am too lazy to link mine.

[https://swapx.bscex.org/#/](https://swapx.bscex.org/#/)

BSCX will also push out DEX. 

**Farms**

There are several key farms that you can find at yieldwatch, the zerion equivalent of the ETH chain. [https://yieldwatch.net/](https://yieldwatch.net/)

Beefy finance is probably the largest one for now, followed by autofarm, [jetfuel.finance](https://jetfuel.finance), [thugs.fi](https://thugs.fi), etc. Bdollar is the equivalent of DSD/BAS on the BSC chain. All of those farms give a small amount of their own tokens to enhance yield.

Taking a safe pair for example: CAKE-WBNB

* Pancake offers this at 209% APY without compounding
* Beefy (BIFI) compounds it at 400% APY
* Autofarm (AUTOv2) gives some auto tokens, and therefore APY is 715% APY
* [Jetfuel.finance](https://Jetfuel.finance) offers 3440% APY, because the Fuel token they give is now appreciating

[Crowfinance.net](https://Crowfinance.net) is a new farm that just started and is without compounding. However, its deflationary token design is very interesting. If they add compounding function, it will be a very successful project. Max token supply is 20K. MC is 300K. They have an audit from vidar, and a timelock on contract.

**Candidates**

Because of the FUEL token price appreciation, I am farming on [jetfuel.finance](https://jetfuel.finance):

* FUEL-BNB token from streetswap, 90K APY
* BSCX-BUSD token from BSCX, 400M APY. This is a display error, since only 1% out of 4% can be compounded. BSCX compounding will end when reaching 10M tokens, so only two days left
* CAKE-BNB from pancakeswap, 3440% APY, to be safe

there is no lock period. You can deposit/withdraw any time. I recall there is a 0.5% withdraw fee.

I am also farming CROW-BNB pair on [crowfinance.net](https://crowfinance.net), which is considerably riskier but more awarding.

**Afterword**

Why am I writing this?

I am an adamant supporter of GFARM2 project on ETH chain. If you like this post on BSC, you should look at GFARM2 on ETH chain too.",23,2021-02-02 21:49:35,49
TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Interest Protocol | Free Stablecoin Interest Rate Loans | Use LP tokens as collateral | Whitelist open | Community call date announced !,"# Interest Protocol - BORROW A STABLECOIN FOR FREE

Some projects allow you to use any token as collateral. Interest Protocol allows you to:

* Borrow a stablecoin for free (0% interest rate)
* Use LP tokens as collateral
* Swap tokens with low slippage
* Use automated investment strategies

Interest Protocol is a project that we all should keep our eyes on. They have just released their new landing page where you can find their testnet DApp. [https://www.interestprotocol.com/](https://www.interestprotocol.com/) 

TG: [https://t.me/interestprotocol](https://t.me/interestprotocol)

***Dinero (stablecoin)***

In case the users of LP tokens decide to borrow Dinero,, their loan will have a zero interest-rate cost, which makes their loan a net positive loan. If you borrow $1000 you pay no interest-rate while your collateral will be farmed. BIG WIN to all.

Example: users can use their LP tokens such as USDC-ETH as collateral to borrow Dinero then swap Dinero for other tokens.

**If you are liquidity provider for a DEX......**

Liquidity providers suffer from a huge problem, which is the lack of liquidity that they have to buy other assets with their LP Tokens. In other words they cannot use their LP tokens as medium of exchange. To solve that problem Interest Protocol will allow liquidity providers to use their LP tokens as collateral to borrow their stablecoin, Dinero.

**DEX**

The project will also launch their own DEX that will benefit from the liquidity provided by liquidity providers, which will allow their DEX to have low slippage cost. Basically 0% interest rate loans using LP tokens as collateral will attract many liquidity providers.

**Automated investment strategies**

They also will have a vault that will make automated investments for your tokens. For example, if you deposit you ETH there it will find the best ways to invest your asset for you without having you to worry about anything.

**Community call**

They are doing this Saturday, their first community call at 9PM GMT+1 which will be the first time that the team will get in contact with their community.

&#x200B;

# Important questions about DINERO: 

&#x200B;

**Q1: “Quick question on the tokenomics for dinero. how will users be protected from runs on the coin (similar to luna)?”**

Luna scenario happened because UST was an algo stable coin. Do Kwon realized this issue and started buying BTC to make it over-collateralized.

>Our DNR stable coin is always over-collateralized by various assets.

Dinero is minted when the loan is created using a collateral asset and burned when the loan is repaid, and the collateral is returned to the borrower. If Dinero loses its peg, there is an arbitrage opportunity.

**Q2: “And since the stable coin is isolated in the lending markets, what’s the benefit of DNR over a centralized solution?”**

It depends on what you are calling a centralized solution. If by centralized, you mean coins like USDT and USDC. The main differences are that assets cannot be frozen, and the proof of reserves are on-chain.

If by centralized, you mean from an architecture design of having a mono pool instead of many pools. It makes it easier to customize which market can mint DNR and how much.

**Q3: “And where is the money coming from when earning high lending rates when the borrowing rates on the other side are relatively low?”**

>*We are actually thinking of charging no borrow rate on Dinero Markets as those rates are artificial as there is no counterparty on Dinero markets.*

When a user deposits, let’s say Cake or Sushi on a Dinero Market. The contract will deposit the underlying (Cake/Sushi) on their respective pools (Cake would be the Cake Masterchef, and Sushi would be on the xSushi vault). Since the contract has the custody of these assets, it can use it as collateral to “mint/create/lend” Dinero to the depositor.

The depositor just has to return the amount of Dinero he was given initially to redeem his underlying (Cake/Sushi) + the rewards. This scheme also applies to any yield-generated tokens such as cEth, vETH, stETH etc….

We might charge a fee for the rewards. TBD

**Q4: “If there’s any documentation regarding the full tokenomics of the coin I’d love to take a look. curious to see how tail risks will be managed”**

Tail risks would not be tied to tokenomics.

**Token 1 Interest Token:**

The Interest Governance token cannot be used as collateral in Dinero Markets. This token is minted for people who provide liquidity in our DEX to specific pairs. The benefit is to vote over proposals and over time burn them with protocol fees.

**Token 2 Dinero:**

This token can only be minted by the markets, which use an over-collateralized scheme similar to DAI. So far, the over-collateralized model has proven to be robust since DAI has survived thus far, and new coins like Tron USDD are using it as well.

Secondly, the Dinero Markets will have safeguards on how much Dinero can be minted, conservative Loan to value ratios, and only highly liquid coins will be listed. E.g., If the Cake Market has 20m Liquidity in a DEX. This specific market will only be able to create around 4m Dinero.

We are planning to start with highly liquid assets such as BNB/ETH/BTC/ BTC-ETH LP / BTC-BNB LP / USDC-ETH / BUSD-BNB. iBTC, vBTC, vETH.

The following assets will be carefully assessed before being listed.

&#x200B;

Me Messenger & Crypto Wallet is the app, which is based on Telegram messenger integration with non-custodial crypto wallet, in which users can not only securely store their assets, but also send crypto right in Telegram chats, as well as by crypto addresses and QR-code. iMe is available on [App  Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ime-messenger/id1450480822) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iMe.android&hl)

&#x200B;

iMe Wallet supports various blockchains: Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Fantom, TON and is constantly adding new networks. Looking forward to adding Tron and Bitcoin soon.

&#x200B;

For the past 2 years, iMe has integrated various services such as Uniswap, PancakeSwap, 1inch, Symbiosis and also created its own DeFi platform for staking programs.

&#x200B;

One of the most interesting collaborations is Binance Pay integration, due to which iMe users can link their Binance account to Telegram. This is the unique feature which is powered by Binance API, when you can send invoices for payment right in chats and pay for it via Binance Pay without leaving the messenger, as well as the ability to swap cryptocurrencies via Binance platform in iMe wallet.

&#x200B;

Today, iMe has announced the new Twitter killer-integration in iMe which will bring social media and cryptocurrencies even closer:

\- Linking Twitter account to Telegram account;

\- View the feed of tweets in chats with linked Twitter;

\- Cryptocurrency transfers by Twitter username.

&#x200B;

There is a confidence that the community will appreciate this synergy, because now social networks and crypto industry really go together side by side.

&#x200B;

Elon, we hope that you will participate in this!

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,WARNING PLEASE SAVE YOUR SEEDS DEAR EVEN YOU DONT HOLD ANY COIN IN THAT WALLET," 

Hi there,

I am writing this to just remind everyone to make sure to keep seeds in your wallet dear to you even if you don't hold any coin in that wallet.

I LEARNED A HARD WAY !!!

So back in 2018 there was an initiative by EIDOO wallet to drop 100 Lend tokens to anyone who downloaded their wallet. I did the first part right downloaded their wallet claimed my 100 wallets. but however, during the bear market made me complacent. As I didn't hodl any fund bought with my own hard-earned money. I somehow didn't care much about seriously taking the seed phrase. As i didn't saw myself Eidoo wallet as I was very much at ease with other wallets.

FAST FORWARD 2020.

Ethlend went on a tear in development. Further in between 2020 it went on with a swap of 100 to 1 Aave.

Rest is as is said is history. Aave went on to be the token even billionaires like Mark Cuban vying to have their hands on.

No regret though. I am just posting this to instill cautions to all who are fomoing into the cryptocurrencies ecosystem without taking the intricacies seriously.

I have made peace with my loss. Brush my Shoulder and Bought my Bag of Aave Going forward.",71,2021-02-06 21:48:18,30

Instead of presale or IEO, tokens will be distributed on a farming basis. 18 pools will open for the week from February 19 to February 26, and you can farm 2 tokens of the future platform at once! And most importantly, you can withdraw your tokens back and not lose anything. As for security, the audit is not conducted by a large company, this is a minus. But I began to study their auditor and there was an experienced white hacker with trust from Google, Microsoft, Apple. He does not hide his face, is actively Twitter and Medium.

&#x200B;

The same goes for the team. CEO does not hide himself, conducts interviews with YouTube crypto bloggers. Now the team has 8 people. An active community has already formed around the project in Telegram, Twitter.

&#x200B;

I will definitely participate in farming and follow the project. Maybe I'll try to win NFT from them in the Evangelist program. What can you say about the project?

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,What is ShipChain’s Product? Who uses it? How will Token Holders be rewarded?,"**(Product):**

**Public DPos Platform:**

At the core of ShipChain are the smart contracts. These make up an open platform that anyone can interact with that include:

**SHIPToken**, a utility token contract for powering and incentivizing transactions on our network, and eventually will be used as ""gas"" for our sidechain.

***What is the purpose of the SHIP utility token?***

*🔗 The SHIP token powers and secures a public dPoS blockchain based on the SDK developed by Loom, a layer 2 solution. It is enterprise-ready, fast enough to cope with a high supply-chain related throughput and inter-operates with Ethereum, Binance Chain and Tron.*

*🔗 In other words? SHIP is to the Shipchain Network what ETH is to the Ethereum network.*

***Why do the Shipchain dApps need a sidechain?***

*🔗 Ethereum in its current state (1.0) got clogged by a fairly reasonable peak of interest in CryptoKitties. Let alone concerns from the industry on sensitive data storage and privacy, the prospect of tracking on Ethereum hundreds of thousands of shipments with a live GPS localisation every 5 mn for each of them isn’t quite encouraging…*

*🔗 This is where the Shipchain Network and the SHIP token comes into play: to address scalability without compromising on decentralization and take into account enterprise requirements. Call it Layer 2 or independent blockchain with built-in interoperability (sounds great doesn’t it?), that’s what the SHIP token is all about.*

**LOAD** is a registry of ongoing shipments. It describes each shipment's lifecycle as a state machine, identifies trusted parties, and links to an external Data Vault full of extended details about the shipment.

**ESCROW** is a set of primitives that can attach to a LOAD for assisting with escrow payment; it accepts payment and automatically releases them to the carrier upon verified delivery.

**PEOPLE** is a directory of user-profiles, for anyone who wants to establish a reputation and trust. It allows one user to associate the same profile with many different wallets and addresses. Still under private development.

**RATING** provides reviews of prior jobs and can be used to generate a score of a PERSON's general trust level. Still under private development.

**MARKET** is a registry for posting about available work and helping connect service providers with customers in an open marketplace. Still under private development.

**ShipChain Inc Services:**

**ShipChain Web**, the first functional interface for interacting with a Transmission server to view device and tracking data. It will eventually include TMS tools to plan trips, match vendors with customers, **and handle billing and payments (in both fiat and cryptocurrency).**

**ShipChain Profiles**: An authentication and management portal for sharing access to documents and shipment data, without exposing private keys or storage credentials. Profiles also assists with managing device hardware in large fleets.

**The ShipChain App**: An Android application that uses your ShipChain Profile to provide the full experience of ShipChain Web, and acts as a basic track-and-trace Lite Client for drivers who want to try basic GPS tracking on ShipChain without committing to a hardware unit.

**(CUSTOMERS):**

Shipchain Inc. already announced a few customers: Scanlog, Casestack, Keeptruckin… The first 2 are Third Party Logistics providers, who provide transportation, warehousing, and more services to their customers while Keeptruckin is a software company who developed the leading fleet management platform for the trucking industry in the USA. One would use the Shipchain dApp within their own fleet, the other would give access to the dApp to a much larger audience (1 millon active drivers use Keeptruckin’s apps and devices).

**(REWARDs and POTENTIAL VALUE):**

**Staking/Delegating Rewards:**

Shipchain network is based on dPoS consensus, SHIP belongs to the #DEFI movement and can generate a passive income to its holders. The mainnet is live and staking rewards are already being awarded every 30 minutes.

**Network use:**

The intrinsic value of a utility token like $SHIP is to be USED. The SHIP token is to the Shipchain network what ETH is to the Ethereum network. You need SHIP to buy the gas needed to run transactions on the network. Active users tracking shipments means more transactions (it is worth noting the exponential impact of periodic GPS locations recording on the sidechain) driving more demand for the Shipchain token. Shipchain Inc. with its Last-Mile Delivery Platform and mobile app is one of these users and already committed to allocate company reserves to network security and to buy its own SHIPs to acquire network gas.

**Scarcity:**

The more token holders delegate their tokens to the shipchain dPoS smart contract, the more scarce becomes the asset. As a live experiment, Loom has demonstrated that a high level of staking up to 50% of the circulating supply was possible. Furthermore, it is expected that professional stakers will join the shipchain network to run validator nodes and these ones have most likely not acquired their 250k bonds yet.

**Speculation:**

ShipChain is still pretty much under the radar. Following 2 years of alts bear market, when most of the hard coding occurred, most crypto enthusiasts have fallen to the despair that all alts are scam, specifically the micro caps which do not bring the same reassurance to speculators than top 50 coins' supporting crowds would do. It is likely though that, if blockchain starts to deliver its promises and lands in 2020 first tangible use cases aside from 'getting rich schemes', this market will turn favorable again to utility tokens that can demonstrate a real use-case and robust token economics. At that time it will be up to the community of SHIP token holders to make itself visible to the world.",16,2020-08-12 15:24:32,39
TRX,CryptoMoonShots,💎TorrentSwap💎 - BitTorrent Chain's first full-featured AMM DEX. Their Presale ends soon.,"The first ever DEX is launching on BTTC.

You who know I'm always looking for that next one.  I think I've found it, here's a breakdown I did, make your own decision.

&#x200B;

Here's what I learned yesterday:

* Launch Date: December 19, 2021
* BTTC's first DEX is launching.  First DEX on a chain always gets the biggest from what I've seen.
* Symbol: TOR (for Torrent)
* Limited to 20,000 TOR for the presale
* Team was helpful and answered my technical questions in their telegram (pancake tokenomics).  They aren't just cheering rah-rah, seemed relatable and responsive.
* Vesting

&#x200B;

HURDLES

There was one part of the process that could have been easier, though it's not the fault of the TorrentSwap team.  It's just difficult to get bridged over to the chain.  You have to start on TRON and buy a little TRX for gas, then buy your BTT tokens (needed for gas on BTTC).  Then you have to put in your wallet settings in (most likely) Metamask

&#x200B;

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"MaticLaunchpad - Launchpad for Crypto Projects on Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum and Polygon Network.","Matic launchpad will provide decentralized projects with a platform to raise and exchange capital. Providing investors with an opportunity to participate in a secure and compliant environment with Guaranteed Allocations and First Come First Serve (FCFS) Pools.

  
Multi Blockchain Network supporting Launchpad for Crypto projects to be launched on Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Avax, KCC and Tron.

Taking a Sneak Peak at the Top Performing Launchpad as an example for Success in the Crypto Launchpads sector.

**IDO Pool Distribution**  
Project tokens offered on Matic Launchpad IDOs will be split into the following pools:  


* 10% for public white list lotteries (open to anyone who completes tasks, no tokens required)
* 10% for lottery Tier (Bronze)
* 80% for guaranteed allocation Tiers (higher tiers)

**Sale Process – FCFS Round**  
  
To participate in the Seed Sales, Private Sales and IDO’s on Matic launchpad you will have to Stake your MATICPAD tokens. Higher Tier gives you higher allocation during the sales. MATICPAD stakes will be given the first opportunity to participate.  
  
In case there are any Unsold Tokens after the first 10 minutes of the start of the sale, the Pool is opened to the full community to participate on a FCFS basis. (This has to be bold).  
  
WE WILL COLLECT DATA AND FEEDBACK ON THE IDO STRUCTURE TO OPTIMIZE THE SYSTEM OVER TIME, AS WELL AS TAKE COMMUNITY FEEDBACK AND POTENTIAL DAO PROPOSALS INTO CONSIDERATION.  
  
Our system is a predictable and provably fair system that provides appropriate incentives for our users to gather and hold tokens and support each and every project launched. To keep the system effective, we'll alter weights, create new levels, and change other characteristics as needed over time.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,T2X - Next level staking,"So what is T2X? It's a staking token on the Tron chain. It's similar to HEX but it's definitely more lucrative than HEX and not so scammy.

Here are some details about it:

* Started 13 days ago
* You basically swap TRX for T2X and then stake T2X
* By staking T2X you receive more T2X and also TRX dividends each day!
* 95% of all TRX that was collected while swapping to T2X will return as dividends to users that stake T2X
* There is no exchange or coin aggregator yet that lists T2X. It's fresh and new!
* Their own DEX is coming soon
* Every stake will get a bonus day every 5 days that it has been active. So if you stake for 10 days, you receive rewards for 12 days
* At the first day 5 million T2X were distributed. This is going down slowly until it hits 1 million. Currently it's at 4.868 million.
* Depending on number of users that enter the T2X auction daily, you receive T2X tokens end of the day

Here is an example how it works: If 2 million TRX are collected today because users want to swap it to T2X, each user that entered the auction will receive 2.43 T2X per TRX (because daily limit of T2X is currently 4.86 million). Simultaneously the users that already stake T2X will receive their share of the 2 million TRX as dividends according to the size if their stake of T2X.

You can reinvest the TRX dividends you receive and swap for more T2X or just be happy with the TRX you receive daily in your own wallet :-)

That's a brief summary. The Staking Portal has all the info you need to understand the details. The system is really simple but has complex implications. Different staking strategies are possible.

Basic workflow is:

1. Install TronLink Chrome extension
2. Visit Staking Portal
3. Enter the auction and send TRX to receive T2X end of the day
4. After you received it, stake it for the time you want
5. Next day, collect dividends and decide what to do with your acquired T2X and TRX

Video Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moz_9BNfoi0  

**The staking portal link has my Reflink. That will earn you 5% more T2X tokens at stake end and an extra 10% T2X for me. So you definitely want to use a Reflink! If you invite 5 friends yourself you get 50% more T2X tokens!**",4,2020-07-24 14:28:11,31

1. Partnership with Geleximco a huge business conglomerate in Vietnam, likely creating markets/defi apps for their $3 billion worth of assets 

2. Pool x lock and earn on Kucoin 

3. Mainnet due to be released in Q4 this year - with mainet, interoperability with both ETH, Neo, Link and Tron plus whoever else wants to become interoperable ie everyone

4. Staking and nodes as DPOS goes live 

5. LG CNS partnership begins work on Smart Cities, pilot city already selected 

6. Multiple other partnerships yet to be announced both from cryptosphere and enterprise (there are clues in the Pitchdeck document on the website) 

7. On ramp for 110m mobile phone users to directly purchase KAI with their phone credit via the countries largest Network provider",28,2020-07-27 09:53:41,24

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Wolves of Wall Street $WOWS - launch official partnership with NFY.finance and MIMIR Solutions the Doge Satellite partners.,"Have you all been sleeping on $WOWS the low cap NFT DeFi gem ( currently at a crazy low $1.9 million MC ) 
They have just launched an official partnership with NFY.finance (a Chico Crypto favourite) and MIMIR Solutions, the guys who last week announced they are one of the software partners of Geometrics Space Corporation, the 2022 SpaceX Doge satellite launchers. 

TLDR - the article that is posted on Coingape DEFI news and on the WOWS TG says they are cementing a more formal partnership and sharing development assets and skills, as well as creating shared pools and cross-platform features of their DeFI offerings. It’s also clearly based on a shared goal and mutual project focus on use cases of wrapping NFTs and SFTs in the DeFi sector. Cyotee himself is now present within the WOWS telegram and making himself known!

This is a really hard working non-anon gem that has all the DOGES in the form of the BOIS C-Folio and that has flown under the radar much like NFY did for 5 months! and that exploded to an easy 40mill MC. They have a more advanced SFT/NFT C-Folio solution ( soon to be launched ) which they will I assume share knowledge with NFY - ( they call they SFT wallets Cryptofolios or C-Folios ) 

**The immediate use-cases are:**


* Gas saving mechanism on Yearn investment called Power of the Pack
* Stack multiple staked pairs and YEARN investment NFTs into C-FOLIOS to earn boosted rewards 
* Upgrade your C-folio profit using upgrade NFTs or buy higher levels.
* Sell the C-Folios with Investment NFTS and rewards all inside! 
Or sell all NFTs separately for others to use. 
* Create Collateralised Rewards Obligations for lending collateral 
All investment LP and lending can be insured with Cover ( they are partners ) 
* Once V.3 launches ad they port Liquidity, Imagine multiple risk ratio NFTs in one C-Folio and sold as one NFT. 

**Future roadmap targets**

* Port over to Polygon Matic 
* They’re discussing BSC token for the gamification side of their project
* B2B investment platform for institutional investors 

**Upcoming news:**

* Launch farming and yield d;app utlising C-Folios
* Global Defi Summit in Dubai non-anon team presenting WOWS. 
* Other speakers include founder of Tron and AAVE

With a MC of 1.9million its a firesale with of course the market dip, I personally see massive upside-only moving forward, if they can get some more memes and social marketing it would be good but with massive marketing moves like above they deserve everyone’s attention and their investment - As always - DYOR Frens!

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"VETH not getting attention it deserves, here is why","This one isn't getting the attention it deserves because some want it under the radar to accumulate, will explain why.  

You make money in crypto by coming first and not buying tops and others bags. For once, take part in a just released, tiny cap project with no bag holders waiting to dump.  

VETHER is a limited and fairly distributed parallel of ETHEREUM, designed to be a store of value where everyone has an equal chance of acquiring VETH tokens by burning ETH or trading. 

There is a fixed supply of 1M tokens that will take 10 years to release through a daily fixed emission schedule. In the current ERA of 244 days 2048 VETH tokens are emitted daily and auctioned by burning ETH or any ERC20 tokens. After 244 days a new ERA starts reducing daily emission by half (1024 tokens) and this process repeats for 14 ERAs in a 10 years spawn and only by then full supply is out. 

VETH proposition of strict scarcity with low fixed supply and emission makes it a great shot at store of value by burning and transferring ETH value to VETH while also contributing to reduce ETH inflation. 

We don't see many mentions around yet because everyone is trying to accumulate it in the lows as its low emission nature makes it a bit hard to accumulate without driving the price up but as you can see in the stats an average of 20 ETH is being burned daily in exchange for VETH - https://vetherasset.org/stats - This will change in some weeks as the emission is reduce by half that's when people will start to shill this, after they accumulated.   

Currently ERA 1 , DAY 17 ,  32k VETH tokens emitted - 968k tokens still to be emitted  

Making an insanely tiny market cap of 70k. See the potential and how earlier it is?    

No ICO. No premine. No BS team %s. Ready to fly.

NOTE: There is also some good ARB opportunities between the uniswap price and the end of the day closing price of the token burn.

You can get VETH tokens for the current value on  https://v1.uniswap.exchange/swap?outputCurrency=0x31Bb711de2e457066c6281f231fb473FC5c2afd3

💎⚠ FAIRLAUNCH 1/09/2021⚠💎

WHITEPAPER OUT ON OUR WEBSITE

10% of ⚠CLASSIC COIN98⚠ is re-distributed to the holders with COIN98!

COIN 98 is a Multi-Chain Wallet & DeFi Gateway that is certainly making waves at the moment.

Our first objective as holders of COIN 98 from day 1 is to generate profits, taking advantage of the well-deserved hype of the main currency by redistributing a part of it to the holders so as to increase the volume of COIN 98 as well.

Trading takes place on PANCAKESWAP 🥞 and for each transaction this happens:

🏅 8% Transaction Fee to Buyback $Coin98
💰 7% Development Fee
💰 1% Liquidity Pool
💰 4% Extra Fee on Sell 


We suffered the birth of a myriad of Pancakes, Ripple, Cardano Rewards Token , most of which turned out to be scams. So we decided to create a legitimate Reward Coin, that would reward holders with the coin we think will be the game changer of 2022. Coin 98 (multi-chain liquidity aggregator that supports assets across a variety of blockchains, including but not limited to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Tron). WE WILL ALL USE THAT SOON OR LATER.

We want to partnership with COIN98 to give more rewards! hold CC98 to get free money ❤️

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"🍀 FRX 🍀 Ferox Token, the World's first DeFi Hedge Fund, Getting In Very Early","Unlike many other quick buck schemes discussed here, this hidden gem from Tron Network is actually a longer term play for the intellectual investor.

Sophisticated hedge fund offering innovative derivatives and crypto trading strategies launched on Tron to relatively obscure reception, only 600 holders so far... The very first Seed Round is going on, only 600 holders, so this is about as early as you can discover a promising new venture before it goes hyperbolic.

Staking and dividends haven't begun yet, they did a short bounty campaign which led to some investments but also lots of dumping of the token in the secondary market, so now is indubitably the most opportune moment to get in. And here is the real punchline, they are about to close a launchpad deal on BSC, probably happening around 3 weeks from now scheduled alongside their BSC migration.

If the launchpad IDO executes successfully, price can gap up at least 15-20x from here. 

Here is the landing page, all you need is a Tron wallet that accepts TRC20 tokens to receive $FRX: [www.feroxadvisors.com/frx](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx)

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"🍀 FRX 🍀 Token Launch Update; Rising Star of DeFi, Phenomenal Opportunity on Seed Round","🍀 FRX (Ferox token) 🍀 is a hidden gem from the currently hyperactive Tron Network with the state of the art crypto team we built around it, and real use cases with robust intrinsic utility (see the [**White Paper**](http://ferox.ml/wp/FRX%20White%20Paper%201.4.pdf) for more details on the philosophy of ""Be Your Own Hedge Fund"").

​Having launched our 1st Seed Round funding in February 2021, FRX to date has now accumulated approximately 650 holders (and steadily increasing), so this is still as early as you can discover a true moonshot candidate in crypto space; total supply is locked at a max of 700 million.

​Tron Network finally understood the value of launchpad deals and partnered up with DuckDAO recently. This positions $FRX as a leading IDO / launchpad candidate on Tron Network. Already we were in negotiations to do an IDO next month on BSC; now it can also happen on Tron in an even smoother way.

**​**Regardless of where the IDO (Initial DEX Offering) happens, FRX price exploding 15-20x from our extremely discounted Seed Round prices are a conservative estimate.

​Here is the landing page for the Presale, all you need is a Tron wallet that accepts TRC20 tokens to receive $FRX ( like TronLink or Trust Wallet ) 🏆: [**www.feroxadvisors.com/frx**](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx)[ ](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx)[🏆](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx)

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,LGCY hits ATH as last of the pre-staking starts - up 10x since i posted here and climbs higher steadily every week,"I have posted a thread here about [3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/j87yet/lgcy_network_56_apr_staking_for_early_holders_is/), price was at 0,00012-13. These guys are building fast and have been overdelivering from the start, which has resulted in price hitting ATH amidst all the dumpage today. 

Besides giving me great ROI, today the last round of pre-staking kicks off where you can lock your LGCY and get USDL in return, which is LGCY gas/stablecoin. 

* [About last LGCY prestaking](https://lgcynetwork.medium.com/lgcy-biki-exchange-lock-staking-d8e8ecef37f1)
* [About USDL](https://lgcynetwork.medium.com/revolutionizing-stable-coins-introducing-usdl-formerly-lfuel-b9bc86eb688a)

Staking has shown to fill up pretty fast. If this one fills again, it means 70-80% of the circulating supply will be locked in staking. Think it dumps on release? No, it didn't when the Gold pool was released, it jumped 30%. Reason for that is:

* Payout in USDL, which will have people buy more LGCY with the LGCY/USDL pair
* Snapshot of price happens when the pool expires, meaning people can pump their own staking rewards

The last round of staking is done through Biki Exchange, a daughter company of **HUOBI.** Biki's CEO, Ethan NG, is the former marketing lead of Huobi and now a [strategic advisor / partner to LGCY Network](https://lgcynetwork.medium.com/a-strategic-partnership-for-growth-570668404866).

This is a pumping machine. I am pretty confident, once this staking round is filled, we will probably see LGCY on Huobi. Imagine what will happen then. 

Anon, are you missing out on another quick 10x? 1c LGCY before the Q1 is over. Ill come back again to gloat once we hit it

WHITEPAPER OUT ON OUR WEBSITE

10% of ⚠CLASSIC COIN98⚠ is re-distributed to the holders with COIN98!

COIN 98 is a Multi-Chain Wallet & DeFi Gateway that is certainly making waves at the moment.

Our first objective as holders of COIN 98 from day 0 is to generate profits, taking advantage of the well-deserved hype of the main currency by redistributing a part of it to the holders so as to increase the volume of COIN 98 as well.

Trading takes place on PANCAKESWAP 🥞 and for each transaction this happens:

8% is used to distribute COIN98 to every holders / 💎

5% marketing wallet / ™

2% is added to liquidity! 💧

We suffered the birth of a myriad of Pancakes, Ripple, Cardano Rewards Token , most of which turned out to be scams. So we decided to create a legitimate Reward Coin, that would reward holders with the coin we think will be the game changer of 2022. Coin 98 (multi-chain liquidity aggregator that supports assets across a variety of blockchains, including but not limited to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Tron). WE WILL ALL USE THAT SOON OR LATER.

- fork from Tron, goal is to be a DPOS blockchain where staking earns you rewards in USDL, Legacy stable coin.

- $12m market cap, 1303 holders, current price is $0.0011 per token.

- staking opportunity (48%apy) starts in a couple days, last one before mainnet launches in Q3/4 2021

- majority (~70%) of tokens ALREADY LOCKED UP in other staking options for another ~90 days

- maximum supply listed is 100b, BUT there has already been some token burns and there will be more.

- 33 billion tokens to be locked in permanent staking, reducing total effective supply to 21 billion (80% less than Tron).

- very active community, non anonymous devs are very involved in the chat and provide support and guidance

Can be bought in Biki (no kyc, where final staking will happen), uniswap, and bilaxy.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,🍼 🐶 Welcome to Baby Jeju 🐶 🍼 ✨. Presale coming this week! Dev has successfully launched tokens to 20m+ MC. This will be no different. Come to the telegram and see for yourself!,"✨ 🍼 🐶  Welcome  to  Baby  Jeju  🐶 🍼 ✨

With all the new hype reward tokens it was only a matter of time before Jeju presented to you the first and best project of it's kind. Tired of rugs? Faulty codes? Rewards that don't work? Rewards that you don't want? Well here's the solution! 

We are the first project that will allow you to choose which dividends you want.

The way this works is simple but elegant, On every Transaction there is a Tax , that tax coverts to a pool which then rewards the holders in the selected dividends. 

This means instead of receiving tokens in reflections you will be able to receive from a selection of multiple dividend pools.

So far we have the following selection for the public to choose from at any time.

🔸 CAKE - Pancake Swap Token
      LINK - Chainlink
🔸 XRP  - Ripple
      BUSD - Binance USD
🔸 ADA - Cardano
      ETH - Ethereum
🔸 BTC - Bitcoin
     BAKE - Bakery Swap Token
🔸 TRX - Tron
      XTZ - Tezos
🔸 BNB - Binance Token
      Doge - Doge Token

The original jejudoge hit a Mc of 5million so can definitely be your next moonshot. The Dev has successfully created a variety of tokens and reached 20mc on a few of them.  With Btc hitting 40k we are in the next phase of the crypto bull run and jeju launch will be through the moon. 

An incoming bull market, based dev with amazing track record, a successful team, a an amazing community already behind it, perfect tokenomics, catchy name, proper whitepaper and road map, safe and guaranteed to be a mooner



We are the first token to implement this idea and we are super excited to bring this concept to Binance Smart Chain!

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"🍀 FRX 🍀 Explosive Potential on BSC Migration, Very Low MCap, only 576 Holders","This surprise gem from Tron Network has been well hidden as Tron lost some steam over the recent months and fell out of top 20...

They have been quietly developing world's first DeFi Hedge Fund token, where holders get private ownership of a stellar asset management firm, getting monthly dividends and also making daily bets at favorable pay rates of up / down price movement of various commodities on their website when using $FRX instead of any other currency. So not just a meme coin but has very robust use cases. Team is real and well known in the asset management game.

700 million max FRX token supply ever, very modest valuation compared to how much profits the hedge fund has been generating since 2017, official statements available to private investors.

Here is the real punchline, they are about to close a launchpad deal which will guarantee a fast migration to BSC to facilitate the IDO (2-3 weeks tops), it wouldn't be a surprise if the price makes a minimum of 15-20x from these somewhat obscure levels.

Do your own research, reach your own conclusions please; I present just the empirical data.

You can pick up FRX (Ferox token) on the Seed Round at [www.feroxadvisors.com/frx](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx).

All you need is a Tron wallet that can receive TRC20 tokens,

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Why you should buy and hodl low supply fixed cap coin Like Vertcoin ($VTC),">Long post with some Vertcoin shill

**Fifty thousand two hundred and fifteen US dollars ($50,215**), that's how much **1 Bitcoin** costs as I am writing this post. With the same amount of money, you can get about 119,106 **Dogecoins**.

Now, if you ask a person who knows nothing about crypto, would you rather own one Bitcoin or 119,106 Dogecoins? I bet the person would choose Dogecoin over Bitcoin. That's because our mind is trained into thinking bigger numbers are always better.

Due to the recent popularity of crypto and meme coins like Doge, there has been an influx of new people buying cryptocurrency for the first time. Most of these people don't have any idea about crypto, investing, or market cap. All they see is the price of one Bitcoin and immediately think maybe Dogecoin (or any other coins/tokens you can get a lot of like Safemoon, Shiba, etc. ) can be worth the same as Bitcoin one day so they buy Doge instead.

This kind of flawed thinking (coupled with constant market manipulation buy a billionaire) is causing the price of coins with enormous supply to pump like we haven't seen before. All of this will end one day, and it's going to be ugly. A lot of capital has to be invested into these coins to keep them constantly pumping, and there is only so much money available to go around.

# Instead, you should invest your money into coins or tokens with a low supply and fixed cap.

What do I mean by that?

When a coin has a fixed supply cap, there can only be that many coins in circulation ever, and If the supply is low, only a limited number of people can get their hands on it. Coins with low max supply are rarer, and rarity brings value.

Let us look at some numbers. I will use my favorite coin (**Vertcoin**) as an example.

    Circulating supply: 60 million
    Total supply      : 84 million

This means currently, only 60 million people can technically own a Vertcoin. It is approximated that about 5-10% of the total coins have been lost and will never enter circulation.

    Actual supply = Circulating supply - lost supply
                  = 60 million - 5% of 60 million
                  = 57 million

If we remove the lost supply from the circulating supply, we get the actual supply, and it comes out to be 57 million. It might sound like a lot but remember; there are 7 billion people globally.

    What percentage of the current global population can own a Vertcoin?
    Percentage = (57 million / 7 billion ) * 100 
               = 0.8143 %

**Wow, what?**

# Only 0.8143% of the current global population can own one whole Vertcoin

But in reality, that percentage is even lower. There are holders like me who will hold their coins with diamond hands and some who will hold a percentage and trade the rest of it. This significantly reduces the number of coins you can buy. More coins people buy and hold rarer it gets.

Since the total supply is limited and low, the number of holders required is significantly lower than a high supply coin.

# What should be the total market cap of Vertcoin if all the coins I hold are worth 1 million in total?

It's hard to calculate exactly, but the chart below should help you make an educated guess. (I am assuming all 84 million coins have been mined.)

|Number of holders|If everyone holds  => current price|Price per coin (USD)|Total market cap (USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|84 million|1 Coin=> $1.25|1 million|84 trillion|
|1 million|84 Coins=> $105|11,905|1 trillion (Bitcoin's current market cap)|
|840,000|100 Coins => $125|10,000|840 billion (Close to Facebook's current market cap)|
|84,000|1,000 Coins => $1,250|1,000|84 billion (Close to Binance coin's current market cap)|
|8,400|10,00 Coins => $12,500|100|8.4 billion (Close to Tron's current market cap)|
|840|100,000 Coins => $125,000|10|840 million (Close to Verg's current market cap)|
|84|1 million Coins =>   $1.25 million|1|84 million (Close to current Vertcoin's market cap)|

According to [this](https://chainz.cryptoid.info/vtc/#!rich) block explorer, there are already 181,745 wallets with at least some amount of coins. For all of those wallets to be worth at least a million dollars, the total market cap of Vertcoin needs to be about 182 billion dollars assuming they all hold the same amount of coins (330).

Let's see what the chart above looks like for Dogecoin.

|Number of holders|If everyone holds => current price|Price per coin (USD)|Total market cap (USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|130 billion|1 => $0.433|1 million|**130** quadrillion|
|1.3 billion|10 => $4.33|100,000|**13 q**uadrillion|
|130 million|100 => $43.33|10,000|1.3 quadrillion|
|13 million|1,000 => $433|1,000|130 trillion|
|1 million|13,00 => $5,629|77|10 trillion|
|130,000|100,000 => $43,300|10|1.3 trillion|
|13,000|1 million => $433,000|1|130 billion|
|1,300|10 million => $4,330,000|0.1|13 billion|
|130|100 million =>     $43.3 million|0.01|1.3 billion|

I can't even imagine what the numbers would look like for a coin with trillions of supply.

# TL;DR

* Buy and hold low cap fixed supply coins. These coins are rare, and only less than 1% of the total global population can own one whole coin.
* As time goes by and demand increases, these coins will be even rarer and more valuable.
* Even a small amount of lost coins can tremendously increase the value of the remaining coins.
* Low market cap coins have a higher chance of parabolic rise since the trading volume needed to raise the price is significantly lower.
* These coins do not need a lot of holders as compared to coins with a huge supply.

Final remarks:

* F\*\*k Elon Musk, I had to change some numbers above multiple times because one tweet from him crashed the market.
* Vertcoin and Dogecoins are just examples. What I said above applies to all other good projects with low supply and fixed cap.
* I made an educated guess with some of the numbers above, and I might be way off.
* I had to add Vertcoin on the title because the automated mod was deleting my posts without it.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,🔥⚠Classic Coin98 - Coin 98 Rewards🔥⚠ Fair-launch date: 31/08/2021💎," 

💎⚠ FAIRLAUNCH 31/08/2021⚠💎

WHITEPAPER OUT ON OUR WEBSITE

10% of ⚠CLASSIC COIN98⚠ is re-distributed to the holders with COIN98!

COIN 98 is a Multi-Chain Wallet & DeFi Gateway that is certainly making waves at the moment.

Our first objective as holders of COIN 98 from day 0 is to generate profits, taking advantage of the well-deserved hype of the main currency by redistributing a part of it to the holders so as to increase the volume of COIN 98 as well.

Trading takes place on PANCAKESWAP 🥞 and for each transaction this happens:

8% is used to distribute COIN98 to every holders / 💎

5% marketing wallet / ™

2% is added to liquidity! 💧

We suffered the birth of a myriad of Pancakes, Ripple, Cardano Rewards Token , most of which turned out to be scams. So we decided to create a legitimate Reward Coin, that would reward holders with the coin we think will be the game changer of 2022. Coin 98 (multi-chain liquidity aggregator that supports assets across a variety of blockchains, including but not limited to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Tron). WE WILL ALL USE THAT SOON OR LATER.

We want to partnership with COIN98 to give more rewards! hold CC98 to get free money ❤️

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,MTRG - Meter Governance token for Meter Stablecoin,"The Meter Network launched its Governance token IEO in lottery style on Gate.io at $0.5.

USD Tether, no 3 in global marketshare, owns a huge 90% of all stable coins totalling 10 billion in marketcap! Like every other stablecoin out there, it is vastly centralized and the cause for much worry and doubt (esp between warring governments and institutions).

Dai, a decentralized alternative on the other hand, eats into a multimilliondollar share, but its PoS nature is also a huge cause for worry.

Now the Meter team, a distinguished team of high laurels, created the Meter token (MTR) which is a unique Proof of Work blockchain where every Meter metered out (pun intended ;) is worth & pegged to 10KW of power ensuring the stablecoin has a consistent value of $1.

The Meter (MTR) blockchain is a stablecoin asset faster than Bitcoin and Ethereum, although the team is working on an exclusive MTRG-erc20 & MTR-erc20 bridge so MTR can be intergrated into ETH defi, and similar users and holders can have the added convienence to store MTR or MTRG in their popular erc20 wallets. More of these bridges by the team will allow for MTR PoW stablecoin to be intergated into other top blockchains like TRON, TOMO, Cardano, Wanchain and more!

(NOTE: The Meter blockchain is 100x faster than Ethereum.)

The Stablecoin market is rising fast and many in traditional finance (like JP Morgan) believe it will rival/surpass Bitcoin in marketcap and we all know Bitcoin is just getting warmed up.

It is truly unique and decentralized in its proposition, tokenomics and operations, so i won't be surprised to see more listings on cremé de la cremé exchanges very soon.

it may very well dethrone USDT, which no other stablecoin asset (centralized or otherwise) has been able to do.

Meter is backed by heavyweights, the likes of Pantera, with ecosystem partners like chainlink, and was listed on Coinmarketcap today. 

MTRG's present 2.1mil marketcap is peanuts when considering this governs a stablecoin asset with all the right partnerships & a 40 mil max supply released over the next...wait for it...400 years!!!

This is only the beginning of its ascent and popularity as the only PoW secure network surpassing bitcoin in speed and decentralization, and ofcourse Stability.

Suicide Stack : 350 mtrg

Marketcap at time of writing: $200K

Exchange: Probit, Cointiger, Oikos (Uniswap on Tron) **(Also listing on BITTREX in a few days)**

Centric is the world's first dual-cryptocurrency payment network. Its innovative and unique concept is engineered to achieve a breakthrough as a reliable form of payment. The first token, Centric Rise, is the network's transactional currency - it steadily increases in price hourly in accordance with immutable price blocks set publicly one year in advance. The second token, Centric Cash, is pegged to the first and will freely trade on major cryptocurrency exchanges. The exchange between the two tokens is governed by a decentralized protocol that self-regulates token supply to meet ongoing changes in demand. In combination, the two token relationships solve key problems experienced by first-generation cryptocurrency projects. On one hand, it offers a reliable store of value; on the other, it provides an upside incentive to join the network required for mass-adoption.

The project is a bit complicated, so it requires some research on your side. I could not include everything otherwise, it would be too long. Here is the FAQ page [https://www.joincentric.com/faq-general/](https://www.joincentric.com/faq-general/)  
The project is very new and it reminds me of RSR in the early days. One of the upcoming catalysts is a Bittrex listing which is in progress.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"$SUNDOG_TRX - Bringing Evolution to Memecoins Space
","At first glance, meme coins might seem like a simple concept due to how these cryptocurrencies are typically joke-themed tokens whose value rises and falls depending upon how many people like the underlying memes. However, SUNDOG hopes to solve this problem by creating a meme coin that’s both hilarious and technologically efficient. 

SUNDOG\_TRX is a meme coin on the TRON blockchain. It references dog-based (corgi breed) memes, and the $SUNDOG token is the standard token used for theSUNDOG\_TRX project. The primary purpose of the $SUNDOG token is entertainment, amusement, technological, and investment benefit. Meme enthusiasts can trade it back and forth for fun, but SUNDOG\_TRX also has some potential for investors. 



SUNDOG\_TRX aims to explore the viability of the SunPump meme coin platform, part of the TRON blockchain ecosystem, that’s designed to provide a supportive system for creating and trading meme coins. Unlike many other crypto platforms, such as Ethereum, SunPump encourages high trading volumes. Even when a SUNDOG token is traveling between thousands of wallets in a single day, SunPump keeps transaction fees and processing times as low as possible.

To further enhance the trading experience, SUNDOG provides options for customizing slippage settings and button configurations. Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which it is executed. By allowing users to adjust slippage settings, SUNDOG helps them avoid unexpected losses during volatile market conditions. Additionally, users can customize their buy and sell buttons, making it easier to manage their positions according to their trading strategies.

Though $SUNDOG might seem like yet one more meme coin, it has several unique features that make it worth exploring. SUNDOG is designed to perform like SHIB or DOGE, but it's marketed directly toward TRON members. This allows SUNDOG to get all the brand recognition of other dog-themed meme coins while offering the fresh new features of SunPump. Compared to many other meme coins, SUNDOG has undergone a lot of reliable, stable growth through late August and early September 2024. Therefore, SUNDOG is an ideal investment choice for investors looking for the next trending meme coin. 

$SUNDOG is an excellent example of how a simple concept can capture the hearts and minds of countless crypto enthusiasts. This corgi-themed coin has leveraged the power of the SunPump platform to reach millions of traders. Not only is SUNDOG one of the top meme coins on SunPump, but it's also managed to outperform many other types of crypto tokens.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"SUNDOG_TRX - The Dog on TRON That’s Going to the Sun
","In the crowded world of digital tokens, where countless projects promise extraordinary returns, $SUNDOG offers something different: a clear and thoughtful approach built on trust, adaptability, and community engagement.

The crypto space is often filled with technical terms and ambitious promises that leave many investors confused. $SUNDOG stands out by focusing on simplicity and transparency, ensuring that everyone involved understands the project’s goals. Unlike other tokens that rely on complicated whitepapers, $SUNDOG provides straightforward Token Documentation designed to educate and inform. This approach helps users feel more confident and connected to the project, fostering long-term involvement rather than short-term speculation.

The crypto world changes quickly, with new technologies and market trends emerging all the time. $SUNDOG’s development roadmap embraces this uncertainty by prioritizing flexibility. The team is committed to evolving alongside the industry, making $SUNDOG a project that aims to stay relevant no matter how the crypto landscape shifts.

This adaptability isn’t just a promise—it’s built into $SUNDOG’s design. By focusing on a structure that can grow and respond to new ideas, the project ensures its community stays at the forefront of innovation.

# A Transparent Approach

Transparency is at the heart of $SUNDOG. The project openly shares its plans and capabilities, avoiding exaggerated claims about guaranteed profits. Instead, $SUNDOG focuses on providing detailed, honest information about how the token works and what participants can expect. This clarity builds trust and positions $SUNDOG as a project that values its community above all else.

Importantly, $SUNDOG’s documentation is clear that it’s not providing investment advice. This distinction encourages users to make decisions based on understanding and personal research, not hype.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,$WINDY Success Imminent With Massive Dex Upgrade in 35 Hours 🔥," 

**Massive WINDY UPDATE**

Hey everyone! What is going on? Yesterday we spoke about some of the updates that WindSwap was releasing but today we have a little more clarity. It turns out the event will be held at Sunday 8PM UTC (this is when the DEX updates will go live) in a little over 35 hours.  

WindSwap has met huge milestones over the last month-

Coin Market Cap ✔

CoinGecko ✔

Advanced Charting ✔

Working DEX Platform ✔

Staking is now available ✔

Upgrade Of Website + Telegram Bot ✔

🔥 + Limit Orders Coming Soon.. 🔥

And more on the way soon...

As you can see from the dex.guru or poocoin chart, it is looking BULLISH. We arrived at 9K Telegram members today, and the market cap is still less than 10m.

**Why should I invest?**

I did some research about DEX tokens, and you can fundamentally divide them into two categories. Those who do deliver and those who don't. So far, the WindSwap team has delivered on every promise they made. Therefore, I believe wholeheartedly and logically that the market cap is absurdly undervalued: 10M for a working DEX market cap. To sum it up:

* Low Market Cap - Currently just $7M
* Rug Proof - 80% of Tokens are using for liquidity on Pancake Swap (99% Liquidity Locked on Unicrypt)
* High Organic Growth
* Holders are rapidly growing

**What Makes WindSwap Unique**

Windswap offers a comprehensive set of tools to assist our users to have a smooth experience when they transact tokens online. WindSwap already provides a live and fully functional exchange platform which can connect to popular wallets like Meta Mask, Trust Wallet among others and comes pre-loaded with a list of tokens that can be exchanged.

WindSwap allows you to trade nearly every BEP-20 token on the BSC network. We are now creating interactive real time charts, smart limit orders, due diligence (‘rug checking’) tools, and a cross-chain bridge capability to convert TRX or ETH network tokens to the BSC.

**Why only WindSwap and not others?**

The WindSwap team has offered us some things they wanted to implement. They are highly active in the telegram group. Here is a list of things they are working on as we speak:

* Slippage slider **(Already in**)
* Cross-chain swappin
* UI Improvements **(This Sunday)**
* Charting tools (**Already in**)
* Automatic Slippage
* Limit Orders **(Within Next 2 Weeks)**
* Due Diligence / Rug Checker

**In a Nutshell:**

A fresh competitor on the DEX market with highly engaging and secure features, with a token that rewards early adopters through the aggressive early-on, cycled burn pattern. By the time the burn cycles are completed, (50%)+ of the features will be there for you by the end of MAY. They are not aiming for a quick buck. Instead, they aim for a good product that will be active in the market for years to come.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,😀 WindSwap Limit Orders In 41.98 Hours. Don’t Miss This Historic Event!🔥," 

**Massive WindSwap Update Inbound**

Hi guys! I won’t bore you with the small talk, let me just express as a long term windy holder that I could not be more excited. 

We have waited a long time, and limit orders are coming to the WindSwap platform in under 42 hours.

We are expecting tremendous growth in our group and are spreading the word so no long term investors will miss out.

&#x200B;

Join 10,000+ other investors [➡ ](https://emojidictionary.emojifoundation.com/right_arrow)😀 [https://t.me/windswapmembers](https://t.me/windswapmembers) [👌](https://emojidictionary.emojifoundation.com/right_arrow)

**Short and Simple Summary of WindSwap**

* Low Market Cap - Currently just $1M
* High Tech DEX Platform
* Rapidly Developing
* 2.5 Month Track Record

WindSwap allows you to trade nearly every BEP-20 token on the BSC network. They’ve created interactive real time charts, smart limit orders, due diligence (‘rug checking’) tools, and are working on a cross-chain bridge capability to convert TRX or ETH network tokens to the BSC.

**In a Nutshell:**

A fresh competitor on the DEX market with highly engaging and secure features. They are not aiming for a quick buck. Instead, they aim for a good product that will be active in the market for years to come.

📃Whitelist Applications – None!

🛎Presale: None!

🚀Launch: Fair (August 6th)

The rewards coin community has proven to be one of the most active and fun communities the entire crypto space this 2021 altcoin season.

Iconic meme coins with popular names have made thousands millionaires this year alone, and most of them started as a joke. We are here to show you that not every coin on the BSC is a memecoin, and that in fact, a coin with utilization like Baby Tron has huge potential.

We are committed to this project long-term, all the while helping our holders pump their bags with TRX. Baby Tron is a simple-to-understand growth and rewards token built on some of the most sophisticated technology in the entire crypto space – the Binance Smart Chain. We are aware of the amount of scams on this platform, so if you have any questions don't hesitate to jump into Telegram and ask any of our team or community members. We are here to serve you!

What if you could earn free TRX, while your BBTRX bag grows?

This is a brand-new project that launched exactly 1 month ago — and gaining traction every day, spreading mostly by word of mouth. We haven’t even taken the plastic off. Our team is tight-lipped and plans on saving most of the marketing for after launch. The old “wen marketing” meme seems fitting here.

📃 If you're looking for a presale or a whitelist, you're in the wrong spot. Security will escort you out the door.

If you're looking for a token with solid fundamentals and an active team, then you're at the right place!

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,630K TRX in the first day - CETO's P3D but better,"I was in P3D (Power of Weak Hands) OG hourglass contract back in 2018 - it was great until it wasn't. Right after FOMO3D came out and it soared, the token crashed. 

This [CETO contract](https://crystalelephant.net) is a clone of P3D but with huge penalties if you withdraw before 30 days. Solves the old hourglass contract pump-and-dump problem. 

I did a [15 minute deep dive](https://youtu.be/7G3tGyz9cjc) on its testnet before it started yesterday. If you want the TL;DR, they have this [explainer](https://youtu.be/NJHaYm7Nm6U) from their site. I was among the first money in and I'm up 22% in a day even after the 10% per transaction fee. Token value's real low right now, too: 12 TRX per CETO. If this does anything like P3D did but without the PND, this \*is\* a legit moonshot. Just reinvest daily for 30 days and see what happens. I want that old P3D feeling!",0,2021-02-05 06:07:27,8

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,ComfyRise (A Crazy Story with Highest BNB Rewards) | Already Many BNB Automatically Received !!,"📱 Telegram: https://t.me/ComfyRise  
  
**Have you heard about ComfyRise?** The token with BNBRewards, Dip-Buy and AntiWhale mechanism? Well, I did, and me and a lot of people aped in on the presale that sold out just in 2 minutes. Their hard-cap was 600 BNB and it filled organically. Not like those others that are filled by bots in 10 seconds! And it was hyped as well, because liquidity was locked forever and it has a good project roadmap with its own locker.  
  
Since the beginning, the dev and team were so transparent and frank. Mainly the website www.comfyrise.com caught all of our eyes. It had fantastic graphics with extraordinary tokenomics that really blown me away! So the day came, and launch was postponed by 24 hours after a community poll with a whopping 200+ votes. I was so excited! Launch momentum was crazy as hell, people on VC and chat were bombarding with excitement but after launch began the most awkward situation ever! The coin was working just like a normal pump and dump coin and people started DMing the devs that no transaction fee was there! All hell broke loose, the devs were trying to resolve the issue and things went out of control. Man, for a moment, am I again going to face another rugpull just in front of me like this? So did everyone else!! It was a messy situation. Devs were not on either Chat or VC other than saying, 'Please wait' - that looked like a Youtube video buffering! We were all shattered that this was another hype rugpull that we have to get past but NO!!!!  
  
Then came the crazy plot-twist! Devs came back on VC and Chat and were very transparent about it and can be also seen on the contract itself that although transaction fees were set to 30% as anti-whale on launch but deploying on DxSale it had to be removed to 0% fees and after the launch, the Trx Fee was not reverting back to its normal or anti-whale fees. It was a hardcoded glitch on the code that wasn't found earlier in testnet/mainnet.  
  
So the contract was redeployed with LP out of their own pocket as liquidity was locked forever on DxSale, previous owners like me are either getting airdropped or compensated in BNB now. Finally all the fuds stopped, people started cheering for the Devs and the journey of a crazy disaster became a very good supportive community with really nice devs, team members and trustworthy people who you seldom find in the DeFi space now!  
  
But this is what gets even crazier! I hope the devs did not realise this but as they started the Liquidity Pool with a low MCAP - buyers are getting rewarded much more BNB than any other coins. I don't want to name, but I have had seen BNB reward coins giving me highest pay of 0.5 even after holding for many, many days. But this **COMFYRISE** is a true GEM! After only the first few transactions and two hours later I automatically received 1.5 BNB in my wallet!  
  
DYOR but I would definitely suggest checking out the www.comfyrise.com and join the community earning highest BNB rewards on DeFi!

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Introducing SAITAMA || Listed on CoinMarketCap and Coin Gecko || Community Owned || Huge Marketing Campaign Planned!!,"🔥 Don't miss SAITAMA token listing on Coinsbit! 🔥

💥 Dear users, we are glad to announce that SAITAMA token is available on Coinsbit!!

🌐 SAITAMA INU is a medium for traders, crypto enthusiasts, and ordinary people in general to be able to transact as currency, payment and monetary system as whole. The goal of the project is to create a simple and easy to use marketplace / application which not only stores digital crypto assets safely and securely but also have the tools users need to make important decisions when it comes to buying or selling goods through the platform.

💠 SAITAMA is an ERC20 token of the project. Every transaction contains a 2% distribution reward to the holders and another 2% is burned.

💵 Pair:
SAITAMA/mUSDT

1.  Saitama tokenomics: 49% burned at launch, 4% split between holders and burn wallet per trx. In 4 weeks we’ve gone from 49% to about 53% with less than $1 mill volume per week. Calculate a higher volume rate and we will create a supply squeeze within 6 months. Less in circulation drives the coin value through the roof. Basic supply vs demand concept. 

2. Market Cap: our MC is currently about $3 mill. The price variance to move the coin value is very low I.E. every trx no matter the size moves the value. If you buy $100 now all we need is a MC of $6 mill to double your money. $12 mill to quadrupole your initial investment. The ROI on your $100 is now 400%. A MC of $12 mill can be achieved in one day without even passing $1 mill in total volume. No brainer easy math. 

3. Community/dev support: by far the strongest community I’ve been a part of in my 3-4 years investing in crypto. Positive outlook, strong will for succeed and overall cohesiveness. Lots of bright and inspired minds throughout Saitama with the common goal of making this coin great. 

4. Use case: we are working on several use cases very unique to the crypto world that has not been done in the past. Every one says they’re going to donate to charities etc etc. we are taking this to the next level with our edutainment and other great projects to be revealed at a later date. 

5. Point of entry: buying now secures a spot as one of the first 4200 holders on a project that will surpass 500k holders in the future or more. Along the way, the price increases and your passive income becomes greater. In a defi based coin, he who holds the longest wins. Being able to look back and say “yea I was one of the first 3k holders of Saitama and held my bag until now” now that same $100 investment has 1000x by literally doing nothing.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,👌 WindSwap BSC’s Best Kept Gem!,"**Massive WINDY UPDATE**

Hi guys! How is life treating you? In my last post I was talking to you guys about some minor events we were having but this week WindSwap devs are about to blow the top off this token! There are some serious game changing updates which are about to take off, a few I’ll outline below: 

Advanced Charting ✔️

Working DEX Platform ✔️

Staking is now available ✔️

Coin Market Cap ✔️

CoinGecko ✔️

Upgrade Of Website + Telegram Bot ✔️

But wait there's more!

Join 10,000+ other investors ➡ 😀 https://t.me/windswapmembers 👌

**Why should I invest?**

I was doing some research regarding DEX tokens and there is a fundamental divide when it comes to two categories which stand out. A DEX platform which provides and those DEX platforms which don’t. WindSwap developers have broken out of the stereotype of forking and then vanishing, they have a track record and they consistently deliver on their roadmap. Every promise they’ve given has been executed on and is currently live on their platform. I can’t believe I got in on some a Gem and consider them absurdly undervalued at 3M for a DEX platform which is working and currently functions better than their competitors. To sum things up:

* Rug Proof - 80% of Tokens are using for liquidity on Pancake Swap (99% Liquidity Locked on Unicrypt)
* Low Market Cap - Currently just $3M
* High Organic Growth
* Holders are rapidly growing

**What Makes WindSwap Unique**

WINDY is offering all of us access to comprehensive tools that assists users when it comes to having a smooth experience transacting tokens online. WindSwap already provides a live and fully functioning exchange platform which can connect to popular wallets like Meta Mask, Trust Wallet among others and comes pre-loaded with a list of tokens that can be exchanged.

WindSwap allows you to trade nearly every BEP-20 token on the BSC network. We are now creating interactive real time charts, smart limit orders, due diligence (‘rug checking’) tools, and a cross-chain bridge capability to convert TRX or ETH network tokens to the BSC.

**Why only WindSwap and not others?**

The WindSwap team has offered us some things they wanted to implement. They are highly active in the telegram group. Here is a list of things they are working on as we speak:

* Slippage slider
* Cross-chain swapping
* UI Improvements
* Charting tools
* Automatic Slippage
* Limit Orders

**In a Nutshell:**

A fresh competitor on the DEX market with highly engaging and secure features, with a token that rewards early adopters through the aggressive early-on, cycled burn pattern. By the time the burn cycles are completed, (50%)+ of the features will be there for you by the end of June. They are not aiming for a quick buck. Instead, they aim for a good product that will be active in the market for years to come.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,😀 WindSwap A True BSC Gem!,"**Massive WINDY UPDATE**

Hi guys! How is life treating you? The last time we spoke, we had minor events. This weekend though we have some seriously game changing updates. First let’s check off the basics.

Coin Market Cap ✔️

Coin Gecko ✔️

Advanced Charting ✔️

Working DEX Platform ✔️

Staking is now available ✔️

Upgrade Of Website + Telegram Bot ✔️

More coming soon? Yes!  

Join 10,000+ other investors [➡ ](https://emojidictionary.emojifoundation.com/right_arrow)😀 [https://t.me/windswapmembers](https://t.me/windswapmembers) [👌](https://emojidictionary.emojifoundation.com/right_arrow)

**Why should I invest?**

Well. I did some research about DEX tokens, and you can fundamentally divide them into two categories. Those who do deliver and those who don't. So far, the WindSwap team has delivered on every promise they made. Therefore, I believe wholeheartedly and logically that the market cap is absurdly undervalued: 3m for a working DEX is a very low market cap. To sum it up:

* Low Market Cap - Currently just $3M
* Rug Proof - 80% of Tokens are using for liquidity on Pancake Swap (99% Liquidity Locked on Unicrypt)
* High Organic Growth
* Holders are rapidly growing

**What Makes WindSwap Unique**

Windswap offers a comprehensive set of tools to assist our users to have a smooth experience when they transact tokens online. WindSwap already provides a live and fully functional exchange platform which can connect to popular wallets like Meta Mask, Trust Wallet among others and comes pre-loaded with a list of tokens that can be exchanged.

WindSwap allows you to trade nearly every BEP-20 token on the BSC network. We are now creating interactive real time charts, smart limit orders, due diligence (‘rug checking’) tools, and a cross-chain bridge capability to convert TRX or ETH network tokens to the BSC.

**Why only WindSwap and not others?**

The WindSwap team has offered us some things they wanted to implement. They are highly active in the telegram group. Here is a list of things they are working on as we speak:

* Slippage slider
* Cross-chain swapping
* UI Improvements
* Charting tools
* Automatic Slippage
* Limit Orders 

**In a Nutshell:**

A fresh competitor on the DEX market with highly engaging and secure features, with a token that rewards early adopters through the aggressive early-on, cycled burn pattern.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,WindSwap $WINDY - 🔥 Exciting DEX Upgrade This Sunday 🔥," 

**Massive WINDY UPDATE**

Hi guys! How is life treating you? The last time we spoke, we had minor events. This Sunday though we have some seriously game changing updates. Have a read below:

Coin Market Cap ✔️

Coin Gecko ✔️

Advanced Charting ✔️

Working DEX Platform ✔️

Staking is now available ✔️

Upgrade Of Website + Telegram Bot ✔️

🔥 + Limit Orders Coming Soon.. 🔥

More coming soon? Yes!  

By the way, the chart is looking VERY BULLISH. We arrived at 9K Telegram members today, and the market cap is still just 7M.

**Why should I invest?**

I did some research about DEX tokens, and you can fundamentally divide them into two categories. Those who do deliver and those who don't. So far, the WindSwap team has delivered on every promise they made. Therefore, I believe wholeheartedly and logically that the market cap is absurdly undervalued: 10M for a working DEX market cap. To sum it up:

* Low Market Cap - Currently just $7M
* Rug Proof - 80% of Tokens are using for liquidity on Pancake Swap (99% Liquidity Locked on Unicrypt)
* High Organic Growth
* Holders are rapidly growing

**What Makes WindSwap Unique**

Windswap offers a comprehensive set of tools to assist our users to have a smooth experience when they transact tokens online. WindSwap already provides a live and fully functional exchange platform which can connect to popular wallets like Meta Mask, Trust Wallet among others and comes pre-loaded with a list of tokens that can be exchanged.

WindSwap allows you to trade nearly every BEP-20 token on the BSC network. We are now creating interactive real time charts, smart limit orders, due diligence (‘rug checking’) tools, and a cross-chain bridge capability to convert TRX or ETH network tokens to the BSC.

**Why only WindSwap and not others?**

The WindSwap team has offered us some things they wanted to implement. They are highly active in the telegram group. Here is a list of things they are working on as we speak:

* Slippage slider **(Already in**)
* Cross-chain swappin
* UI Improvements **(This Sunday)**
* Charting tools (**Already in**)
* Automatic Slippage
* Limit Orders **(Within Next 2 Weeks)**
* Due Diligence / Rug Checker

**In a Nutshell:**

A fresh competitor on the DEX market with highly engaging and secure features, with a token that rewards early adopters through the aggressive early-on, cycled burn pattern. By the time the burn cycles are completed, (50%)+ of the features will be there for you by the end of MAY. They are not aiming for a quick buck. Instead, they aim for a good product that will be active in the market for years to come.

Inspired by the same, the Baby Aetherius project was conceptualized to be a support-oriented derivative of the parent undertaking. It offers marvelous rewards in the form of Aetherius coins to its investors for as long as they hold shares of the Baby Aetherius currency.

We believe that we can work side-by-side with the main Aetherius token to maximize the earnings of investors by providing them with a two-pronged option in growing their investments.

Baby Aetherius, a low cap token on it's way to the moon! The contract is verified in BSC. We created something simple, that the token holders can hold as a store of value.

Our mission is to help make people's lives better, by holding our token. We hope to create a community of like-minded individuals to grow together with the purpose of acquiring new riches that await us in the future.

Join our community to promote this hidden gem. Earn rewards by holding and telling your friends and family about this token. We don't wish to be priced on hype, but rather based on the merits and achievements of this token in the project’s lifespan.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,EverIncome Coin| |Decentralised Social Networking Platform Live | Fair Launch Live | 24 Hours to Go | PancakeSwap in 48 hours | Multi-Utility with Passive Income | Team To Be Kyc'ed | Big Marketing Coming | BSC Token,"**What is EverIncome Coin?**

EIC is a hyper deflationary token that rewards you passive income with $BUSD reflections. Besides $BUSD rewards, EverIncome is creating an ecosystem that brings the best of Defi to our community.

All holders of $EIC will earn an 8% reward from every Buy/Transfer/Sell Transaction in Binance pegged USD ($BUSD), which is automatically sent to your wallet. This generates a stable passive income for all holders, which they will receive every month.

There are various strategies in place to decrease the supply of EverIncome Coin over time, meaning individual holdings will become more valuable and receive a higher proportion of rewards.

Via BuyBack & Burn, 2% $EIC is collected from every transaction and converted to BNB, which are stored in the contract. When BuyBack & Burn is enabled, the contract purchases $EIC directly from exchanges, driving the price up, and immediately and permanently removes those purchased tokens from circulating supply by sending them to the contract ‘Burn’ address. This means less circulating supply, so a higher share of rewards paid to holders.

There are great benefits for being a EverIncome holder – like our unique revenue model and our social platform like facebook. In addition, our token metrics provide for a 8% BUSD reflections or rewards. With the above model, it’s hard not to feel excited about the future of EverIncome and your holdings. 

**Our products**

1. EIC Social, a facebook-like social platform with an engage-to-earn system that rewards members who engage with their friends and with the community; imagine getting passive income for every like, post, comment you make on the platform. The product aims to be ready before launch.
2. NFT Marketplace, it will be an NFT marketplace built on BSC focusing highly on user experience and ease of use to create, buy, sell and trade NFTs.The product will be developed in 2022 Q2 and launched in 2022 Q3.
3. Play-To-Earn, it will be a shooting game similar to Counter-Strike, where users can buy and sell weapons, equipments and earn EIC tokens from tournaments, you will need some EIC tokens for the game. This is a great way to create utility for EIC itself.The product will be developed in 2022 Q3 and launched in 2023 Q1.

will pump, Safe ETH will gigapump since it's a much lower mcap. Don't say I didn't warn you...

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,PengyOS the web3 memecoin on Solana - Solana Mobile collaboration - Project lead doxed - Attended Demo day in Berlin,"Have been part of this of this project since April.

I will gve my honest view on why I think that this project will do very well.

**What is $POS?**

$POS ( PengyOS ) is a web3 memecoin,that combines memes & web3 into one hub.

They call it the Solana HUB,it features a unique user experience.

Where you can use multiple dApps & simultaniously game & enjoy entertainment.

A webOS and a App that they recently developed.

They just had a collboration with Solana Mobile,

which they take regular meetings with.

Their App is also features on the SAGA dApp store.

https://preview.redd.it/qvxo28dh8eud1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b376f19717ec36c7f06bf3decbd0f7b08e393cd

**Why am I bullish on $POS?**

They have submitted for the radar hackathon.

Through Solana Mobile they got in contact with superteam.

Which is why they will present their project live in Berlin October 9th.

This project has so much to offer, the merging of web3 with memes is a great innitiative on Solana.

There are unlimitted possibilities with what they have build & continue to build

Overall their Team especially their Project lead are very based, and always communicating with the community.

https://preview.redd.it/9oy071zi8eud1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c680fb42f064709a7ad1bbf17ac75fe9bdcb68a

**What could $POS improve?**

Them being a pumpfun launch, we all know that funds can be difficult.

Altough I must admit that they recently started working with the whales of the project to fund possible listings.

They understand the market very well, and know that a possible exchange that requires supply will not do them any good at the current market cap.

So they took the step to apply for a listing at Kraken, which requires no fees.

https://preview.redd.it/0oonb1ak8eud1.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&s=24a1ee8dc5d991b50268627186a443f7ca7bf839

**How did i find $POS?**

Funny enough I found it on reddit, and was blown away by their website, and the amount of dedication and willpower they have to keep going.

And their efforts on the highs and the lows have kept me locked in.

https://preview.redd.it/66j4g6rl8eud1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=210b4534da207522a5367237e7d75dfbfdc71719

**Why am I posting about $POS?**

I like a good project when I see one, and I think Solana lacks this in many ways.

This Team and the token in generall have the potential for something great.

And they are definitely putting in the work to grow organically, without the pump & dumps that we all dislike.

It is well worth 5 minutes of your time to check this project out,

do your own dilligence and invest at your own risk.

This opposite relationship builds up a supply and demand scenario.

We had a massive launch of our BSC token **yesterday being #1 on dextools** all day for BSC coins and our ERC coin is picking up steam as well. 🚀🚀🚀

\#**UPDATES**:

Binance Smart Chain launch with a bridge coming soon. Large marketing efforts underway with influencers and much more planned. Come check us out

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,$KAI The Asian Moonshot with guaranteed mass adoption that will propel the project to a multi billion $ market cap ...,"PREPARE TO READ ABOUT A PROJECT THAT WILL GIVE YOU UNFATHOMABLE GAINS - ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HODL.

Kardiachain, the hybrid blockchain solution launched earlier this year. I was lucky to have found it early and rode good gains. Since then it has made a large retrace as most alts have. It is lying 230th on Coingeko with a ridiculous MC of £30M. So why is this a moonshot - buckle up, read this till the end, all the dots connect, Kardiachain will become mass adopted by millions.

&#x200B;

1. &#x200B;

* Kardiachain is government endorsed to be a digital payments system. Price Water House Cooper recognise Vietnam as one of the fastest growing economies in Asia and for the mobile payments sector. Kardiachain aims to make the millions of bankless citizens bankable with their mobile app. They have signed up with the three largest telecom companies in Vietnam to deliver DeFi products. Kai will become the Wechat/Alipay of the country [https://paypay.me/vietnam-mobile-payment-sings-grows-fast.html/#:\~:text=Currently%2C%20the%20five%20major%20mobile,between%2030%25%20and%2090%25](https://paypay.me/vietnam-mobile-payment-sings-grows-fast.html/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20the%20five%20major%20mobile,between%2030%25%20and%2090%25)

&#x200B;

2) - Kardiachain is the first to agree to provide the national stable coin $VNDC. Also the government aims to have Vietnam as 100% digital payments ASAP. [https://kardiachain.medium.com/vndc-issues-vietnam-most-prominent-stablecoin-on-kardiachain-7047413c7209](https://kardiachain.medium.com/vndc-issues-vietnam-most-prominent-stablecoin-on-kardiachain-7047413c7209)

&#x200B;

3) - Kardiachain has a patent for non invasive dual node technology. This alone is a game changer. This means $KAI can connect any blockchain. The amazing thing is they can do it without others knowing. As an example they piloted this using their KSML markup language with $NEO blockchain. They never told $NEO. After nearly a year of collecting data they showed $NEO the results. $NEO Promptly signed a partnership with Kardiachain. This has huge potential . Meaning chains that want to work together can do seamlessly using Kardiachain. [https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/cryptocurrency-news/partnerships/neo-ecoboost-partners-with-kardiachain/](https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/cryptocurrency-news/partnerships/neo-ecoboost-partners-with-kardiachain/)

The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance just signed up aswell as others. There will be an avalanche of chains wanting to use $KAI. You know what that means - huge demand [https://kardiachain.medium.com/kardiachain-joins-forces-with-eea-to-help-foster-mass-blockchain-adoption-in-asia-f9029f8315e2](https://kardiachain.medium.com/kardiachain-joins-forces-with-eea-to-help-foster-mass-blockchain-adoption-in-asia-f9029f8315e2)

15 New gensis validator partnerships are about to be announced due to the dual node technology. $THETA was announced just today as the first of a rapid series of coming announcements.

&#x200B;

4) - Kardiachain is more than a payments solution. They are working towards creating an interoperable eco system chain that can connect numerous industries together including **Education, Job recruitment, Business, Banking, DeFi Services, Data management -** the use cases are endless. This is not some grandiose scheme. Plans are already underway to create the first smart city in Vietnam. [https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@tranhaison/kardiachain-builds-a-smart-city-with-the-blockchain-ecosystem](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@tranhaison/kardiachain-builds-a-smart-city-with-the-blockchain-ecosystem)

One of the first areas the project is expanding into is Esports and betting which is a Billion dollar industry in Vietnam alone. 

[https://medium.com/kardiachain/kardiachain-is-expanding-into-e-sports-a-billion-dollar-industry-in-vietnam-3d606d8a3895](https://medium.com/kardiachain/kardiachain-is-expanding-into-e-sports-a-billion-dollar-industry-in-vietnam-3d606d8a3895)

&#x200B;

5) - Numerous large billion dollar companies have signed up to use Kardiachain including

I could write so much more re partnerships, If you're interested you will DYOR

&#x200B;

6) - The team - The tech team behind Kardiachain are ex Berkley Uni grads that went on to become lead technicians at Google. They gave all that up to start Kardiachain up. The advisory board is full of national officials. You know there will be no red tape with this steam rolling across Vietnam. [https://kardiachain.io/our-team/](https://kardiachain.io/our-team/)

&#x200B;

7) - Kardiachain have always stated their plan is to create something amazing in Vietnam. Once they can show case Vietnam to neighbouring countries they expect to expand there. This can become a multi billion dollar organisation easily.

&#x200B;

8) - The team have been creative in educating the population with Kardiachain. Every Vietnamese student has been given a Kai wallet under the student initiative. They can use their Kai to pay for things like taxis as Kai have teamed up with the largest Taxi Company in Vietnam. They have also teamed up with the biggest Youtube Media series in Vietnam that has millions of views . See these youtube links -

&#x200B;

9) - Vietnam is set for economic boom. The timing for Kardiachain is perfect. Vietnam along with 14 other countries have signed the biggest free trade deal in the world. There is massive investment coming to Vietnam. Also many of Japans large manufacturing plants are relocating to Vietnam. The countries GDP and digitalisation is ready for great growth. The stars are all aligning for this project.

10) - Ex KPMG Banking Manager leads the set up for an amazing staking opportunities via mainnet. Sustainable and highly lucrative with a new take on how interest is paid.

&#x200B;

11) - I will leave you with the roadmap. Mainnet is launching within two weeks. I for one only hodl three tokens. They all for me have 3 essential ingredients - Addressing Real World Issues, Talented team with innovative technology, guaranteed mass adoption. $KAI is one of my three. You should consider it too before people realise what this will become. For me this is a buy and forget, a retirement pot. We are living in the digital gold rush.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,TOP MOON PROJECT: Freight Trust Token (EDI) Baseline soon: 700k$ Mcap,"TOP MOON PROJECT: Freight Trust Token (EDI)

✅ $700k Market Cap

✅ Concentrated holdings, with only 290 wallets. Easily pumpable

✅ Part of Baseline Protocol

✅ Paperless & Frictionless Smart Contract enabled Digital Freight

✅ Management Platform – Easily integrable with any CRM’s software 

&#x200B;

Traditional shipping has too many mundane processes involved with each stakeholders such as freight forwarders, shipping companies, ports, cargo etc. EDI plans to solve such problems with the use of blockchain tech and smart contracts, eliminating inefficiencies found in the industry today. 

&#x200B;

EDI is also part of Baseline Protocol; by September they will be part of the regulatory committee for Baseline Protocol. Unibright (UBT) did a 50x due to its association with Baseline. 

&#x200B;

Revenue Model

$1 that’s the average cost for an EDI message , with EDI you can do with very less amount of gas 10x more tx. Assuming:

Echo Global Logistics pays about $1 for each transaction and EDI do 10,000+ a day. If you can get < .75-.50 per trx. You will be able to get well over 1m a day within a few years.

&#x200B;

Upcoming News:

🚀 EDI is in the midst of launching their own regulated commodity trading exchange; awaiting regulatory permission from the state of Wyoming, USA.

🚀 The proposed exchange will have a fiat on off ramp and financial institutions such as banks can participate in futures trading

🚀 ETF offering probably in Jan 2021; will be based on Freight Prices 

🚀 Staking: Innovative format - for eg. the min. guarantee rate is the current lowest APR for USDC + DAI on whatever lending protocol we are using, principle isn't removed from the protocol for lending only added. Principle is added from fee's earned from 1) customers 2) exchange referrals 3) other sources of revenue the other part of that is the matching rate for EDI so whatever the payout is in USD terms for staking is matched with using EDI for as long as feasible (the google sheet) (staking testnet wallet: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xcda76fc63dfb068e642d69eeb0d71531d2813327](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcda76fc63dfb068e642d69eeb0d71531d2813327)) for 1500$ you make 15$ in 6 hours that’s 60$ per day 😊 calculate your profits in a month

&#x200B;

￼ Anti-whale Mechanics

&#x200B;

￼ LAUNCH

&#x200B;

Our team chose a fair launch for many reasons. We think this is much better than a pre-sale launch. And you can see for yourself if you study other projects and their launches. Fewer bots, no token sales during listing on PancakeSwap, everyone has the same purchase conditions, proof that the team has money and serious intentions for development, since liquidity will be added by the team and locked for 12 months, more organic launch and trading volume.

&#x200B;

￼ SECURITY OF LAMBO

&#x200B;

￼ Locked Liquidity

&#x200B;

Initial liquidity will be locked for a minimum of 12 months to provide holders with peace of mind that the token can always be exchanged. A trusted 3rd party, DXSALE, will operate as the middle man to ensure that all raised liquidity is locked in a secure locker for the full timeframe.

&#x200B;

￼ Verified and Latest Version

&#x200B;

The contract code will be verified on BscScan and fully open. You can study it before buying our token. Also, our code will be written on the latest version of the compiler, which excludes the possibility of ""honeypot"" or other fraudulent manipulations.

&#x200B;

OTHER FEATURES

&#x200B;

Anti-Dump Logic

&#x200B;

Price protection features such as max tx on sells are included. Any transaction selling more than 0.1% of total supply will be rejected. This prevents massive one time sells that drastically alter the token price.

&#x200B;

Extra 3% Sell fee

&#x200B;

Swing trading is a common practice that can affect price action. To incentivize holding and reducing pump/dump dynamics, we added an extra 3% sell fee on top of the initial 17% transaction fee.

&#x200B;

The most important thing to note: We are launching $BABYMATIC$ on APESWAP instead of pancakeswap due to the low liquidity of Matic on pancakeswap.

&#x200B;

Apeswap is pretty much a carbon copy of pancakeswap and you won't find any difference to buy/sell there, check here for yourself - [https://app.apeswap.finance/swap](https://app.apeswap.finance/swap) 

&#x200B;

But Do not worry, we are still trading on the Binance Smart Chain and we are still trading with BNB!

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,💎TorrentSwap💎 - BitTorrent Chain's first full-featured AMM DEX. Their Presale ends soon.,"The first ever DEX is launching on BTTC.

You who know I'm always looking for that next one.  I think I've found it, here's a breakdown I did, make your own decision.

HURDLES

There was one part of the process that could have been easier, though it's not the fault of the TorrentSwap team.  It's just difficult to get bridged over to the chain.  You have to start on TRON and buy a little TRX for gas, then buy your BTT tokens (needed for gas on BTTC).  Then you have to put in your wallet settings in (most likely) Metamask

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Oscarswap.com | Comparison Between Uniswap & Oscarswap |Top #1 DEX on Arbitrum | KYC | AUDIT,"**Uniswap**

Uniswap protocol facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Features**

Concentrated LiquidityLiquidity that is allocated within a custom price range. In earlier versions, liquidity was distributed uniformly along the price curve between 0 and infinity.

**Protocol Fee**

Uniswap v3 has a protocol fee that can be turned on by UNI governance. Compared to v2, UNI governance has more flexibility in choosing the fraction of swap fees that go to the protocol.

**Oracle**

Storing price and liquidity history directly in the pool contract substantially reduces the potential for logical errors on the part of the calling contract.

**Range Orders**

In Range orders target asset will be available for withdrawal after the spot price has crossed the full range of the order.

**Token Integration**

Rebasing tokens will succeed in pool creation and swapping, but liquidity providers will bear the loss of a negative rebase when their position becomes active, with no way to recover the loss.

**Fee Structure**

There is a 0.3% fee for swapping between ETH and ERC20 tokens. This fee is split by liquidity providers proportional to their contribution to liquidity reserves. There are no platform fees.

**OSCAR SWAP Features**

Main Features

Some of its main feature are Higher APR, Efficiency, Top-Tier Partnership, Low Trx Fee,& High Yield.

**Liquidity Pools**

At Oscarswap, users can earn LP tokens as proof of providing liquidity. By this users receive OSCAR-ETH LP tokens that represent a proportional share of the pooled assets.

**DEX**

Yield Farming rewards are 3 coins. One of the coins is the Oscarswap native token $OSCAR, the second is WETH, and lastly, a stable coin.

**Farming Reward Working**

Here users deposit their LP tokens into the chosen farm, and the platform will automatically start distributing rewards based on the amount of stake.

**Adjustable Stakers**

Users with the opportunity to stake their $OSCAR tokens without a predefined lock-up period are known as adjustable stakers.

**L2 Bridges**

L2 Bridges have been tested over time and provide great liquidity with minimal slippage.

Yield Farming Reward

$OSCAR/USDC – 2165%

WBTC/ETH – 413%

BTC/USDC – 400%

ETH/USDC – 270%

FeeA 0.25%

fee is charged on the trade. From this fee, 0.05% is returned to the liquidity pool and the 0.05% for LP rewards 0.02% for the team 0.08% for treasury fund 0.10% for staking rewards.

**Governance**

Governance is used in decisions, such as, Token allocation, new feature introduction, Reward allocation, and vesting periods etc.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,X-Punks Exclusive NFT Series By IncryptX,"X-World is the name given to a project by the Gaming Department of IncryptX, whose primary research focus is blockchain based gaming, and the integration of NFT's & De-Fi with gaming.

   X-World will be a community developed metaverse consisting of virtual NFT art galleries and various arcade, card style and RPG games.

X-PUNKS by IncryptX is an NFT series consisting of 10,000 unique hand-drawn characters represented by Digital Trading cards that will have future utility in X-World. The monster cards will be Avatars in the metaverse, and the cards will be used in a dual-style digital trading card game. X-Punks Trading cards will be minted on multiple blockchains as the X-World Metaverse will aim to make cross-chain interoperability in blockchain gaming a reality.

   X-Punks can be found on:

1. [https://unifty.io/bsc/farm-view.html?address=0xf9Fd9575A00F901b40F1579D327a504b6B795d10](https://unifty.io/bsc/farm-view.html?address=0xf9Fd9575A00F901b40F1579D327a504b6B795d10)

2. [https://opensea.io/collection/x-punks](https://opensea.io/collection/x-punks)

 Each monster card has its own unique attributes, which can be boosted by combining them with appropriate magic and item cards ; Each item and magic card has its own level of rarity: Common, Rare, Ultra Rare, Legendary, Mystical,

 Background on IncryptX:

   INCRYPT.x is a full spectrum blockchain project. The team behind INCRYPT.x is building the Incrypt Eco-system; a series of interlinked blockchain based projects. The INCRYPT token is the fuel that powers the system. The INCRYPT token follows a deflationary protocol and has Static Yield Farming mechanisms implemented.

The idea is simple; we want to push the boundaries of De-Fi, and create a completely transparent and decentralized community controlled Investment Fund built on the protocols for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO).

 DE-FI

The first part of the Incrypt Eco-System is the Community Based De-Fi Investment fund; funds will be autonomously generated through the INCRYPT tokenomics. where 4% of every transaction is pooled into the ‘De-Fi’ wallet for investment purpose. Further tokenomics allow for token holders to receive passive income generated from reflection tax, also known as ‘static yield farming’, There will also be the option to earn additional income by staking ‘wrapped’ INCRYPT tokens, and earning income in MATIC, TRX, ETH and BNB.

 DAO

A decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a network of stakeholders with no central governing body, just a set of rules encoded on the blockchain, this allows for seamless and autonomous management, and removes the traditional issues associated with financial management such as bottlenecking and corruption. It creates a fully transparent and trustless system. The DAO will control the De-Fi wallet and the graphical interface for DAO will be built on a blockchain domain; incrypt.dao, which benefits from increased security and is censorship resistant. The DAO will house a blockchain based voting system. Based on this model, the community will be able to submit ‘investment proposals’, and token holders will be able to connect their wallet to the GUI of the DAO and cryptographically cast their vote on a proposal (that covers investment strategy, dividend distribution etc.) for the pooled funds in the ‘de-fi’ wallet. The token holders will have direct control, as the DAO will only execute proposals that have been voted on. The full whitepaper covers expected problems, along with proposed solutions, such as ‘reputation flow’ which will protect the DAO from corruption and malicious actors.

 NFT

   INCRYPT tokens will have additional utility besides the de-fi aspect; an exclusive NFT Marketplace is being developed, which connects artists with licensed cannabis growers to create ‘Cannabuddies’; Unique digital NFT trading cards that enables the holder to claim physical grams of cannabis from licensed dispensaries. The X-World Metaverse will be based around characters that exist on Digital Trading cards known as X-Punks

 Incrypt Smart Chain

   In the works, as a potential future project, is the Incrypt Smart Chain; a multi-layered blockchain aimed at securing data transactions while maintaining individual user privacy. The Incrypt Smart Chain will have multiple cross-chain bridges to allow for liquid swaps across multiple blockchains and will be built specifically for hosting DAOs. The vision is that the Incrypt Smart Chain will be known as the ‘De-fi Chain’ where investment companies could register their fund, and get access to decentralized funding, while giving individual investors full transparency and traceability of funds. With tokenized stocks and forex derivatives becoming mainstream, the Incrypt Smart chain will be the gateway to all financial products. We are also exploring the possibility of having a satellite broadcast the Incrypt Smart Chain Network in the future.

Incrypt Wallet with Built in DEX

In the works is a GUI multi-currency wallet built on a mobile app, that will allow users to store INCRYPT and other cryptos, and stake directly in-app. There will be built in bridges to the routers of many Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) to allow users to trade directly in app. Incrypt Token holders will also be able to access the DAO interface directly in-app and submit, view and vote on Investment Proposals.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,StellarSwip 💸 has verified on Bsc-scan,"💎 $StellarSwip is a leading slide DeFi token built to succeed.

CA: 0x1ee53ded7c6b17620e59f4de84640e01ecf94bbb

The main purpose behind $StellarSwip is to offer a de-centralised

transactions mesh which operate on the Binance (BSC) services.

The roadmap built for $StellarSwip is dedicated by market fluctuations,

but the model it operates on begs $StellarSwip to victory. $StellarSwip is a slide token with a peak circulating supply of 1,000,000,000,000,000.

On each trx, a tax of 2% will be distributed to the Hodler

and the extra 2% will be burnt,

hence offering holders to hodl and decline the supply time to time.

As the supply decreases, the scarcity of the token increases.

This opposite relationship builts up a supply and demand scenario.

It is further added, there is no limit fixed as to how many tokens can be burnt.

Without a burning limit you know what happens next.

🔥 Transaction network which operate on the Binance smart chain (BSC). 🔥

🔥 Listed on PancakeSwap. 🔥

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,T2X - Next level staking,"So what is T2X? It's a staking token on the Tron chain. It's similar to HEX but it's definitely more lucrative than HEX and not so scammy.

Here are some details about it:

* Started 13 days ago
* You basically swap TRX for T2X and then stake T2X
* By staking T2X you receive more T2X and also TRX dividends each day!
* 95% of all TRX that was collected while swapping to T2X will return as dividends to users that stake T2X
* There is no exchange or coin aggregator yet that lists T2X. It's fresh and new!
* Their own DEX is coming soon
* Every stake will get a bonus day every 5 days that it has been active. So if you stake for 10 days, you receive rewards for 12 days
* At the first day 5 million T2X were distributed. This is going down slowly until it hits 1 million. Currently it's at 4.868 million.
* Depending on number of users that enter the T2X auction daily, you receive T2X tokens end of the day

Here is an example how it works: If 2 million TRX are collected today because users want to swap it to T2X, each user that entered the auction will receive 2.43 T2X per TRX (because daily limit of T2X is currently 4.86 million). Simultaneously the users that already stake T2X will receive their share of the 2 million TRX as dividends according to the size if their stake of T2X.

You can reinvest the TRX dividends you receive and swap for more T2X or just be happy with the TRX you receive daily in your own wallet :-)

That's a brief summary. The Staking Portal has all the info you need to understand the details. The system is really simple but has complex implications. Different staking strategies are possible.

Basic workflow is:

1. Install TronLink Chrome extension
2. Visit Staking Portal
3. Enter the auction and send TRX to receive T2X end of the day
4. After you received it, stake it for the time you want
5. Next day, collect dividends and decide what to do with your acquired T2X and TRX

Video Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moz_9BNfoi0  

**The staking portal link has my Reflink. That will earn you 5% more T2X tokens at stake end and an extra 10% T2X for me. So you definitely want to use a Reflink! If you invite 5 friends yourself you get 50% more T2X tokens!**",3,2020-07-24 14:28:11,31

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"Sentivate (SNTVT) | Price: $0.0053 | Competitor to ETH, EOS, ADA | Unique Hybrid Web Product","Sentivate: [https://sentivate.com](https://sentivate.com/) 

Price per token: $0.0053 

Current market cap: 15.2M USD

This project is still flying under many people's radars, though it has experienced solid growth in the past few months.

Sentivate is producing what Ethereum failed to create - a hybrid web that merges aspects of both the decentralized web and centralized web together, so that all of the resources of both ecosystems will be available to developers on the platform and thus, users.

It is a full, complete ""internet"" being built from scratch with its own version of DNS (with their own Domain Registrar), HTTP (it will be called UDSP), and more. The ability to produce hApps (hybrid apps) will be far superior to ETH's current system because they can incorporate centralized components when needed to do some of the ""heavy lifting"" of the hApp, while keeping it sufficiently decentralized by allowing users to control their own addresses/keys, vote for governance, etc.

The current market cap is $15,220,000. Compare this to its competitors like ETH, EOS, TRX, and ADA that all have market caps in the billions, and this project could easily 50x or more in value over the next year or two, if successful. SNTVT will be exchanged for their mainnet coin Viat when the Universal Web is launched.

It is worth learning more about this project now while it is still so early. Read more about it, join the Telegram, and think about the potential for the types of products developers will be building in a hybrid system like this when it is released. I'm a blockchain developer myself and plan to build out some really interesting projects on Sentivate when the network has launched.

Elon was the Doge Father but he adopted a new baby doge, He is the Step Daddy.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,LittleBabyNinja 100% SAFU | Fair Launch [Low Market Cap],"LittleBabyNinja is a leading slide DeFi token built to succeed.

&#x200B;

CA: 0x481dee69e78378db7ee758f36511e1782d4680cd

&#x200B;

The main purpose behind LittleBabyNinja is to offer a de-centralised

&#x200B;

transactions mesh which operate on the Binance (BSC) services.

&#x200B;

The roadmap built for LittleBabyNinja is dedicated by market fluctuations,

&#x200B;

but the model it operates on begs LittleBabyNinja to victory. 

&#x200B;

LittleBabyNinja is a slide token with a peak circulating supply of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.

&#x200B;

On each trx, a tax of 2% will be distributed to the Hodler

&#x200B;

and the extra 8% will be burnt,

&#x200B;

hence offering holders to hodl and decline the supply time to time.

&#x200B;

As the supply decreases, the scarcity of the token increases.

&#x200B;

This opposite relationship builts up a supply and demand scenario.

&#x200B;

It is further added, there is no limit fixed as to how many tokens can be burnt.

&#x200B;

Without a burning limit you know what happens next.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Legacy Network - last chance to get on board,"Ok, so this coin has been posted here before, but it's been ignored and that's to your advantage. Here's the tldr:

- fork from Tron, goal is to be a DPOS blockchain where staking earns you rewards in USDL, Legacy stable coin.

- $12m market cap, 1303 holders, current price is $0.0011 per token.

- staking opportunity (48%apy) starts in a couple days, last one before mainnet launches in Q3/4 2021

- majority (~70%) of tokens ALREADY LOCKED UP in other staking options for another ~90 days

- maximum supply listed is 100b, BUT there has already been some token burns and there will be more.

- 33 billion tokens to be locked in permanent staking, reducing total effective supply to 21 billion (80% less than Tron).

- very active community, non anonymous devs are very involved in the chat and provide support and guidance

Can be bought in Biki (no kyc, where final staking will happen), uniswap, and bilaxy.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,🍼 🐶 Welcome to Baby Jeju 🐶 🍼 ✨. Presale coming this week! Dev has successfully launched tokens to 20m+ MC. This will be no different. Come to the telegram and see for yourself!,"✨ 🍼 🐶  Welcome  to  Baby  Jeju  🐶 🍼 ✨

With all the new hype reward tokens it was only a matter of time before Jeju presented to you the first and best project of it's kind. Tired of rugs? Faulty codes? Rewards that don't work? Rewards that you don't want? Well here's the solution! 

We are the first project that will allow you to choose which dividends you want.

The way this works is simple but elegant, On every Transaction there is a Tax , that tax coverts to a pool which then rewards the holders in the selected dividends. 

This means instead of receiving tokens in reflections you will be able to receive from a selection of multiple dividend pools.

So far we have the following selection for the public to choose from at any time.

🔸 CAKE - Pancake Swap Token
      LINK - Chainlink
🔸 XRP  - Ripple
      BUSD - Binance USD
🔸 ADA - Cardano
      ETH - Ethereum
🔸 BTC - Bitcoin
     BAKE - Bakery Swap Token
🔸 TRX - Tron
      XTZ - Tezos
🔸 BNB - Binance Token

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"Why $Blink will make you rich (Not a shit coin, has an actual project behind it and is owned by Wink)","Basically $wink is an online gambling casino built on the Tron network (trx)... Now $wink has partnered up with Binance which is why you’ve seen $wink fly! But the best is yet to come as binance has invested into $wink by helping them create a new token called $blink which is identical to $wink (not a rip off legit owned by the same people, so will be promoted by $wink) and the key difference is rather than it be a casino for the tron network, it will be one on the binance smart chain network... 

Basically $blink right now is only available on Pancake swap, it currently has a market cap of $29bil (up heaps already) but considering the binance smart chain network is significantly larger than the tron network (go check bnb vs trx) one can safely assume that this token should match its tron counterpart... and here is where it gets interesting, cause $wink has a market cap of 800mil.... this is a 30x return if $blink just matches it... and with the craze around “cheap tokens that could moon” rather than “sound technology that will outlast us” the idea is this is possible the only thing in its way, is the fact that you can access $wink on binance, a major exchange. But do you think $blink will get listed there? It’s almost a certainty, with BSC supporting projects that are built on their network, it’s really only a matter of time....

normally I don’t like online gambling tokens but we are so deep into this bull run if you want x10-x30 you can’t just target good technology you have to go with whatever is the “fad coin” for example NFTs are basically junk tokens (non fungible is in the name) but the hype around them has caused a massive bull run to happen, although I truly believe when the market/if the market starts to tank, NFTs and any other projects that aren’t a long term hold will come crumbling down, but until they decide to stop printing money, I think the value of these currencies will continue to inflate, so let’s enjoy the ride whilst we can! 


For the apes:
$blink is $winks sister token, one is 800m+ market cap the other is $29m market cap, $blink is on a better network, so do some math and you’ll understand why lambo soon

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"Defi on Tron with almost zero gas fees compared to ETH, and the first major audited project","So gas cost on ETH took up most of my profits, thus migrating to tron (TRX) network with fees of 0.03 USDT.

First major project i came across is by [pearl.finance](https://pearl.finance) which build [salmonswap.io](https://salmonswap.io) too. Major token is pearl of 30000 tokens following YFI. (Building vaults now) and they launch salmonswap in which is a LP yield farm, ROI 3000 to 5500% APY currently.

Bought Pearl/TRX and started LP yield farm, moon coming

Update:I now do not think tron will fly because the ecosystem is not matured yet, but i think it has potential will need more months ahead. Thinking back many of its projects has no use case. Not so good after all. Was too bullish earlier.",2,2020-09-07 01:34:39,13

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"🍀 Ferox [$250k market cap]🍀 Rising Star of DeFi on Tron Network, Tremendous Opportunity on Presale, Liquidity & Dividends Locked, ""Be Your Own Hedge Fund""","$FRX (Ferox token) is a 52 days old hidden gem from the recently reinvigorated Tron Network with a state of the art crypto team we built around it.

Around 800 holders now, supply locked at 700 million, the low market cap is steadily increasing, this is as early as you can catch a true #MoonShot candidate before it reaches escape velocity 🚀🚀🚀.

Seed Round sells at a great discount vs the upcoming IDO which is scheduled to launch right after expansion to Binance Smart Chain, a very high probability play exists here for a minimum 12-14x which is frankly a conservative estimate comparing how well even lesser and totally anonymous IDO candidates have recently fared on BSC...

Just to be clear Tron Network has also invested a lot on launchpads recently, and there is a chance the IDO can occur on Tron too, which will lead to even faster price appreciation as FRX is a native TRC20.

Here is the landing page for the Seed Round, **we listened to the community and adjusted all the bonus tiers at a fixed USD amount after the spectacular TRX rally;**

all you need is a Tron wallet that accepts TRC20 tokens to receive $FRX ( like TronLink or Trust Wallet ) 🏆: [**www.feroxadvisors.com/frx**](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx)[ ](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx)🏆

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,$InuCoin next moonshot🚀,"nuCoin🦊 is about to launch!  Strong Community and good price action 💹 Liquidity/Hodl Rewards 💎

$InuCoin is a leading slide DeFi token built to succeed. 
The main purpose behind $Inucoin, is to make the a big memecoin. Only to take you guys up with us!

The roadmap built for $InuCoin is dedicated by market fluctuations.

With a total supply of 1,000,000,000,000,000

On each trx, a tax of 5% will be distributed to the Hodler

and the extra 5% to liquidity 

hence offering holders to hodl and decline the supply time to time.

As the supply decreases, the scarcity of the token increases.

This opposite relationship builts up a supply and demand scenario.

It is further added, there is no limit fixed as to how many tokens can be burnt.

Without a burning limit you know what happens next.

🚀 Transaction network which operate on the Binance smart chain (BSC).

🚀 Will be listed on PancakeSwap.

🚀 Decent total token supply.

🚀 Deflatory system to remove risk of inflation.

🚀 Liquidity available for holders, 5% of each transaction.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,"🍀 Ferox 🍀 [$375k market cap only] [Rising Star of DeFi on Tron] Staking DApp Is Live, Presale Continues with Spectacular Bonus Tiers, ""Be Your Own Hedge Fund""","📷[**IDO/ICO**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/search?q=flair_name%3A%22IDO%2FICO%22&restrict_sr=1)

FRX (Ferox token) is the hidden treasure you've been waiting for from the recently reinvigorated Tron protocol with a state of the art doxxed crypto team built around it.

Paradigm shifting staking model with robust utility based on fiat derivatives trading dividends gives FRX a peerless intrinsic value proposition head and shoulders above the 99% of the meme coin craze going on these days.

Around 1100 holders now, max supply locked at 700 million FRX, the low market cap is steadily increasing, this is as early as you can catch a true MoonShot candidate before it reaches escape velocity 🚀.

Seed Round sells at a great discount vs the upcoming IDO which is scheduled to launch right after expansion to Binance Smart Chain simultaneously on Tron and BSC; a high probability play exists here for a minimum 10-12x which is frankly a conservative estimate comparing how well even anonymous and totally cloned IDO candidates have recently fared on BSC...

Just to be clear Tron Network has also started investing in launchpads recently, and there is a good chance the IDO can occur on Tron too, which will lead to even faster price appreciation as $FRX is a native TRC20.

For our highly risk adverse investors who like to play a safe game, Central Exchange Listings also coming up and shortlisted for July.

Here is the landing page for the Seed Round, we listened to the community and adjusted all the bonus tiers at a fixed USD amount after the powerful TRX rally;

all you need is a Tron wallet that accepts TRC20 tokens to receive FRX ( like TronLink or Trust Wallet ): 🏆 [www.feroxadvisors.com/frx](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx) 🏆

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Why investing into $JM JustMoney is a good investment.,"Blockchain: TRX

Token: Justmoney

Abbreviation: $JM 

Paired liquidity: 
TRX/JM 
USDT/JM 



Website: JustMoney.io 

Their exchange: Justmoney.exchange

Telegram: https://t.me/JustMoneyTRX


Anyone who is familiar with the tron blockchain knows about liquidity bleeding for taxed tokenomics that can be seen on Justswap, Uswap and the likes. 

What JustMoney has done is they have created their own exchange to combat the liquidity bleeding issues that Justswap and Uswap fail to fix (my reasoning why is they make too much money to care)

What this means is that taxed tokens are now actually taxed, the same fix can be used for pancakeswap and poocoin taxed tokenomics that actually break even in their swaps.

The future goals for JustMoney now are to implement crosschain and bridging with BSC and ETH to allow small start up projects from BSC and ETH use the JustMoney exchange. Every project that applies for listing on JustMoney will receive their own embedded code for their Website to support this simple swap.

The current market cap is around $3,000,000

With room to grow, JustMoney could easily see half of or 1:1 with pancakeswaps market cap of just over $5,000,000,000 in time to come. This essentially means that you'll likely see 100x or even 1000x back on your investment in the future.",3,2021-08-23 10:38:11,1

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,$UNIPOWER Bombshell News,"Bombshell new news for **$UNIPOWER**. Here is a calculator, which in coordination with the supply (1M COINS) Will tell you how much it would be worth once supply gets bought up. Already 90 percent of the coins have been bought up and only around 10-15 percent remain. Over 30 percent locked up in staking already also meaning that the coins scarcity is also increasing. This will rocket within the next few coming days/weeks for sure as it is cheap now due to BTC/ETH crash.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,About Bridge Oracle,"About Bridge Oracle

Smart contracts are a kind of application with tamperproof context and clauses which are deployed and executed on blockchain networks. It means that no party (and even creators) are able to manipulate the codes and functions after deployment. Thus unlike traditional paper contracts or digital ones which are programmed on centralized platforms that are exposed to alteration, termination and deletion by a trusted party or a third person, smart contracts bring parties into agreement and generate a novel and powerful class of trust without relying on trust in any party or intermediaries. This feature turns smart contracts into a superior tool for realizing and implementing digital agreement.

  
Bridge Oracle (BRG) are dedicated tokens to the TRON blockchain. The Bridge Oracle system is the first ever dedicated public oracle technology on TRON network. The aim of this token is to create a more affordable payment method for clients to pay for Bridge Oracle services with a significant discount in comparison to pay with TRX. BRG is now listed on Poloniex in our DeFi Innovation Zone.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,TronHero new management fee sharing project,"We are excited to announce our newest project, $TronH. Also known as TronHero, this is a special DeFi project that we plan to offer to the public soon.

TronHero.io is the most popular and secure crowd funding contract running on the TRON blockchain. Our team has acquired more than 16,000,000 TRX in our previous two contracts.

Our management fee is 8% on all deposits into the contract. With our latest project, $TronH, we will redistribute this 8% to all holders. For example, if the contract brings in 100,000,000 TRX, there will be 8,000,000 TRX redistributed to the $TronH holders. Now the more you hold, the more of the fee share you will receive. For example, if you hold 10% of the circulation supply, and there is 8,000,000 TRX to be redistributed, then that investor would receive 800,000 TRX. 

TronHero $TronH Tokenomics 


Total supply: 4,000,000

Pre-sale allocations: 2,500,000 (whatever not sold will be burned)

Uniswap liquidity: 1,000,000 (will be reduced according to what is final Eth cap) 

Development/marketing: 500,000 (will be locked with vested release time every 6 months) 

Pre-sale price: $0.25

Uniswap listing price: $0.40

Marketcap at Listing of circulation supply: $1,000,000

70% of Eth raised going to locked liquidity 

30% of Eth raised going to support TRX balance of TronHero.io contracts to prevent contract drainage. 

There is no soft cap and the hard cap is 520 Ethereum.

Pre-sale is expected to start in a few days on bounce.finance platform. We will have the contract details provided at the time the sale goes live.

TRX,CryptoMoonShots,Unitopia,"Unitopia is owned and operated by TOPIA Network. TOPIA Network is a decentralized application and gaming platform on the TRX Blockchain. Unitopia will bring the birth of a fully licensed multi-chain casino.

UNITOPIA holders will receive a rake equal to 10% of the house edge for EVERY CURRENCY and EVERY GAME offered on the UNITOPIA platform.

The Unitopia Casino is a state-of-the-art multi-currency platform, and with all of the popular games:
Dice, Ring, Crash, Blackjack, Video Poker, Hilo, Slots, Standard Table Games, and Sportsbook.

It also features a revolutionary rewards model that has yet to be seen in the space.

What benefits does this bring to Trontopia and any future onchain platform?

Onchain TOPIA platforms will benefit in multiple ways:

- In the short term, they will be receiving a substantial injection to their reward pools.
- In the long term:
  • Completely revamped UI and user experience. Smoother gameplay, faster speeds, and less reliance on node connectivity for everything to function properly.
  • Access to wide ranges of new games that will be easily offerable onchain as well as offchain. Many providers are easily configurable to work across various methods.
  • Opens the door to a much larger and broad playerbase.
  • Less reliant on TRON success directly.
  • Umbrella ecosystem - The Umbrella is the key component that onchain token holders need to remember. Once TRONTOPIA token has been mined fully, it joins the umbrella. The umbrella receives a share of EVERY topia platform's revenue. This includes Unitopia.

What benefit does Unitopia Token offer?

- UNITOPIA has a very small fixed supply of 1,000,000 Tokens that will EVER be in existence.
- This token will provide access to Rewards from the UNITOPIA Casino Platform that no other token will be able to receive.
- UNITOPIA Casino will have many games with various house edges.
- UNITOPIA Token holders will receive 10% of that house edge for every game, and every currency we offer to be playable.
- These rewards will be automatically exchanged into Ethereum, and airdropped to all uTOPIA holders every week.

How much are they?

0.005 Ethereum per token. Flat rate throughout.

Where does the Ethereum raised go?

The Ethereum Raised will be split into various budgets:

- Liquidity Pool: 20% (50% Ethereum, 50% to purchase uTOPIA, both balances will be added to the Liquidity Pool).
- TOPIA Rewards: 10%
- DIAMOND Rewards: 5%
- UNITOPIA Casino Development & Bankroll: 35%
- Marketing: 10%
- Events (for UNITOPIA Casino Launch): 10%
- Reserves/Unexpected Costs: 10%

Ethereum raised will be distributed in stages as it is raised. Every 20% acquired will be distributed accordingly to the above breakdown. This means the UNITOPIA Liquidity Pool, TOPIA, and Diamond Reward Pools will receive 5 injections throughout the process.

Why expand from TRON?

The current state of the TRX blockchain (Volume, user growth, community) has been in a decline for quite some time, and this has begun to stall progression for the brand.

I've come across a few, including some popular ones like BRC20, the Tron ecosystem rejuvenation, and RWAs. Out of all these, Real-World Assets (RWAs) caught my attention due to their DeFi affiliations and the tokenization of tangible assets.

TRX,Altcoin,The Crypto Listing Paradox: The struggle for all Small Crypto Projects and How to Prevail.,">**The Crypto Listing Paradox: The struggle for all Small Crypto Projects and How to Prevail.**

In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, gaining a listing on a centralized exchange (CEX) can be a pivotal moment for any project, opening doors to liquidity, exposure, and potential growth. However, for small crypto projects, this journey comes with a paradoxical perverse challenge – the Crypto Listing Paradox.

*“The business model of centralized exchanges as we know today, encourages fraud and project failure.”*

CEXs, often regarded as gatekeepers to broader market participation, present a complex set of requirements for projects seeking a listing. While these platforms can significantly boost a project’s credibility, the demands placed on small crypto projects, with a small marketcap, can be financially frightening. Here’s a breakdown of the challenges faced by these projects:

1. **Listing Fees:** CEXs typically require projects to pay substantial listing fees (up to $500.000), acting as a barrier to entry. For smaller projects with limited resources, this initial financial burden can hinder their chances of securing a listing. So CEXs will let those projects pay with their own tokens. After the project gets listed, the tokens are being dumped by the CEX to pay for the fee and the token price plummets. Leaving the crypto community and the project with bags full of sand.
2. **Market Maker:** Beyond listing fees, CEXs may recommend or mandate projects to engage market makers to enhance liquidity. This adds another layer of cost, as market makers often charge fees for their services.
3. **Marketing Campaigns:** To stand out in the competitive crypto landscape, projects are often asked to invest in marketing campaigns like trading competitions. This expenditure, while potentially beneficial for exposure, poses a challenge for projects operating on tight budgets.
4. **Community Engagement:** CEXs expect projects to bring in traders from their own community. This requires active participation and engagement, putting the onus on project teams to foster a vibrant and involved user base. This often results in buying fake followers and pumping fake volume to meet the CEXs requirements.
5. **Volume Maintenance:** Maintaining a high trading volume is crucial for remaining listed on a CEX. Failure to do so can lead to delisting, resulting in the loss of funds invested in the listing process.

The paradox lies in the fact that the only way to avoid paying exorbitant listing fees for listing a token on a CEX is, to already be a sizable project.Which only seem to be achieved by being listed on a CEX. Paying exorbitant listing fees is a risk that always reflects back to the crypto community.This Catch-22 situation creates a perverse challenge for small crypto projects striving to gain visibility, traction **and protecting their community.** These things cannot possibly go together.

However, there is hope. The crypto community plays a vital role in breaking this paradox. Collective action, even in small doses, can significantly impact a project’s trajectory. A few minutes of engagement each day, whether through group messages, tweets, retweets, or comments on influential accounts, can contribute to building the necessary momentum.

While the Crypto Listing Paradox poses a significant hurdle for small crypto projects, community support and active engagement can be powerful tools for overcoming these challenges. By fostering a collaborative spirit within the crypto space, we can help promising projects defy the odds and thrive in the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets.

Justmoney’s decentralized cryptocurrency platform, [just.money 1](https://just.money/) on Polygon, Ethereum, Tron, Binance Chain, and BTTC addresses the Crypto Listing Paradox by providing a cost-effective defi platform. It offers projects an opportunity to list tokens free of charge across multiple blockchains, within a fast growing decentralized crypto ecosystem that goes beyond the limitations of traditional centralized exchanges. Here is how:

1. Projects or tokenholders can provide liquidity that can be redeemed anytime.
2. Providing liquidity the liquidity provider earns 83,30% of the trading fees from the platform.

*For example: the annual interest on the JM/USDT pool on Binance Smart Chain is at the time of writing, over 12%.*

1. The other part of the fee (16,70%) is being used to maintain the platform.
2. The JustMoney Suite for small crypto projects comes with an Automated Market Maker, a Payment Terminal, an Invoicing System and many more tools.
3. All services are free of charge but financed by each transaction.

*“This business model is much more sustainable than current business models of the traditional centralized exchanges.”*

The recent partnership between [TheManeToken 1](https://x.com/TheManeToken?t=tbAdgiS60Fc6WaKg6B70tQ&s=09) and [JustMoney](https://x.com/JustMoneyIO?t=9YHn8Qd2IkC4qij__IePkQ&s=09) can tackle the Crypto Listing Paradox by leveraging Mane Token’s marketing expertise. Mane Token’s strategic campaigns and engaged community can enhance visibility for projects on Justmoney, fostering cross-promotion and addressing B2B needs. With Justmoney’s presence on multiple blockchains, the collaboration aims for sustained ecosystem growth, offering a decentralized and sustainable alternative to traditional exchange listings and marketing campaigns.

TRX,Altcoin,Buy and Hold 100 Cryptocurrencies for 5 years - Week 5 - $2553 gained,"It’s the 5th week since the experiment has started and a lot has been happening, I actually wonder to know if during the 5 years of the experiment there is going to be a quiet week.
The crypto world has been bombarded by FUD, first with China banning the miners, then with South Korean ban on the exchanges, all this caused the price of Bitcoin (BTC) to go as low as $13,105.90 USD. As if it wasn’t enough, Warren Buffet said that “Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies will come to a bad end”. All these caused also the altcoins price to go on a rollercoaster, but today seems like most of them are bouncing back.
To go into details about the experiment, the overall gain is $2533 USD (253%) or 0.19 BTC.
Only 10 Cryptocurrencies are in minus since the beginning of the experiment and 3 of them have reached a gain of over 1000 %.
Let’s talk about our Top5 cryptocurrencies.
Tron (TRX) is also for this week the best gainer. Five weeks ago I bought 2500 TRX with $10.04.  2500 TRX are worth now $275.48, a gain of 2644.83 %
Justin Sun, founder of Tron. Announced this week a new cooperation with Bao Feng, and been teasing about a cooperation with an innovative space company.
Verge (XVG) finally released to so waited Wraith protocol. The price has been stable and 1 XVG is now worth $0.15 , I first bought it 5 weeks ago at $0.0079.
Vechain (VEN) is the first new entry on the Top5,  looking at the chart it has been rising for over one month. In fact, when I bought it 5 weeks ago, I got with $10.11 , 18 (VEN), at the time the price was of $ 0.56 , right now the price is $6.24, so the 18 VEN is now worth $112.48 a major gain of 1012.14 %.
The other new entry on the Top5, sitting at the 4th position is Binance Coin (BNB), it’s been a while since BNB has been performing well, not sure about the exact reason, but it could be connected by the fact that Binance volume keeps growing massively. BNB can be used as trading fee option on Binance, doing so it lowers the trading fees from 0.1 % to 0.05%.
Binace volume has been that high that they could barely keep up and had to halt a few time the sign up of new users. From a recent tweet, they announced that they got over 5 Million users!
Ripple (XRP) is having again a big momentum, yesterday MoneyGram signed a deal with them announcing that it will use it to speed up their transitions. I believe this is one of the biggest wins for Ripple so far.
Top 5 cryptocurrencies so far :
Tron (TRX)  +2644.83 % , from $10.04 to $275.48
Verge (XVG)  +1794.52 % , from $9.62 to $182.25
VeChain (VEN) +1012.14 % , from 10.11  to $112.48
Binance Coin (BNB) +914.17 % , from $9.99 to $99.48
Ripple (XRP)  +837.01 % , from $9.75 to $91.34

I'm quite new to crypto and was wondering how many different coins people recommend to hold?

I currently have:

Ethereum
BNB
Algorand
Tron
Harmony one
BTT
Banano

The first 5 are my main holdings whilst the last two are my ""lottery tickets"". The problem is that the more I read the more different coins I want. I don't want to spread myself too thin though. 

What does everything think?is this a good number/selection to hold? I know no-one can tell me which will be successful but would like a little reassurance that I haven't made totally terrible choices. Is this too many/few?

TRX,Altcoin,Buy and Hold 100 Crypto for 5 Years - Week 21 - 1153 USD / 115.3 % gain,"After a long break due to work, I’m back to write a bit update.
It’s been 21 weeks since I started the experiment. Since then a lot has been going on and I’m glad to see that I’m still gaining $1153 and 0.12 BTC.

The price of Bitcoin is currently at $ 9831, showing a bit gain since the bearish phase going on since March. Is this the beginning of a Bull Run?
The dominance of BTC is at 36% and the Market Cap at 465 Billion, definitely showing a good come back of the cryptos in general.
A nice thing to notice about the experiment is that so far only 29 cryptos are in minus, which means that the (CryptoETF100) is performing way better than a single crypto. Also, the gain in BTC is at 0.12 BTC, more than double of what I originally invested.
 
Let’s talk about our Top3 cryptocurrencies.

With an impressive gain of 2090.56 %  Tron (TRX) is the overall winner. The $10.04 originally invested are worth now $219.86, not sure if there is another crypto that performed this well lately! With the almost imminent lunch of the Main Net I’m sure this is going to be a fun ride! 😉

The second overall gainer is Verge (XVG) a crypto with a massive community, one of the biggest in the crypto world. Even with a lot of controversy XVG is still performing really well. With a gain of 916.09$ n the experiment this is definitely a coin that is making the difference!

Lastly Vechain (VEN), I’m sure many of you have heard about it and to be honest I’m not impressed by the gains. VEN is believed to be one of the most promising projects. The 18 VEN I bought 21 weeks ago with $10.11 is now worth $98.75, big gain true, but I’m very positive about a bigger gain, especially with the lunch of the Main Net with Masternodes at the end June!

**The metaverse is everywhere**

It seems that the crypto community is way ahead of the curve. Nothing new there. Facebook announced that they had changed their name to Meta to reflect their focus on the metaverse. Whilst blockchain entrepreneurs have been developing metaverse applications for a few years now Facebook gave it mainstream recognition. Before that announcement the average person hadn't even heard of the metaverse and if they had they didn't have a clue what it meant.

Here is a brief definition for those in the metaverse beginner camp:

A shared, realistic, and immersive computer simulation of the real world or other possible worlds, in which people participate as digital avatars.

Investors are piling into cryptocurrencies which have even a faint connection to the metaverse. 

The top 5 cryptos in the metaverse space are:

Axie Infinity $7.0bn

Decentraland $5.0bn

The Sandbox $5.1bn

Enjin Coin $2.9bn

Illuvium $0.8bn

A few long shots worth a closer look:

Somnium $0.2bn

Rentible $7m

The metaverse is an interesting concept to investigate, from an investors point of view anyway. There are two plays. The first is investing in the cryptocurrency and the second is buying land. Let’s take Decentraland for instance. Its fully diluted market cap of $10 billion is priced to perfection. In other words, the valuation already assumes they will be a leading player in this market going forward. And that thinking is also priced into the value of their virtual land which is selling for up to millions of dollars. 

Virtual land is like real estate. It is in finite supply with location playing an important role in its value. Canny investors are buying up virtual land plots on various metaverses expecting to either develop it, rent it or flip it.

The metaverse is set to be part of our future. However, a few words of warning. Don't go rushing out to buy the next shiny metaverse project. 99.9% of the new projects coming to market will fail. Also remember, buying virtual land comes with risk. Like buying land in the real world, if you purchase a plot within a metaverse where there are few visitors your land will have as much value as buying land in the middle of the Sahara. 

**dYdX and the perpetual**

Let’s start with, what is a perpetual?

A perpetual swap is something similar to a futures contract. The core difference is that perpetuals do not have expiration dates. 

dYdX’s perpetuals have proved so popular that they have eclipsed Coinbase in daily volumes. It achieved this by solely offering perpetual for four assets. dYdX is now one of the most liquid exchanges in crypto.

**Rapid fire**

The influential FATF (Financial Action Task Force) **wants governments to hold the people behind DeFi protocols accountable**. This will send the shivers down the backs of the many platforms that have decided on anonymity. This proposal is not likely to come in for some time, but it is something that we can see being implemented and enforced ruthlessly.

Muslim leaders have warned their flock that **crypto is forbidden**. According to these well-informed individuals, ‘it has elements of uncertainty, wagering, and harm’.

Binance CEO announced that he intends to **give away up to 99% of his wealth**. No doubt this raised the eyebrows of US authorities who will be eyeing much of his wealth for themselves!

Binance made **Know Your Customer (KYC) mandatory** for global users in their effort to make Binance a regulatory compliant business. 

In another attack on the DeFi space. BlockFi, which offers high interest rates to investors, is being **investigated by the SEC**. The SEC considers that BlockFi’s interest accounts represent the offering of unregistered securities, something that no doubt the SEC will use to target many other high profile yield farming platforms in the near future.

Cardano the blockchain platform has **achieved over 20 million transactions worth over $18 billion**. That figure is only slightly lower than that of Bitcoin and compares to Ethereum’s $9 billion. The price of ADA however is in the doldrums with many complaining of the lack of DAPPs because of its complex programming language. 

eToro announced it was **delisting Cardano and TRON** by the end of the year for US customers as it believes these coins could represent securities.

Each week we provide the latest APRs from leading staking and yield farming platforms together with news from the industry.

Staking and yield farming has been a major driver in the huge growth in the DeFi sector. Investors are being enticed by the massive APRs on offer. Totally new projects tempting investors with returns of 10,000+ % are able to attract a deluge of money from investors who don’t seem concerned with the high risks involved. Our weekly review looks at the best platforms out there and the ones to avoid. We attempt to weed out the platforms that we think won’t stand the test of time.

**Catchy by name Catchy by nature**

A tracker wallet that has to be tried to be appreciated!

Tired of manually adding token addresses to Trustwallet? Tired of seeing out-of-date and inaccurate balances? Tired of switching apps to check on your multiple wallets? We present CATCHY, an innovative solution that facilitates wallet tracking, implemented directly on Telegram, the flagship crypto platform. CATCHY aims to provide a suite of crypto tracking tools for Telegram users. From the currently available multichain (BSC + ETH) Telegram wallet tracker, to the upcoming whale watcher, price alert, and sniper bot tools, our vision is to create an ecosystem that satisfies all crypto enthusiast needs. Today, we’ll give a small overview of our multi chain wallet tracker and the many useful features it has to offer.

Our Telegram wallet tracker is made with both accessibility and convenience in mind. Simply talk to one of our tracker bots (found in our Telegram group [CATCHYTOKEN](https://t.me/CATCHYTOKEN)), and it will direct you to the tracker bot you were specifically assigned to. From there on out, you’ll only use one command: /wallet. On your first use, the bot will notify you that you haven’t added any wallet addresses to the tracker and will ask you about the blockchain you wish to use. Keep in mind that you can add up to 3 wallets at any time, and they can belong to different blockchains, so your choice here isn’t final. Reply to the tracker bot’s message with a wallet address of your choosing, and you’re good to go! 

Note that the tracker DOES NOT require a wallet connection, making it the absolute safest option to keep tabs on your balances. The tracker can never be linked back to your person either, as it relies on an anonymous numerical ID that is unique to each individual. The bot you were assigned to will remember you through that ID, so you’ll never have to go through the setup process again.

After you’re done with the first step, the tracker will immediately attempt to fetch your wallet balances based on publicly available data. Just wait a couple seconds and VOILA: the balance of every token in your wallet, valued in USD and BNB/ETH (depending on the chain), ranked by value. These values are the most up-to-date balances you can fetch, as they rely on the BSC and ETH blockchains directly instead of waiting for other services to supply prices (like Trustwallet for example). From this point onwards, you’ll rarely ever need to use /wallet again, as the buttons supplied under your balance sheet are more than enough to satisfy any needs you might have. 

The \[Refresh\] button immediately updates your balances, the \[Gains\] button enables percentage gain calculation from the last time you pressed \[Refresh\], the \[MC\] button adds the market cap of every token directly into the balance sheet, and the \[Charts\] button offers immediate access to the charts of your tokens. The \[Manage\] button allows you to add wallets (up to 3) or remove existing ones, as well as play around with language settings (English and Chinese are available at the moment). 

At CATCHY, your convenience is our utmost priority, and we hope that is reflected in the intuitive design of our tracker and its ease of use. However, our most convenient feature is one that you’ll rarely ever notice: Scam/Dead token filtering. Unlike sites like poocoin, where you have to manually hide dust and dead tokens, our tracker automatically does that for you by employing our own filtering system. And if our system oversteps its boundaries, you can use the \[Show Missing & Hide Existing Tokens\] button to take full control of your tracker’s output. These choices will be saved forever, so you’ll never have to reconfigure your balance sheet. 

Our tracker strikes a delicate balance between convenience and complexity, offering you extensive control of what you see without sacrificing simplicity and accessibility. The tracker is currently free for users to try and explore, but in the near future, you will have to hold CATCHY to make use of its features, making it the first of many use cases that are coming down the line. Please visit our website https://catchy.finance/ for further details on the tracker and other products currently in the works.

TRX,Altcoin,Anyone have any good feelings about a specific Altcoin?,"I have already invested in a few altcoins. Some I’ve bought are cpc, eos, tnb, and med token. I was wondering, does anyone have any altcoins they recommend I check out or any they have a good feeling about the futures of. If you could also say why, that would be great. I’m hoping to learn more about some others with promising futures that I can decided whether I want to invest in or not. Thanks! ",13,2018-04-04 04:09:40,30
TRX,Altcoin,Have $500 left to Invest,"Started with $1200, and spent 700 on acquiring XRP, XML, DENT, TRX, ADT, . Bought NXT @ $2, so that didn't pan out for me at all, and to round it out since I didn't have a lot of money to invest I bought a few ENG, QASH and WABI. Also invested in longer hodls hoping to moon I invested into MoonCoin, Reddcoin, XP, DOGE and KIN. All this based on reading recommendations on reddit for the past 2 weeks and researching the coins. So any recommendations will be appreciated along with why you would recommend the coin, as I have come across some coins that I felt had no real purpose then to make money for people invested in it from the beginning. Wish I had more money to invest since the beginning but such is life of a student. Also Coinbase wait times are horrible right now so I have time to research some more coins.",12,2018-01-04 07:46:16,26
TRX,Altcoin,"The crypto world is still so tiny little that it is so easy to manipulate with fake news and fuds. It happens all the time & even with big coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple.",,65,2018-02-07 08:39:35,17
TRX,Altcoin,Enigma is the most promising blockchain project I've seen,"The problem? It's confusing to quickly understand what they are attempting to accomplish (e.g. Catalyst vs. Enigma protocol). After reading the whitepaper, all the blog posts, and watching videos with the team, I believe the Enigma protocol should be valued comparably to the other top legitimate projects today (ETH, Cardano, Stellar, NEO).

1) Team - The Enigma team is perhaps the most qualified team in crypto. MIT Media Lab has been at the forefront of blockchain since the beginning, and innovation in general. In addition to MIT pedigrees, they have real, tenured backgrounds in development and distributed systems - it truly amazes me how many projects have generated higher market cap with zero credibility in distributed systems (let alone non-development backgrounds...).

2) Protocol ambition - unless you do the research, it's easy to miss what they are trying to accomplish. The most recent blog post outlines potential real-world use cases in six large industries, each $50B+. To help understand, I've pulled out passages from select blog posts:

""This is an ambitious vision that rivals the scale of large projects like Ethereum and Filecoin while complementing their functionality. In addition to our data protocol, we are building products (such as Catalyst) that will democratize the tools for interacting with and consuming data.""

""[The Enigma protocol] aspires to complement a blockchain (of any kind) with an off-chain data network (essentially — a single, always-on decentralized database), in much the same way that payment networks (e.g., Raiden) offer better financial transactions scalability. Essential to the Enigma network is the ENG token

""We hope this explains the reasoning behind our naming. Enigma was, and still is the name given to the decentralized data marketplace protocol. It is also the name of the company behind it. Catalyst is the first application to encourage adoption of a decentralized protocol that we hope would one day hold the long-tail of data on the web. As the name suggests, Catalyst is meant to speed up the adoption of this protocol.""

""We are facing the opportunity to completely reshape dozens of industries, each with tens or hundreds of billions of dollars of unlockable value, if we can solve the two major issues of blockchains: scalability and privacy.""

3) A functioning product - Catalyst is the first product example and already available for use. Catalyst is only the beginning and I believe pales in comparison to broader Enigma protocol use cases, but it serves as a proof of concept and a proof point that the team is legitimate and can deliver. Many other larger market cap projects have nothing beyond a whitepaper.

4) Incredibly undervalued - a 30x return may sound high, but that would result in a ~$12B USD market cap today (less than Cardano / Stellar / Tron - honestly not unreasonable ignoring marketing / hype and based on project merit alone).

Decentralization is the future, but most crypto projects today are held up by irrational market exuberance alone and will ultimately fail. The Enigma protocol has the ability to become the backbone of our decentralized world.


Disclaimer: I have invested significantly in ENG at various times from $0.60 USD and most recently during this dip. I will continue to buy until this project is valued appropriately (greater than $10B USD at today's valuations - higher as the broader non-BTC market rises this year). I have no intention to sell until then.",22,2018-01-05 14:12:26,21

TRX,Altcoin,Need help choosing an exchange (beginner),"Hi everyone I am completely new to altcoins. I have yet to buy some (besides some litecoin). I was just needing a little help on deciding which exchange to use because i heard you can keep your coins in their exchange wallet.

These are the coins i am interested in:

Power Ledger (POWR)
TenX(PAY)
Substratum (SUB)
VeChain (VEN)
IOTA (IOTA)
Request Network(REQ)
TRON (TRX)

These are the exchanges i have considered: 

Bittrex
Binance
Liqui.io
Poloniex

So you are probably wondering whats holding me back. I dont know what exchange to go with or if it even makes that much of a difference. i dont want to have to go to different exchanges to buy/sell 1 altcoin. I want to be able to go to one place. ""So why dont you just go see which exchange has all those coins and pick that one?""....Well i dont know what exchanges are good or how they compare to each other. basically i need some guidance from people more experienced to get me headed in the right direction, thats why i posted this.

Also whats the difference between (for example) IOTA/BTC and IOTA/ETH? Does it have to do with the market they're in?

Thank you :)",8,2017-12-09 06:51:52,21
TRX,Altcoin,"Most talked about and upvoted cryptos and altcoins on reddit, week ending 2018-01-26","What a crazy few weeks it’s been! Things are picking back up in the markets, so hold on tight.

Reddit started shilling Raiblocks, Vechain, and Icon in early-mid December, and those cryptos went on to increase 500%+ in the next month. So I wrote a program that scrapes reddit posts from r/cryptocurrency and r/altcoin, and calculates the post count and total post score (net upvotes for all posts) for posts that mention each cryptocurrency, to help give an early indication of the next potential 10x crypto. 10x is of course highly optimistic, but understanding crowd sentiment has proven to be a good place to start for deeper research.

**Note**: *always* do your own research. Not all cryptos with a lot of mentions are being talked about for good/positive reasons (e.g. BitConnect).

Here are some of the numbers for this week (if you prefer to follow along via email, [you can do so here](https://cryptomintclub.com)).


**RECENTLY TRENDING CRYPTOS**


**Highlights:**

1. **WaltonChain** was one of the largest gainers in price this past week, even though the volume of buzz remained steady.

2. **ECC**, **AChain**, and **XTRABYTES** are lower market cap coins that have appeared on the top talked about cryptos list.

3. **Stellar**, even at a 11B market cap, was one of the few cryptos to experience a net gain in price this past week. The amount of buzz, both in terms of number of posts and total score for those posts, has been increasing.

TRX,Altcoin,Why You Should Be Staking That $BET bag right now.,"$BET is the native token for [Earnbet](https://luck.earnbet.io) Casino, the Original Decentralised Casino.

Built on the WAX Blockchain, it's the first Crypto Casino to go fully decentralised, offering players provably fair and verifiable games as well as full custody of their private keys.

Here's where it goes even better than the rest.
Apart from enjoying Chainlink Oracle Integration, which is a significant passmark, the Casino shares its entire profits from wagers made in Bitcoin & Ethereum to $BET hodlers who have their bags staked on the Casino. Profits from wagers made in other altcoins are used by the Casino to buy back $BET in the open market.
In other words, Hodlers who stake their bags get to claim dividends every month from player activity on the casino. 

So far since inception in 2018, over $9m in dividends have been paid so far.

$BET holders also enjoy Governance rights thereby defining the policy direction of the Casino.
With the coming Sports Betting features coming on the Casino soon, there's been a scramble for $BET by discerning crypto enthusiasts as that means more Bitcoin and Ethereum profits to share as betting volumes rise across board.

From a meagre price of $0.01+ in October 2020, $BET has hit $0.13 in mid February 2021 climbing slowly with sustained momentum. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/earnbet/

It will interest you to note that $BET tokens has over 80% of its circulating supply already staked for dividends with a significant value staked long term.

$BET can be purchased on Uniswap, BinanceDEX & HotBit.

https://uniswap.info/token/0xfdd4e938bb067280a52ac4e02aaf1502cc882ba6

Players also earn $BET tokens for each wager placed on the Casino tables.

PS: Get a $50 BTC Bonus on First Deposit. Earnbet accepts deposits in 14 major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, EOS, XRP, BNB, BCH, LINK, LTC & USDT.

There's also an ongoing $2,000 $LINK Giveaway for the Top 50 Players on the Casino's Leaderboard this week. Promo closes on 4/20/2021 12:00 UTC .",5,2021-04-10 21:06:57,1
TRX,Altcoin,AIX - very promising if potential is realized. Opinions?,"What are people's thoughts on AIX here? Would like some feedback before looking into making any moves. This one seems very promising and solid, yet is under the radar in the crypto-world. If potential is realized than huge returns could be gained by investing now. It's basically bringing insurance to IoT devices and they have already have a product out. Seeing cryptos like cardano and Tron - who may also have a great idea, but nothing other than a whitepaper and long winded roadmap surprises me here. Not to mention, unlike them AIX has an extremely low circulating supply, so the price should be quite big if it gets popular. It's on Kucoin atm, should it reach binance I can see this thing going through the roof for those who get involved now. It's listed on cmc also, but because market cap isn't calculated, it's missing from top 100-200. I'm not shilling it - after all I've not even put my money on it. I'd really like to know what redditors think because I've browsed around and listened to some opinions on here and 70ish % of the time they actually pay off. Planning to put around 20% of my portfolio into a coin that's not yet took off. ",38,2018-01-13 08:07:25,12
TRX,Altcoin,"Most talked about and upvoted cryptos in r/altcoin and r/cryptocurrency, week ending 2018-01-19","tl;dr: (skip to “Trending Cryptos”, esp. if you've already read the intro from my post last week)

**INTRO**

Like most of us here, I’ve been following the posts on this subreddit diligently, and have been able to make some good crypto investments from all the shilling, discussion, and even fud that happens here!

I don’t have enough time to read everything and constantly check the reddit app, but I still don’t want to miss out on opportunities that come from a crypto being talked a lot about on here.

So I developed a program for myself that collects data on the cryptos that are being talked about most (both in terms of number of posts, and total number of upvotes) on r/cryptocurrency and r/altcoin. I can quickly browse the headlines of the top posts it collects, as well as see at a glance which cryptos are “trending” or “buzzing” on the subreddits in the recent weeks. The program also pulls in Coinmarketcap API data, like current market cap and 7 day price change. Aggregating all this data automatically has saved me a lot of time and allowed me to focus my research efforts on the cryptos that I think could have the highest potential e.g. low market cap, recently “buzzing” cryptos on r/cryptocurrency and r/altcoin.

I’ve decided to share the outputs of my program, as well as some highlights I’ve written, here for the benefit of this subreddit (and may do so periodically). Let me know if you have any feedback, questions, or suggestions, always looking to improve and share more interesting data here!

**TRENDING CRYPTOS**

**Highlights:**

1. **BitConnect** lost almost all its value this past week, with a large increase in the number of posts, and the popularity of those posts, about it. BitConnect's increase in buzz is almost entirely attributable to the community pouncing on it for being a scam / pyramid scheme.
2. **COSS** and **Aigang** were lower market cap coins that fell in price, but experienced a modest increase in buzz. Some continue to remain optimistic about the prospects of COSS, and there have been several posts reviewing Aigang as more and more people learn about it.
3. **NEO** was the only coin to have an increase in price this past week. Buzz for NEO is still remaining steady, at the top of the list in terms of both post count and score/popularity.

(inf means infinity, which occurs when a number is divided by zero i.e. a week over week change number is calculated when the week before last week had a zero value)

TRX,Altcoin,What is the best wallet for altcoins? Is there a universal wallet?,"I'm looking for a safe and diverse altcoins wallet, preferably a cloud based wallet like litevault. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! (Ripple,tron,iota,etc.)",8,2018-02-17 04:53:08,11
TRX,Altcoin,Data from the top 20 fastest growing communities in crypto over the last month,"Hey everyone, for the past couple months I have been working on a project called [Coinmunity](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinmunity-bitcoin-altcoin-app/id1322869245?mt=8). Coinmunity is an app that focuses on the growth of crypto communities, which in the market right now, has so much effect in driving price changes. Each day it tracks which coins have the combined highest % of growth in their Twitter and Reddit communities combined.

&nbsp;

Today, Coinmunity has now been live for one month, so I thought I would share what patterns I have personally picked out, having worked on the data, and observing the rankings during development and while live.

&nbsp;

What I have noticed is that you will see certain coins start to creep up higher and higher into the top 10 or 15 communities consistently before a price increase. The best example is TRX. You can see from this reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7k2c4g/congrats_rtronix_you_were_the_top_growing/) that I made 27 days ago, that /r/Tron had the top community while it was still at $.01 ( and it continues to consistently be in top 10 even now.) I think most of us can agree TRX has some big issues, but the point is that it’s very important to know which coins have the most eyes on them; because when people are watching a coin, they’ll usually buy it.

&nbsp;

**Here are the 20 coins with the most growth in their communities in the last 30 days:**

[#1 TRX](/r/Tronix) -  **Price Change:** +2664.018%, **Total Social Change:**+3904.851%

[#2 VEN](/r/Vechain) - **Price Change:** +709.507%, **Total Social Change:**+974.497%

[#3 XVG](/r/VergeCurrency) - **Price Change:** +2005.76%, **Total Social Change:**+925.614%

[#4 ADA](/r/Cardano) - **Price Change:** +467.414%, **Total Social Change:**+714.406%

[#5 FUN](/r/FunFairTech) - **Price Change:** +366.608%, **Total Social Change:**+611.430%

[#6 REQ](/r/RequestNetwork) - **Price Change:** +646.897%, **Total Social Change:**+607.782%

[#7 BNB](/r/Binance) - **Price Change:** +546.153%, **Total Social Change:**+ 558.920%

[#8 SUB](/r/SubstratumNetwork) - **Price Change:** +619.376%, **Total Social Change:**+501.659%

[#9 XLM](/r/Stellar) - **Price Change:** +249.216%, **Total Social Change:**+501.642%

[#10 ARN](/r/AeronAero) - **Price Change:** +1020.204%, **Total Social Change:**+469.129%

[#11 ENG](/r/EnigmaCatalyst) - **Price Change:** +1162.809%, **Total Social Change:**+427.344%

[#12 MANA](/r/Dencentraland) - **Price Change:** +236.856%, **Total Social Change:**+393.404%

[#13 XRP](/r/Ripple) - **Price Change:** +812.067%, **Total Social Change:**+389.193%

[#14 ETN](/r/Electroneum) - **Price Change:** +60.470%, **Total Social Change:**+366.755%

[#15 QSP](/r/Quantstamp) - **Price Change:** +518.553%, **Total Social Change:**+346.401%

[#16 SALT](/r/SaltTrader) - **Price Change:** +76.836%, **Total Social Change:**+331.701%

[#17 AST](/r/AirSwap) **Price Change:** +561.384%, **Total Social Change:**+272.433%

[#18 THC](/r/TheHempCoin) - **Price Change:** +711.952%, **Total Social Change:**+265.797%

[#19 NULS](/r/NulsService) - **Price Change:** +587.179%, **Total Social Change:**+234.036%

[#20 QASH](/r/LiquidQash) - **Price Change:** +104.2105%, **Total Social Change:**+208.4238%

*Total social change => reddit and twitter growth

&nbsp;

It probably wouldn’t be the best decision to buy a coin based off just community growth, so Coinmunity pulls each coin’s full subreddit to make it easy to quickly research the coin and see if there is any upcoming big news. 

&nbsp;

**Some upcoming features that we think will add value:**

* Google trends

* Marketcap and volume rankings

* Track personal investments

&nbsp;

If you have an android, the app is currently in development, but I have made a mobile friendly web app that is available at https://coinmunity.co! I will announce on the Coinmunity [twitter](https://twitter.com/coinmunityapp) when it is completed.

&nbsp;

As Coinmunity continues to grow, I will start to collect more and more data on social activity surrounding these coins, such as retweets,comments, upvotes, etc. One relationship that I am looking forward to explore is the amount of exchanges a coin is available on vs social growth vs price growth. I think there is a sweet-spot before a coin is widely enough available to experience huge price jumps, where it would be the best time to buy a coin. If this is something you guys are interested in please let me know and I will continue to post each month about further discoveries from the data!

TRX,Altcoin,Pros / Cons of BNB?,"Hey guys. I only just came across BNB and wanted to get your thoughts. After having a read of the Binance coin whitepaper, it seems like they're a steal at the current price. However, knowing my past history with crypto, I could be very wrong. 

Here is what I like about BNB: 

1. Strong team - Changpeng Zhao is a bloody boss. He did roughly $5 million in revenue his first year with his new company that provides cloud-based services to exchanges. Check out his Linkedin if you get the chance. 

2. Interesting business model - From the 27th, they're offering 50% off TX fees if you use BNB pay for the transaction. This will most certaintly encourage users to hold BNB and trade more and more on Binance.

3. ICO Platform - They are building a vehicle for new coins to ICO (such as Tron) and may down the line offer discounts to BNB holders.  

4. Mission driven - They want to be the NSDQ of China, which isn't a simple feat, but speaks to the longevity of their vision. 

5. Customer Service - If you join their Slack channel (binance.slack.com), you'll find CZ (the CEO) frequent the chat. He's doing everything he can to add value and utility to the coin, which is more than I can say about 99% of the coins out there. 

That's just my 2c... I would like to know mostly about why it's not a good investment. If anyone could enlighten me, please do...thanks.

TRX,Altcoin,Looking for binance investment suggestions,"Just had another $100 deposit of LTC into coinbase clear that I want to invest into an alt on binance. I have about of all my crypto in LTC, XRP and XLM, about 1/3 each. Looking for something that is cheaper with lots of room to grow on a long term hodl, 6 months-2 years 

Edit: something that is ledger nano compatible is preferred!",0,2018-01-08 19:30:38,8

TRX,Altcoin,Digitex - World's First Decentralized Futures Exchange ICO Launch,"Came across this upcoming ICO. It's called Digitex and it's a new futures exchange that will do BTC/ETH/LTC to USD. Best of all, they are operating with zero fees. They pay for the fees by creating tokens, but the token holders determine how many new tokens are created to cover the fees for each year. 

Decentralized exchange . Account balances of traders will be held by a decentralized, independent smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, not by the exchange.

Zero trading fees.

Traders need DGTX tokens to trade. So they will be much more in demand than KCS and BNB.

1,000,000,000 initial supply, which is 1/100 of Tron(TRX) supply. Price per token $0.01

Built using the Elixir programming language and partners with 'Plataformatec', a software company founded by Jose Valim, the creator of the Elixir language.

The team consists of the developer and also the owner of a successful UK trading platform (Betfair Sports Trading Software for Mac & PC from RacingTraders https://racingtraders.co.uk/ ) which has been in existence for some years (see their twitter https://twitter.com/racingtraders or google them). Other team members are experienced too.

Sign up using just your email and you receive 1000 DGTX tokens for free each time when someone signs up using your referral link. Do it before Jan 15 , when token sale starts. 1 DGTX is $0.01 as of now. Additional 1000 DGTX to you if that someone also refers friends. Still additionally you get 30% of the ETH your friends spend in the DGTX token sale. You get them after Jan 15.

Please use my referral if you found this post useful: https://vrlps.co/a?pt=24egHeF-mYgN9sCzFHAbpvZzKrw&referralCode=r18dziCmG&refSource=copy

Podcast with the CEO: https://juicestorm.com/podcast/307-digitex-futures-exchange-adam-todd/

About him: https://racingtraders.co.uk/about/adam-todd.html

FYI - The team is vested for a year before they can sell any of their tokens.

TRX,Altcoin,Best Altcoins 2018,"HI Everyone, these are my altcoins for 2018. Curious on people's opinions:

CND Cindicator
TRX Tron
XLM Stellar Lumens
BRD Bread
ADA Cardano
IOTA MIOTA
SUB Substratum
XRP Ripple
BQX Ethos
AION AION

Question is which types of blockchain companies have the most upside for 2018. I am guessing companies that help make cryptocurrencies accessible to the general public ETHOS, BRD. Curious on people's thoughts.",6,2018-01-04 10:23:16,6
TRX,Altcoin,Where do you keep your altcoins for long term holding?,"I have tons of coins tbh. Bitcoin,  etherum, ripple, verge, cardano, stellar, simple token, electroneum, ember coin, reddcoin, tron, dent, po.et, and dentacoin. I have a nano s ledger but I know it probably only holds 3 or 4 of those. Can anybody help me? Most of my mains are on coinbase but my altcoins are just sitting on exchanges. Even with the 2 factor authentication It doesn't feel that safe just leaving stuff on the exchange. If anybody could help would appreciate it greatly just trying to keep my investments safe.",4,2017-12-28 17:29:58,6
TRX,Altcoin,Anything to hodl me over?,I'm hodling tron til it goes back up but I bought in at 0.03 and 0.15. I see people talking about 0.002 and I'm so rattled. Just got into Crypto after a talk with my uncle over Xmas. Are there any other coins to invest in that are doing well this early ? Or are there any good sites or sources to research the coins that early? Thanks,2,2018-01-14 18:11:11,6
TRX,Altcoin,Where to buy altcoins and ico coins?,"I’m currently using a couple different exchanges to buy my altcoins, but the variety is fairly limited. Where are you supposed to buy new coins from icos and coins like Tron and such?

Also, where is a safe place to keep the altcoins? My Ledger won’t hold them until new applications are made. Thanks in advance!",2,2017-12-08 15:29:33,6
TRX,Altcoin,i need some quick tips for a noobie about them altcoins :D,"Hey all, I have just started with cryptocurrencies and so far i have bought some bitcoin and litecoin for holding or hodl like u guys say :). I use i bought them at coinbase just because it was the simple way. But my plan is to use them on other sites like GDAX, Binance, Cryptopia, These are the sites i have a account atm. so far so good. But now i want to have some altcoins and it seems so hard to get them. I use JAXX for my wallet but it can not store the altcoins i want. Do u guys have like 5 different wallets or how do u do it? Also Coinbase take a very big fee just to transfer my BTC. And what i can see you have to buy ur altcoins with btc, ltc and so on. 

So what i really want to know is there an easier way to buy altcoins like directly from euro? 
Where should i store my altcoins? also for the really small coins like Embercoin, shield, verge, tron.
is coinbase the easiest place to buy for euro? and then i have to pay the fee to transfer them to cryptopia,binance and so on? 
Do you have any tips for me as im new to this i have watched alot of videos and done my research but its a big new world :D


Thank you for the answers and i appreciate all help i can get, I hope i make sence.",2,2018-01-07 16:09:25,5
TRX,Altcoin,So what are you guys buying low?,"I was looking at Tron, Vechain, Iota, Elixir, and Nuls.",3,2017-12-08 01:24:27,5

TRX,Altcoin,Digitex - World's First Decentralized Futures Exchange ICO Launch - 1000 free tokens,"Came across this upcoming ICO. It's called Digitex and it's a new futures exchange that will do BTC/ETH/LTC to USD. Best of all, they are operating with zero fees. They pay for the fees by creating tokens, but the token holders determine how many new tokens are created to cover the fees for each year. Decentralized exchange . Account balances of traders will be held by a decentralized, independent smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, not by the exchange. Zero trading fees. Traders need DGTX tokens to trade. So they will be much more in demand than KCS and BNB. 1,000,000,000 initial supply, which is 1/100 of Tron(TRX) supply. Price per token $0.01 Built using the Elixir programming language and partners with 'Plataformatec', a software company founded by Jose Valim, the creator of the Elixir language. The team consists of the developer and also the owner of a successful UK trading platform (Betfair Sports Trading Software for Mac & PC from RacingTraders https://racingtraders.co.uk/ ) which has been in existence for some years (see their twitter https://twitter.com/racingtraders or google them). Other team members are experienced too. Sign up using just your email and you receive 1000 DGTX tokens for free each time when someone signs up using your referral link. Do it before Jan 15 , when token sale starts. 1 DGTX is $0.01 as of now. Additional 1000 DGTX to you if that someone also refers friends. Still additionally you get 30% of the ETH your friends spend in the DGTX token sale. You get them after Jan 15. Please use my referral if you found this post useful: https://vrlps.co/a?pt=24egHeF-mYgN9sCzFHAbpvZzKrw&referralCode=Sy6sr_1Vz&refSource=copy Podcast with the CEO: https://juicestorm.com/podcast/307-digitex-futures-exchange-adam-todd/ About him: https://racingtraders.co.uk/about/adam-todd.html FYI - The team is vested for a year before they can sell any of their tokens.",7,2018-01-07 03:01:35,3

TRX,Altcoin,How to store ERC20 tokens on myetherwallet?,"I'm so confused. I'm trying to get my wabi, tron, poe and dent onto my ledger nano s via MEW but I'm having extreme difficulties. I try to add the custom tokens and it says the token is already added as a default token. Please help thanks I've been researching this for hours.",4,2017-12-29 18:02:57,2

TRX,Altcoin,How do I get started?,"Just like the title says. Does anyone here have a good video/guide on how to get started? I live in EU if that has anything to do with it. I'd just like to know how I invest into altcoins like Ripple, TRON etc. I can only see BTC, BTC Cash, ETH and LTC on the Coinbase app. Am I doing something wrong?",1,2018-01-05 22:05:06,2
TRX,Altcoin,Sending altcoin out of MEW gas calculation problem?,"I have came across several people having this issue not being able to send out of my ether wallet because they do not have the right gas calculation. It should fill in automatically when proper steps are taken I have notated the steps below that I have taken and found out to work hope this helps.

 When in MEW My Ether Wallet  Select the address bubble you would like to interact with. Then select unlock your wallet. When you are in the send withdraw section you input your destination address then below that asks you to input how much you are sending. automatically it is asking in ETH ON the drop down menu to the right. To add additional token that you are trying to withdraw look to the far right and scroll down you should see it says  Token balances how to see your tokens.  Select show all tokens and then select yours there. Next Select add custom token.  It will give you the option to add contract address. That is the address of that wallet that you are in right there you need to input that.  You need to add the token symbol say for instance you are adding tron you need to input TRX.  It asks  To input a decimal I never  put anything there and I pressed save.
 Now you should be able to scroll up and select the drop down menu next to amount to send and it should show your token symbol there you want to select it  And to the left enter the amount you want to send in that specific altcoin.  For example if you are sending 100 tron you want to enter 100. Gas limit should already be automatically input at the correct amount.  Go ahead and select generate transaction below. After that go ahead and follow the remaining steps it asks and you should be all good to go. I really hope this helps I've seen a lot of other people have the same problem without knowing how to get the appropriate amount of gas it does it automatically and it isn't expensive. One more thing make sure that the ether that you have is applied to the specific address that you are trying to withdraw from since there are several different addresses in MEW.  Feel free to ask of you have any additional questions and if this helped you please UPVOTE :) Blessings!",2,2018-01-09 13:01:05,1

TRX,Altcoin,"OCN is the currency for OBike, the budding Uber of Southeast Asia.","Here is why I think Odyssey (OCN) is an amazing project & still has a lot of potential. The CEO of Odysseys is Yi Shi, CEO of oBike & have Justin Sun, founder of Tron as his chief advisor.

*What is Odyssey Protocol?* [Source](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@madovercoins/is-ocoin-ocn-the-next-tron-trx)

ODYSSEY’s mission is to build the next-generation decentralized sharing economy & Peer to Peer Ecosystem. ODYSSEY aims to reduce overall operating cost, increase marketplace efficiency and boost ROI of product & service providers in the Global sharing economy & peer to peer ecosystem.

[Odyssey's roadmap](https://twitter.com/ODYSSEYPROTOCOL/status/953664497440382976/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FOcoin%2F)

For a new project, there is already a lot of promising [partnership & media](https://ocoin.sg/home/index.php#partner) for the coin.

- **TRON Network** -  Despite all the FUD, having support from one of the top 100 coinmarketcap is a good thing. Ocoin will be on the TRX platform. OCN will benefit from TRX’s success. Vise versa. 

- **Vision+ Capital** - one of China's most renowned investors (founded by Alibaba Co-Founder Eddie Wu) investing into Odyssey.

- **GRAB** - This is similar to uber & yet bigger than uber in the Southeast Asia. The company has invested $45M USD into oBike. There is a posibility of Grab adopting the oCoin pay system.

- There is still a few big names partnership such as **Game.com, QTUM, Amazon Web Services, Swift Wifi, IBM & PreAngel**

The ICO started less than 2 weeks ago, having 4B coins on sale, roughly around $50M & it is sold in less than 6 days without any marketing! It has been exchanges after exchanges after the day that ICO ended. It have already reached 6 cents which the ICO price is around 1.5 cents.

I think the coin is still **very undervalued** because China & US could not participate in the ICO so there is way less exposure around those areas. It have the marketcap of around 120 million which will probably placed around **#160** on Coinmarketcap.

There is still a lot of potential growth & if it eventually reach 50 cents it will be at around #33 which is very possible.

TRX,Altcoin,Buy and Hold 100 Cryptocurrencies for 5 Years - Week 7 - $1726 USD gained,"It’s the 7th week since the experiment started and I’m still here! 🙂 The more time I spend checking the experiment and the more I realize how crazy and unstable It’s going to be.

In these past weeks a lot happened,from the South Korean ban, The Re-ban from China, CME but also some good news, as the long waited Lighintg Network, which allows Bitcoin to be transferred in a few seconds and with very low fees.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is at the moment $11,298.30 USD.  and the dominance is of 34.5%, a little improvement compared to the previous weeks.

The unrealized gain of the experiment is $1,726.46 USD or 0.15 BTC.
Only 11 Cryptocurrencies are in minus since the beginning of the experiment and 3 of them have a gain of over 1000%.

With an overall gain of 172.6 %, the 100 cryptocurrencies together (CryptoETF100) performed better than 72 cryptos from the ones I have.

Let’s talk about our Top5 cryptocurrencies.

Tron (TRX) is for the 4th week in a row the best gainer. Six weeks ago I bought 2500 TRX with $10.04.  2500 TRX are worth now $209.22, a gain of 1984.58 %

TRX just announced a new cooperation with Spacety and a few days ago it was listed on Bitfinex, one of the biggest exchange around. Justin Sun, also gave hints on a new exchange, will it be Kucoin?

Vechain (VEN) has been doing wonders, there is so much going on that it’s impossible to keep up! Just to mention afew, Breyer Capital has agreed to support VeChain through an official advisory role. They just announced a new cooperation with DNV GL and also with Sentinel Chain. When I bought it 7 weeks ago, I got with $10.11 USD , 18 (VEN), at the time the price was of $ 0.56 , right now the price is $7.27, so the 18 VEN is now worth $131.03  a major gain of 1195.52 %.

Verge (XVG) keeps up being on the 3rd position with an overall gain of 1008.82 % . It successfully hard forked and stealth tx’s are now being processed.

0x Protocol (ZRX) is now in the 4th position, what looked like momentum last week was only the beginning of a big rise. With the recent hack to the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, where it lost 523 mln NEM coins, approximately $534 mln. It only made clear to all of us the importance to have a decentralized exchange. Will 0x be the answer?

Lastly, on the 5th position, we have Cardano (ADA), the overall gain is of 519.78 %, was this rise given by the fact that Binance finally fixed the withdrawal issues?

Top 5 cryptocurrencies so far :

Tron (TRX)  +1563.45 % , from $10.04 to $166.95
VeChain (VEN) +1195.52 % , from 10.11  to $131.03
Verge (XVG)  +1008.82 % , from $9.62 to $106.67
Ox (ZRX) +734.19 % , from $9.99 to $66.72
Cardano (ADA) + 519.78 % , from $9.57 to $59.31

Worst 5 cryptocurrencies so far :

Next (NXT) -45.67 % , from $9.89 to $5.37
Mona (MONA)  -54.62 % , from $9.76 to $4.43
Pura (PURA) -54.76 % , from $9.62 to $4.35
Einsteinium (EMC2) -67.56 % , from $9.51 to $3.08
Bitconnect (BCC) -97.15 % , from $9.93 to $0.28

TRX,Altcoin,"December 23rd Topics: Technology Driven Week with Christmas Surprises (XVG**, XEM*, STRAT*, ARDOR*, NXT*, MCO, PAY, BAY, WAVES, TRX)","(POSTING FOR JAKEtheCRYPTOKING,  Follow on Reddit and Instagram: JaketheCryptoKing or Twitter: JBtheCryptoKIng, he asked me to post as it wasn't working for him and look at his call on NXT this week!)

December 23rd Topics: Technology Driven Week with Christmas Surprises (XVG*, XEM, STRAT, ARDOR, NXT*, MCO, PAY, BAY)

NXT (will be in each post until the airdrop, went from $.9 yesterday when recommended to $1.70ish today), with the future value of airdrop priced this should trend toward $1.85.-$2.50. As I’m writing this I see it’s spiked over $1.60. That is almost 100% gains in 72 hours, I’ve been screaming to buy NXT in all of my prior posts. Today it popped, it should continue to trend toward $2.00. I just did the math on the IGNIS airdrop, the IGNIS has increased to $4.02 in value, meaning NXT should be worth a minimum of $2.00, a penny more for every penny NXT is worth following the airdrop, price point $2.00-$3.00 depending on if IGNIS continues to appreciates or not.

Technology: Nothing really creates 100% gains (or more) in the Crypto Markets better than technological block chain advances. This is the week’s leaders for this category…

XVG, VERGE WRAITH PROTCOL (XRG promises this to come out by end of year, plus a cool ad came out 4 days ago so I doubt they miss their deadline) anonymity with the flick of a button (public and private ledges in one block chain). XRG has promise WRAITH will be released by the end of this year, it should hit $1 when it does, McAfee although I don’t agree w/him on much he says, states $15 within 6 months of Wraith Protocol being released should be expected. I’m saying $1.00 it’s currently $.15 that’s a 600% upswing if I’m right, 6000% if McAfee is. Does it matter really who is at that point? Wrath allows the individual user to determine if they want they balance visible on the block chian or not. Right now we have coins like Monero which are completely anonymous hence their use on the dark web, or ones that are completely public where anyone who knows your wallet address can check your balance. XRG lets each user determine, public or private, this will revolutionize blockchian and altcoins.

XEM Catapult, which is version 2.0 of NEM (is to be released by the end of the year). Plus a 4 week hackathon beggning in January. There is nothing better to build awareness and test out their new Catapult network they’ll be releasing this week, then a worldwide hackathon and a new update to their NEM network.

STRAT, is going to have an amazing week. They promised that by January, ""I can confirm they will be able to host ICO's on our blockchain agnostic platform this year."" STRAT is on the cusp of being able to host ICO’s for other companies. This is extremely valuable technology and they’ve announced it will be ready to go this week. There should be anticipation, and extreme price growth once the tech is released.

ARDR, Platform launches Jan 1. Ardor’s blockchain becomes fully operational Jan 1st. Genesis snapshot announced 1 week in advance. Not to mention all those NXT you’ve been holding for the free IGNIS are used specifically on the ARDR block chain.

TRX: Promotion, Source code released on the 29th, open source platform. TRX has a promotion on Binance which drives significant trading. It is also in the Tech section because following the promotion I was expecting a drop in price, however, TRX has has their source code release on the 29th so even if there is a 1 or 2 day dip, it should explode upward on the 28th/29th.

CB Future Picks (same screenshot that showed BCC showed XRP and Monero). CB admits new coins will be added in the next few months. It was speculated in the online community that because CB released wallets for BCC, XRP, and Monero that those would be added next. CB adamantly denies that they planned to add BCC, XRP, and Monero. And then CB added BCC. I fully expect XRP and Monero to be added within 2 months, and that the original rumor they denied had some truth to it. XRP and Monero are buy and holds.

News this Week: MCO, has promised 3 surprises and a Christmas bonus. According to MCO, ""We have something special planned for all of you for December 25th and we think you will love it."" Their news cards are supposed to be released soon, maybe their debit cards (allowing you to exchange crypto for FIAT instantly) are ready! Check them out online they look GORGEOUS.

PAY & BAY (News and Surprises), Both have promised news on the 25th and given its Christmas I expect the announcements to be spectacular ones. Both have deadlines approaching for projects and I expect the announcements to either be completed projects ahead of deadlines or exciting new partnerships.

Binance Promo: TRX (real value in their code update on the 29th), price should dip after game concludes and then skyrocket after code update. TNB (garbage until Jan 11th) WAVES (different style promo, that gives entries based on accumulated WAVES).

Binance is holding 3 contests, 2 based on trading volume and 1 based on accumulation. All 3 games/promotions will drive significant trading volume of their underlying coins, in turn driving the value of the specific coins higher for the next 3-10 days depending on the specific promotion. I think this is an ingenious way for Binance to get new traders involved while holding free promotions!

WAVES’s promotion is based on how much you buy and accumulate (sales and withdrawals are counted against you). With an airdrop coming at the end of the month and NG activation yesterday I expect the next 4 days to see significant upward trending price movement (prediction: 10% per day).

TRX and TNB’s promotion is based on total trading volume with the leaders approaching 1000BTC, but there are still plenty of prizes for smaller traders (sharing 4million TRX or 2million TNB for example). The sheer demand to exchange huge volumes to get more entries creates a game like atmosphere increasing the price for the next 4 days (only 4 days left in the promotion). I expect to see a nice price jump the next 48hrs. Not to mention it is down 40% from today’s highs to still be slightly up overall today (good time to get in).

I think owning either of the three (not to play the game) but as a buy hold strategy for the 3 days while many individuals play the game is a must! If you enjoy day trading it these three are having 15-30% swings daily and you can take part in the game!

THESE ARE SOLELY STRATEGIES I USE IN THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKETS BY NO MEANS AM I TRYING TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVICE. I DO OWN SOME OF THE LISTED CURRENCIES FOR THE REASONS I’VE STATED.",24,2017-12-23 15:08:37,46

JakeIstheCryptoKing (reddit, Instagram, and Twitter: JBTheCryptoKing) asked if I'd submit this for him because Altcoin was removing it instantly for some reason? This is NOT my post but his and because he's been so cordial to correspond with I decided to post it for him! Follow him below. Anyone know why I can post it but he can't?! He's made great posts this week...)

Yesterday and last night were fun ones! Depending on what time you checked your portfolio it may have been up 10% or down 30%. I personally think there was significant manipulation holding the crypto market down as a whole yesterday, while it prepares for the rally from Christmas Eve – End of January (conferences planned every weekend across the globe). I posted days ago predicting XRP would be added to CB as my favorite pick and was significantly disappointed when BCC was chosen over it. However, CB promised multiple currencies in Q1 of 2018 so XRP I believe is still a candidate (XMR too). The market agrees with me hence the 100% increase in the last 48hrs. I am still recommending buying and holding XRP, even at the $1.00 price point (my original recommendation came when it was under $.5). The price spiked to over $1.40 yesterday and this type of volatility can make you wealthy on 30% day trade margins, or 100% buy and holds. XRP is one of the few currencies that functions well with banks, is being tested by multiple banks in Japan and by Mastercard with positive news from all thus far. Buy and hold.

NXT dropped slightly with the market yesterday even though their airdrop was supported by Bittrex and is valued at approx. $1.40 per coin. The airdrop is valued at more than the underlying coin currently meaning NXT will have to appreciate to a minimum of $1.40, likely $2.00+ with news that Poloniex or another exchange is also supporting the airdrop. We have a week before the airdrop and I expect extreme appreciation of most altcoin prices over the holidays. NXT should be trading at a minimum value of the airdrop $1.40- $3.00 (upper limit). I hope everyone picked up some NXT at $.90 last night (trading at $1.10 right now)!

MCO still has me and many other anxiously awaiting the news they’ve promised to release on the 24th. I expect it to continue to produce gains of 10-15% leading up to the 24th with a likely pop leading up to the announcements and a significant climb if the surprise announcement is positive! (on Christmas eve how could it not?).

PAY and BAY have Christmas surprises coming and both are near completion of many of their projects. What could the surprise be? The suspense alone should be enough to drive the prices up 20% minimum in the next 3 days.

WAVES has their NG activation today (supposedly) stay tuned for that as it should increase the price per coin leading into the airdrop and Binance contest listed below. The NG activation greatly increases the speed in which transactions take place (a key factor of coin functionality, why XRP is so successful right now).

BINANCE CONTESTS EXPLAINED: WAVES, TNB, TRX Binance is holding 3 contests, 2 based on trading volume and 1 based on accumulation. All 3 games/promotions will drive significant trading volume of their underlying coins, in turn driving the value of the specific coins higher for the next 3-10 days depending on the specific promotion. I think this is an ingenious way for Binance to get new traders involved while holding free promotions!

WAVES’s promotion is based on how much you buy and accumulate (sales and withdrawals are counted against you). With an airdrop coming at the end of the month and NG activation in 36 hours I expect the next 4 days to see significant upward trending price movement (prediction: 10% per day).

TRX and TNB’s promotion is based on total trading volume with the leaders approaching 1000BTC, but there are still plenty of prizes for smaller traders (sharing 4million TRX or 2million TNB for example). The sheer demand to exchange huge volumes to get more entries creates a game like atmosphere increasing the price for the next 4 days (only 4 days left in the promotion). I expect to see a nice price jump the next 48hrs. Not to mention it is down 40% from today’s highs to still be slightly up overall today (good time to get in).

I think owning either of the three (not to play the game) but as a buy hold strategy for the 3 days while many individuals play the game is a must! If you enjoy day trading it these three are having 15-30% swings daily and you can take part in the game!

THESE ARE SOLELY STRATEGIES I USE IN THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKETS BY NO MEANS AM I TRYING TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVICE. I DO OWN SOME OF THE LISTED CURRENCIES FOR THE REASONS I’VE STATED.",8,2017-12-22 17:37:38,29

TRX,Altcoin,Buy and Hold 100 Cryptocurrencies for 5 years - Week 5 - $2553 gained,"It’s the 5th week since the experiment has started and a lot has been happening, I actually wonder to know if during the 5 years of the experiment there is going to be a quiet week.
The crypto world has been bombarded by FUD, first with China banning the miners, then with South Korean ban on the exchanges, all this caused the price of Bitcoin (BTC) to go as low as $13,105.90 USD. As if it wasn’t enough, Warren Buffet said that “Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies will come to a bad end”. All these caused also the altcoins price to go on a rollercoaster, but today seems like most of them are bouncing back.
To go into details about the experiment, the overall gain is $2533 USD (253%) or 0.19 BTC.
Only 10 Cryptocurrencies are in minus since the beginning of the experiment and 3 of them have reached a gain of over 1000 %.
Let’s talk about our Top5 cryptocurrencies.
Tron (TRX) is also for this week the best gainer. Five weeks ago I bought 2500 TRX with $10.04.  2500 TRX are worth now $275.48, a gain of 2644.83 %
Justin Sun, founder of Tron. Announced this week a new cooperation with Bao Feng, and been teasing about a cooperation with an innovative space company.
Verge (XVG) finally released to so waited Wraith protocol. The price has been stable and 1 XVG is now worth $0.15 , I first bought it 5 weeks ago at $0.0079.
Vechain (VEN) is the first new entry on the Top5,  looking at the chart it has been rising for over one month. In fact, when I bought it 5 weeks ago, I got with $10.11 , 18 (VEN), at the time the price was of $ 0.56 , right now the price is $6.24, so the 18 VEN is now worth $112.48 a major gain of 1012.14 %.
The other new entry on the Top5, sitting at the 4th position is Binance Coin (BNB), it’s been a while since BNB has been performing well, not sure about the exact reason, but it could be connected by the fact that Binance volume keeps growing massively. BNB can be used as trading fee option on Binance, doing so it lowers the trading fees from 0.1 % to 0.05%.
Binace volume has been that high that they could barely keep up and had to halt a few time the sign up of new users. From a recent tweet, they announced that they got over 5 Million users!
Ripple (XRP) is having again a big momentum, yesterday MoneyGram signed a deal with them announcing that it will use it to speed up their transitions. I believe this is one of the biggest wins for Ripple so far.
Top 5 cryptocurrencies so far :
Tron (TRX)  +2644.83 % , from $10.04 to $275.48
Verge (XVG)  +1794.52 % , from $9.62 to $182.25
VeChain (VEN) +1012.14 % , from 10.11  to $112.48
Binance Coin (BNB) +914.17 % , from $9.99 to $99.48
Ripple (XRP)  +837.01 % , from $9.75 to $91.34

TRX,Altcoin,"Most talked about and upvoted altcoins and cryptos in r/cryptocurrency, week ending 2018-01-13","tl;dr: (skip to “Trending Cryptos”)

**INTRO**

Like most of us here, I’ve been following the posts on this subreddit (and r/cryptocurrency) diligently, and have been able to make some good crypto investments from all the shilling, discussion, and even fud that happens here!

I don’t have enough time to read everything and constantly check the reddit app, but I still don’t want to miss out on opportunities that come from a crypto being talked a lot about on here.

So I developed a program for myself that collects data on the cryptos that are being talked about most (both in terms of number of posts, and total number of upvotes) on r/cryptocurrency. I can quickly browse the headlines of the top posts it collects, as well as see at a glance which cryptos are “trending” or “buzzing” on r/cryptocurrency in the recent weeks. The program also pulls in Coinmarketcap API data, like current market cap and 7 day price change. Aggregating all this data automatically has saved me a lot of time and allowed me to focus my research efforts on the cryptos that I think could have the highest potential e.g. low market cap, recently “buzzing” cryptos on r/cryptocurrency.

I’ve decided to share the outputs of my program, as well as some highlights I’ve written, here for the benefit of this subreddit (and may do so periodically). Let me know if you have any feedback, questions, or suggestions, always looking to improve and share more interesting data here!

**TRENDING CRYPTOS**

**Highlights:**

1. **Bounty0x**, **AppCoins** and **COSS** are lower market cap cryptos that experienced a dramatic increase in buzz last week
2. Both **NEO**’s price and buzz still continue to increase from last week, even though the token has a $9.5B market capitalization
3. **Ripple**’s price and buzz continue to fall

TRX,Altcoin,"If you had $350 to invest with, which altcoins would you get?","I have that much I'm willing to use for altcoins at the moment. I currently have TRX, STR, XRP, MIOTA, EOS, and XRB (in order from most to least). Due to money issues, I had to sell what little bitcoin I had but still doubled my profits. Obviously, I would like to be able to retire after holding lol but as long as I get enough profits for 1 BTC and a nice amount of fiat, I'll be a happy camper. I plan to put what I can onto my ledger that I purchased with btc, and put the rest into wallets and forget about them for awhile.

If you were in my shoes would you add any other altcoins or just get more of what I listed above?",16,2018-01-05 20:35:23,48

TRX,Altcoin,Buy and Hold 100 Crypto for 5 Years - Week 21 - 1153 USD / 115.3 % gain,"After a long break due to work, I’m back to write a bit update.
It’s been 21 weeks since I started the experiment. Since then a lot has been going on and I’m glad to see that I’m still gaining $1153 and 0.12 BTC.

The price of Bitcoin is currently at $ 9831, showing a bit gain since the bearish phase going on since March. Is this the beginning of a Bull Run?
The dominance of BTC is at 36% and the Market Cap at 465 Billion, definitely showing a good come back of the cryptos in general.
A nice thing to notice about the experiment is that so far only 29 cryptos are in minus, which means that the (CryptoETF100) is performing way better than a single crypto. Also, the gain in BTC is at 0.12 BTC, more than double of what I originally invested.
 
Let’s talk about our Top3 cryptocurrencies.

With an impressive gain of 2090.56 %  Tron (TRX) is the overall winner. The $10.04 originally invested are worth now $219.86, not sure if there is another crypto that performed this well lately! With the almost imminent lunch of the Main Net I’m sure this is going to be a fun ride! 😉

The second overall gainer is Verge (XVG) a crypto with a massive community, one of the biggest in the crypto world. Even with a lot of controversy XVG is still performing really well. With a gain of 916.09$ n the experiment this is definitely a coin that is making the difference!

Lastly Vechain (VEN), I’m sure many of you have heard about it and to be honest I’m not impressed by the gains. VEN is believed to be one of the most promising projects. The 18 VEN I bought 21 weeks ago with $10.11 is now worth $98.75, big gain true, but I’m very positive about a bigger gain, especially with the lunch of the Main Net with Masternodes at the end June!

TRX,Altcoin,"FUD my alts, shill me yours! (Binance coins only pls)","I'm beginning to think it's not wise to get trapped in the echo chambers of coin specific subreddits and other online forms. Give me some FUD on my coins and shill me yours ( Binance coins preferred). Don't worry about hitting me hard with FUD, I've had strong hands thus far, but I would love to hear opposing views.

My alt picks:
OMG -solid team 
NEO -wish I had more, 2018 might 
XLM -solid partners, blue collar XRP
IOTA -interesting concept 
BAT-marketing token
STRAT-good team
XVG -a silly hold IMO (Monero is king?)
EOS- fomo fomo fomo
XRP- sketch, solid returns tho 
TRX -fomo got to me, seems overvalued
SUB - come on, why not?
QSP - personal favorite
ICX -been killing it lately on returns 
FUN- a long shot gamble, ironic right?
STRAT- solid team, okay partners
VIB- bought on a whim, website screams marketing scam. I fell for the pretty website lol
LTC -served me incredibly well, but then Charlie Lee loves fud his brainchild. Get off twitter CL. 

Regrets (missed the boat):
LSK - scoped it out at $2, $6, & $8. Then I got busy with school and never pulled the trig. What a rookie!

ADA - people love to shill, but I want to hear some FUD about it. Such a quick moonshot to top 25 CoinMarketCap. YouTuber shills everywhere!

Bought NXT @ $2, so that didn't pan out for me at all, and to round it out since I didn't have a lot of money to invest I bought a few ENG, QASH and WABI. Also invested in longer hodls hoping to moon I invested into MoonCoin, Reddcoin, XP, DOGE and KIN. All this based on reading recommendations on reddit for the past 2 weeks and researching the coins. So any recommendations will be appreciated along with why you would recommend the coin, as I have come across some coins that I felt had no real purpose then to make money for people invested in it from the beginning.

TRX,Altcoin,Good altcoin projects you see bright future on?,"Hello everyone! 
This is my first post on reddit. Hopefully I don't break any rule.

There is a lot of blockchain ideas and projects. Many of them stand for the same functionality - payment method. I was wondering if you guys can help me find good proven projects, which are more than just payment method.
So far I've found two projects I think they have reliable value in the future for users. 
First of is SiaCoin - a decentralized decentralized storage platform. Something like google drive, but it uses blockchain to store data. I won't describe all details about it, I just want to know if you guys know something simillar.
Second is Tronix (TRX), it's very similar to Siacoin, but it doesn't have functioning product like Sia does and works in some different way than sia. Anyway, I'd like to focus on those two projects and find some simillar and good altcoins usefull in the future, not only as a payment method.

These are the coins i am interested in:

Power Ledger (POWR)
TenX(PAY)
Substratum (SUB)
VeChain (VEN)
IOTA (IOTA)
Request Network(REQ)
TRON (TRX)

These are the exchanges i have considered: 

Bittrex
Binance
Liqui.io
Poloniex

I dont know what exchange to go with or if it even makes that much of a difference. i dont want to have to go to different exchanges to buy/sell 1 altcoin. I want to be able to go to one place. ""So why dont you just go see which exchange has all those coins and pick that one?""....Well i dont know what exchanges are good or how they compare to each other. basically i need some guidance from people more experienced to get me headed in the right direction, thats why i posted this.

Also whats the difference between (for example) IOTA/BTC and IOTA/ETH? Does it have to do with the market they're in?

TRX,Altcoin,bridge Pricing Algorithm," 

As said before price of requests are calculated based on a special algorithm. Price is consisted of 3 main parts as follows:

*Query Price = Cost of Query Type + Query Fee Limit* *+ Maximum Bandwidth Price*

Each kind of query from oracle type or data source point of view, has a specific price that creates ""Cost of Query Type"" part. In fact, this part is cost of using Bridge services. This part is consisted of two parts by itself that is calculated as follows:

*Cost of Query Type = Base Price × Multiplier*

Base price was introduced to calculate cost of Bridge services. In fact base price is unit price of providing service for a request with Multiplier 1. Multiplier shows complexity of a task based on resource consumption. One can investigate base price and multiplier of various type of requests in the following tables:

TRX,Altcoin,Data from the top 20 fastest growing communities in crypto over the last month,"Hey everyone, for the past couple months I have been working on a project called [Coinmunity](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinmunity-bitcoin-altcoin-app/id1322869245?mt=8). Coinmunity is an app that focuses on the growth of crypto communities, which in the market right now, has so much effect in driving price changes. Each day it tracks which coins have the combined highest % of growth in their Twitter and Reddit communities combined.

&nbsp;

Today, Coinmunity has now been live for one month, so I thought I would share what patterns I have personally picked out, having worked on the data, and observing the rankings during development and while live.

&nbsp;

What I have noticed is that you will see certain coins start to creep up higher and higher into the top 10 or 15 communities consistently before a price increase. The best example is TRX. You can see from this reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7k2c4g/congrats_rtronix_you_were_the_top_growing/) that I made 27 days ago, that /r/Tron had the top community while it was still at $.01 ( and it continues to consistently be in top 10 even now.) I think most of us can agree TRX has some big issues, but the point is that it’s very important to know which coins have the most eyes on them; because when people are watching a coin, they’ll usually buy it.

*Total social change => reddit and twitter growth

&nbsp;

It probably wouldn’t be the best decision to buy a coin based off just community growth, so Coinmunity pulls each coin’s full subreddit to make it easy to quickly research the coin and see if there is any upcoming big news. 

&nbsp;

**Some upcoming features that we think will add value:**

* Google trends

* Marketcap and volume rankings

* Track personal investments

&nbsp;

If you have an android, the app is currently in development, but I have made a mobile friendly web app that is available at https://coinmunity.co! I will announce on the Coinmunity [twitter](https://twitter.com/coinmunityapp) when it is completed.

&nbsp;

As Coinmunity continues to grow, I will start to collect more and more data on social activity surrounding these coins, such as retweets,comments, upvotes, etc. One relationship that I am looking forward to explore is the amount of exchanges a coin is available on vs social growth vs price growth. I think there is a sweet-spot before a coin is widely enough available to experience huge price jumps, where it would be the best time to buy a coin. If this is something you guys are interested in please let me know and I will continue to post each month about further discoveries from the data!

TRX,Altcoin,Digitex - World's First Decentralized Futures Exchange ICO Launch,"Came across this upcoming ICO. It's called Digitex and it's a new futures exchange that will do BTC/ETH/LTC to USD. Best of all, they are operating with zero fees. They pay for the fees by creating tokens, but the token holders determine how many new tokens are created to cover the fees for each year. 

Decentralized exchange . Account balances of traders will be held by a decentralized, independent smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, not by the exchange.

Zero trading fees.

Traders need DGTX tokens to trade. So they will be much more in demand than KCS and BNB.

1,000,000,000 initial supply, which is 1/100 of Tron(TRX) supply. Price per token $0.01

Built using the Elixir programming language and partners with 'Plataformatec', a software company founded by Jose Valim, the creator of the Elixir language.

The team consists of the developer and also the owner of a successful UK trading platform (Betfair Sports Trading Software for Mac & PC from RacingTraders https://racingtraders.co.uk/ ) which has been in existence for some years (see their twitter https://twitter.com/racingtraders or google them). Other team members are experienced too.

Sign up using just your email and you receive 1000 DGTX tokens for free each time when someone signs up using your referral link. Do it before Jan 15 , when token sale starts. 1 DGTX is $0.01 as of now. Additional 1000 DGTX to you if that someone also refers friends. Still additionally you get 30% of the ETH your friends spend in the DGTX token sale. You get them after Jan 15.

Please use my referral if you found this post useful: https://vrlps.co/a?pt=24egHeF-mYgN9sCzFHAbpvZzKrw&referralCode=r18dziCmG&refSource=copy

Podcast with the CEO: https://juicestorm.com/podcast/307-digitex-futures-exchange-adam-todd/

About him: https://racingtraders.co.uk/about/adam-todd.html

FYI - The team is vested for a year before they can sell any of their tokens.

TRX,Altcoin,Best Altcoins 2018,"HI Everyone, these are my altcoins for 2018. Curious on people's opinions:

CND Cindicator
TRX Tron
XLM Stellar Lumens
BRD Bread
ADA Cardano
IOTA MIOTA
SUB Substratum
XRP Ripple
BQX Ethos
AION AION

Question is which types of blockchain companies have the most upside for 2018. I am guessing companies that help make cryptocurrencies accessible to the general public ETHOS, BRD. Curious on people's thoughts.",5,2018-01-04 10:23:16,6
TRX,Altcoin,Please help me understand,"I've recently moved on from Coinbase, and taken my earning to Binance. Researched a few that I liked and made a decent profit all while BTC was hovering under 14,000.

After getting back into these same positions after a dip (TRX for example), I'm having a hard time understanding if I'm losing or breaking even while BTC goes to 17,000, even though the alt is staying the same. The TRX is still worth roughly $0.20 although it buys me much less BTC if I convert. The estimated amount of the position has barely changed even though BTC is way up and from how it looks, TRX is way down. 

Is there a relation between the prices that's easier to understand? BTC up so TRX down, or vise versa?
Is it better to use BTC to buy an altcoin when BTC is up or down?
How can a move for an altcoin be predicted based on the movement of BTC (if I expect BTC to drop from here, is it a good or bad time to use it to buy an alt?

Does any of this even goddam matter????

It's currently reasonably low in comparison to the last month, however Chinese new years is around the corner and if it's anything like the dip before January 1st then it would be a good time to buy.

What do you guys think? Is it going to dip even more the days before Feb 16th?",1,2018-01-23 16:38:47,4

TRX,Altcoin,Digitex - World's First Decentralized Futures Exchange ICO Launch - 1000 free tokens,"Came across this upcoming ICO. It's called Digitex and it's a new futures exchange that will do BTC/ETH/LTC to USD. Best of all, they are operating with zero fees. They pay for the fees by creating tokens, but the token holders determine how many new tokens are created to cover the fees for each year. Decentralized exchange . Account balances of traders will be held by a decentralized, independent smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, not by the exchange. Zero trading fees. Traders need DGTX tokens to trade. So they will be much more in demand than KCS and BNB. 1,000,000,000 initial supply, which is 1/100 of Tron(TRX) supply. Price per token $0.01 Built using the Elixir programming language and partners with 'Plataformatec', a software company founded by Jose Valim, the creator of the Elixir language. The team consists of the developer and also the owner of a successful UK trading platform (Betfair Sports Trading Software for Mac & PC from RacingTraders https://racingtraders.co.uk/ ) which has been in existence for some years (see their twitter https://twitter.com/racingtraders or google them). Other team members are experienced too. Sign up using just your email and you receive 1000 DGTX tokens for free each time when someone signs up using your referral link. Do it before Jan 15 , when token sale starts. 1 DGTX is $0.01 as of now. Additional 1000 DGTX to you if that someone also refers friends. Still additionally you get 30% of the ETH your friends spend in the DGTX token sale. You get them after Jan 15. Please use my referral if you found this post useful: https://vrlps.co/a?pt=24egHeF-mYgN9sCzFHAbpvZzKrw&referralCode=Sy6sr_1Vz&refSource=copy Podcast with the CEO: https://juicestorm.com/podcast/307-digitex-futures-exchange-adam-todd/ About him: https://racingtraders.co.uk/about/adam-todd.html FYI - The team is vested for a year before they can sell any of their tokens.",8,2018-01-07 03:01:35,3

 There are more events but this message got too long",7,2018-04-04 14:08:41,2
TRX,Altcoin,Rate my alt coin portfolio!,"Hi All,

I switched from investing in just BTC/LTC/ETH, to adding in some other large marketcap coins, to then deciding that my favorite coins are less than 1 billion in marketcap as they still have a lot of room for organic growth.  I tried to put equal sums of money into each coin and I'm up a good amount with this portfolio, and there is still a lot of room for growth with most of these coins marketcaps.  I try to keep up with each coin, but it is more so focused on making sure they are meeting their objectives than following the FUD.  The only time I let go of one of these is when I feel that it would be impossible to return 10x gains in 1-2 years (I might drop ADA), when a team is underdelivering, or when I feel that the coin is overvalued based on future potential.  I make a FIAT deposit monthly and try and either invest in an interesting ICO, add to my position on a coin that is undervalued or invest in something new.  I made a good amount with ripple, but decided the chances it goes to 1 trillion within 1 year were much less likely than one of my other coins going from 300million to 3 billion so I decided to sell my entire position around 1 week ago.  I re-invested all of my ripple profits into this portfolio and it has paid off so far.  This portfolio allows me to manage risk and volatility while also seeing some pretty impressive gains.  Let me know your thoughts!

So recently I started looking into altcoins since I made some profits with ETH. 
Im still a noob and new to this world that's why I want to hear your opinion on how I should divide my portfolio,

*NEO: 3.38%
*IOT: 3.23%
*XRP: 3.15%

TRX,Altcoin,Sending altcoin out of MEW gas calculation problem?,"I have came across several people having this issue not being able to send out of my ether wallet because they do not have the right gas calculation. It should fill in automatically when proper steps are taken I have notated the steps below that I have taken and found out to work hope this helps.

 When in MEW My Ether Wallet  Select the address bubble you would like to interact with. Then select unlock your wallet. When you are in the send withdraw section you input your destination address then below that asks you to input how much you are sending. automatically it is asking in ETH ON the drop down menu to the right. To add additional token that you are trying to withdraw look to the far right and scroll down you should see it says  Token balances how to see your tokens.  Select show all tokens and then select yours there. Next Select add custom token.  It will give you the option to add contract address. That is the address of that wallet that you are in right there you need to input that.  You need to add the token symbol say for instance you are adding tron you need to input TRX.  It asks  To input a decimal I never  put anything there and I pressed save.
 Now you should be able to scroll up and select the drop down menu next to amount to send and it should show your token symbol there you want to select it  And to the left enter the amount you want to send in that specific altcoin.  For example if you are sending 100 tron you want to enter 100. Gas limit should already be automatically input at the correct amount.  Go ahead and select generate transaction below. After that go ahead and follow the remaining steps it asks and you should be all good to go. I really hope this helps I've seen a lot of other people have the same problem without knowing how to get the appropriate amount of gas it does it automatically and it isn't expensive. One more thing make sure that the ether that you have is applied to the specific address that you are trying to withdraw from since there are several different addresses in MEW.  Feel free to ask of you have any additional questions and if this helped you please UPVOTE :) Blessings!",2,2018-01-09 13:01:05,1

TRX,Altcoin,"OCN is the currency for OBike, the budding Uber of Southeast Asia.","Here is why I think Odyssey (OCN) is an amazing project & still has a lot of potential. The CEO of Odysseys is Yi Shi, CEO of oBike & have Justin Sun, founder of Tron as his chief advisor.

*What is Odyssey Protocol?* [Source](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@madovercoins/is-ocoin-ocn-the-next-tron-trx)

ODYSSEY’s mission is to build the next-generation decentralized sharing economy & Peer to Peer Ecosystem. ODYSSEY aims to reduce overall operating cost, increase marketplace efficiency and boost ROI of product & service providers in the Global sharing economy & peer to peer ecosystem.

[Odyssey's roadmap](https://twitter.com/ODYSSEYPROTOCOL/status/953664497440382976/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FOcoin%2F)

For a new project, there is already a lot of promising [partnership & media](https://ocoin.sg/home/index.php#partner) for the coin.

- **TRON Network** -  Despite all the FUD, having support from one of the top 100 coinmarketcap is a good thing. Ocoin will be on the TRX platform. OCN will benefit from TRX’s success. Vise versa. 

- **Vision+ Capital** - one of China's most renowned investors (founded by Alibaba Co-Founder Eddie Wu) investing into Odyssey.

- **GRAB** - This is similar to uber & yet bigger than uber in the Southeast Asia. The company has invested $45M USD into oBike. There is a posibility of Grab adopting the oCoin pay system.

- There is still a few big names partnership such as **Game.com, QTUM, Amazon Web Services, Swift Wifi, IBM & PreAngel**

The ICO started less than 2 weeks ago, having 4B coins on sale, roughly around $50M & it is sold in less than 6 days without any marketing! It has been exchanges after exchanges after the day that ICO ended. It have already reached 6 cents which the ICO price is around 1.5 cents.

I think the coin is still **very undervalued** because China & US could not participate in the ICO so there is way less exposure around those areas. It have the marketcap of around 120 million which will probably placed around **#160** on Coinmarketcap.

There is still a lot of potential growth & if it eventually reach 50 cents it will be at around #33 which is very possible.

TRX,Altcoin,Buy and Hold 100 Cryptocurrencies for 5 Years - Week 7 - $1726 USD gained,"It’s the 7th week since the experiment started and I’m still here! 🙂 The more time I spend checking the experiment and the more I realize how crazy and unstable It’s going to be.

In these past weeks a lot happened,from the South Korean ban, The Re-ban from China, CME but also some good news, as the long waited Lighintg Network, which allows Bitcoin to be transferred in a few seconds and with very low fees.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is at the moment $11,298.30 USD.  and the dominance is of 34.5%, a little improvement compared to the previous weeks.

The unrealized gain of the experiment is $1,726.46 USD or 0.15 BTC.
Only 11 Cryptocurrencies are in minus since the beginning of the experiment and 3 of them have a gain of over 1000%.

With an overall gain of 172.6 %, the 100 cryptocurrencies together (CryptoETF100) performed better than 72 cryptos from the ones I have.

Let’s talk about our Top5 cryptocurrencies.

Tron (TRX) is for the 4th week in a row the best gainer. Six weeks ago I bought 2500 TRX with $10.04.  2500 TRX are worth now $209.22, a gain of 1984.58 %

TRX just announced a new cooperation with Spacety and a few days ago it was listed on Bitfinex, one of the biggest exchange around. Justin Sun, also gave hints on a new exchange, will it be Kucoin?

Vechain (VEN) has been doing wonders, there is so much going on that it’s impossible to keep up! Just to mention afew, Breyer Capital has agreed to support VeChain through an official advisory role. They just announced a new cooperation with DNV GL and also with Sentinel Chain. When I bought it 7 weeks ago, I got with $10.11 USD , 18 (VEN), at the time the price was of $ 0.56 , right now the price is $7.27, so the 18 VEN is now worth $131.03  a major gain of 1195.52 %.

Verge (XVG) keeps up being on the 3rd position with an overall gain of 1008.82 % . It successfully hard forked and stealth tx’s are now being processed.

0x Protocol (ZRX) is now in the 4th position, what looked like momentum last week was only the beginning of a big rise. With the recent hack to the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, where it lost 523 mln NEM coins, approximately $534 mln. It only made clear to all of us the importance to have a decentralized exchange. Will 0x be the answer?

Lastly, on the 5th position, we have Cardano (ADA), the overall gain is of 519.78 %, was this rise given by the fact that Binance finally fixed the withdrawal issues?

Top 5 cryptocurrencies so far :

Tron (TRX)  +1563.45 % , from $10.04 to $166.95
VeChain (VEN) +1195.52 % , from 10.11  to $131.03
Verge (XVG)  +1008.82 % , from $9.62 to $106.67
Ox (ZRX) +734.19 % , from $9.99 to $66.72
Cardano (ADA) + 519.78 % , from $9.57 to $59.31

Worst 5 cryptocurrencies so far :

Next (NXT) -45.67 % , from $9.89 to $5.37
Mona (MONA)  -54.62 % , from $9.76 to $4.43
Pura (PURA) -54.76 % , from $9.62 to $4.35
Einsteinium (EMC2) -67.56 % , from $9.51 to $3.08
Bitconnect (BCC) -97.15 % , from $9.93 to $0.28

TRX,Altcoin,"Tron hires Lucien Chen, Big Data Expert from Tencent and Alibaba","TRON operator, Singapore-based Tron Foundation has announced the hiring of Big Data expert, Lucien Chen, will join the TRON team, effective immediately. Previously, Chen has worked in Tencent and Alibaba and has officially joined the TRON team as the technical leader responsible for the main chain development of TRON. Chen will make the coordination plan of TRON's global technical team and arrange all project development schedules. Lucien Chen has served in many first-tier Internet companies, such as Netease (NASDAQ:NTES), youdao, Tencent (00700.HK), Qihoo 360(NASDAQ:QIHU) and SM search (Alibaba P8 +). With capabilities of developing million-level system architecture, Chen has rich experience in big data, advertising algorithms, DMP systems, BT systems, CTR platforms and high concurrent system framework designs.

Chen also has great practical experience in team management, strategic planning, and business integration. Apart from that, Chen has a deep understanding of cryptography, supporting and investing in Bitcoin from an early stage. Lucien Chen said, ""I believe that the blockchain is the base for all future technological developments, and the TRON project is the right starting point for the online entertainment scene. I am looking forward to growing with TRON, and working together to create a new world.”

Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, said, “Mr. Chen has an excellent occupational background and profound professional expertise. His technical strength and knowledge will help TRON reach its professional goals according to the challenging timescales we have set. I believe that with Mr. Chen addition to our team, TRON will live up to the expectations of the supporters.”

TRON is a blockchain-based decentralized protocol that aims to construct a worldwide free content entertainment system on the blockchain complete with distributed storage technology. The protocol allows each user to freely publish, store and own their own data. As the TRON blockchain is in a decentralized autonomous form, the platform decides the distribution, subscription, and push of content, thus forming a decentralized content entertainment ecosystem.

TRON was founded by Justin Sun, the former Chief Representative of Ripple in Greater China, and according to coinmarketcap.com, the authoritative virtual currency information website, the total market value of TRON official tokens (TRX) has ranked in the Top 40 with a value of more than $160 million.",2,2017-10-12 19:26:37,0

GMCoin will be listed on LBank on 27th September 2021 (tentative date) SMBs and SMEs require a more simple, quick, and sustainable approach to fundraise in an inflationary market since this issue generates an unsustainable growth. As a result of this, they feel that tokenization is the ideal solution for this. 

They are currently aiming to transform a 10-year-old company into a completely tokenized model.  When Security Tokens are completely legalized in various countries, they will release their GMI security token, which is limited to 8 million and is linked to actual corporate shares, stocks, and securities. Furthermore, GMI will only be available for purchase using GMC token, which will be utilized as a gateway token to GMI in the future.

They claimed that they would have many exchange alliances, business collaborations, license purchases, and a plethora of other exciting announcements in the coming months. I believe organizations should be on the lookout for this one because GMCoin protects enterprises from the negative financial consequences of data theft, GMCoin meets this key criteria by never allowing sensitive cardholder information to contact your systems in the first place, and many more.",152,2021-09-21 13:08:41,20

Around 800 holders now, supply locked at 700 million, the low market cap is steadily increasing, this is as early as you can catch a true #MoonShot candidate before it reaches escape velocity 🚀🚀🚀.

Seed Round sells at a great discount vs the upcoming IDO which is scheduled to launch right after expansion to Binance Smart Chain, a very high probability play exists here for a minimum 12-14x which is frankly a conservative estimate comparing how well even lesser and totally anonymous IDO candidates have recently fared on BSC...

Just to be clear Tron Network has also invested a lot on launchpads recently, and there is a chance the IDO can occur on Tron too, which will lead to even faster price appreciation as FRX is a native TRC20.

Here is the landing page for the Seed Round, all you need is a Tron wallet that accepts TRC20 tokens to receive $FRX ( like TronLink or Trust Wallet ) 🏆: [**www.feroxadvisors.com/frx**](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx)[ ](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx)🏆

Just to be clear Tron Network has also started investing in launchpads recently, and there is a chance the IDO can occur on Tron too, which will lead to even faster price appreciation as $FRX is a native TRC20.

For our highly risk adverse investors who like to play a safe game, Central Exchange Listings also coming up and shortlisted for September.

TRX,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Trying to find my TRX wallet/exchange...,"Hey,

So I think it was 2018 and TRX/Tron did an airdrop of all ETH holders. I remember getting some from the airdrop, but at the time had to use a different exchange for it to the usual Binance/BitTrex.

The exchange that I used I think was chinese, and I'm sure included the letter H.. it might have ended in .io

I know this is a long-shot, but does anybody have any idea what exchange it might have been?",0,2021-05-02 19:56:34,0

TRX,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"December 22nd Picks: XRP(CB), NXT(airdrop), WAVES(**NG Activation & Promo), TNB(Promo), TRX(Promo), MCO(Christmas News “CN”), PAY(CN), BAY(CN)","December 22nd Picks: XRP(CB), NXT(airdrop), WAVES(**NG Activation & Promo), TNB(Promo), TRX(Promo), MCO(Christmas News “CN”), PAY(CN), BAY(CN)

Yesterday and last night were fun ones! Depending on what time you checked your portfolio it may have been up 10% or down 30%. I personally think there was significant manipulation holding the crypto market down as a whole yesterday, while it prepares for the rally from Christmas Eve – End of January (conferences planned every weekend across the globe). I posted days ago predicting XRP would be added to CB as my favorite pick and was significantly disappointed when BCC was chosen over it. However, CB promised multiple currencies in Q1 of 2018 so XRP I believe is still a candidate (XMR too). The market agrees with me hence the 100% increase in the last 48hrs. I am still recommending buying and holding XRP, even at the $1.00 price point (my original recommendation came when it was under $.5). The price spiked to over $1.40 yesterday and this type of volatility can make you wealthy on 30% day trade margins, or 100% buy and holds. XRP is one of the few currencies that functions well with banks, is being tested by multiple banks in Japan and by Mastercard with positive news from all thus far. Buy and hold.

NXT dropped slightly with the market yesterday even though their airdrop was supported by Bittrex and is valued at approx. $1.40 per coin. The airdrop is valued at more than the underlying coin currently meaning NXT will have to appreciate to a minimum of $1.40, likely $2.00+ with news that Poloniex or another exchange is also supporting the airdrop. We have a week before the airdrop and I expect extreme appreciation of most altcoin prices over the holidays. NXT should be trading at a minimum value of the airdrop $1.40- $3.00 (upper limit). I hope everyone picked up some NXT at $.90 last night (trading at $1.10 right now)!

MCO still has me and many other anxiously awaiting the news they’ve promised to release on the 24th. I expect it to continue to produce gains of 10-15% leading up to the 24th with a likely pop leading up to the announcements and a significant climb if the surprise announcement is positive! (on Christmas eve how could it not?).

PAY and BAY have Christmas surprises coming and both are near completion of many of their projects. What could the surprise be? The suspense alone should be enough to drive the prices up 20% minimum in the next 3 days.

WAVES has their NG activation today (supposedly) stay tuned for that as it should increase the price per coin leading into the airdrop and Binance contest listed below. The NG activation greatly increases the speed in which transactions take place (a key factor of coin functionality, why XRP is so successful right now).

BINANCE CONTESTS EXPLAINED: WAVES, TNB, TRX Binance is holding 3 contests, 2 based on trading volume and 1 based on accumulation. All 3 games/promotions will drive significant trading volume of their underlying coins, in turn driving the value of the specific coins higher for the next 3-10 days depending on the specific promotion. I think this is an ingenious way for Binance to get new traders involved while holding free promotions!

WAVES’s promotion is based on how much you buy and accumulate (sales and withdrawals are counted against you). With an airdrop coming at the end of the month and NG activation in 36 hours I expect the next 4 days to see significant upward trending price movement (prediction: 10% per day).

TRX and TNB’s promotion is based on total trading volume with the leaders approaching 1000BTC, but there are still plenty of prizes for smaller traders (sharing 4million TRX or 2million TNB for example). The sheer demand to exchange huge volumes to get more entries creates a game like atmosphere increasing the price for the next 4 days (only 4 days left in the promotion). I expect to see a nice price jump the next 48hrs. Not to mention it is down 40% from today’s highs to still be slightly up overall today (good time to get in).

I think owning either of the three (not to play the game) but as a buy hold strategy for the 3 days while many individuals play the game is a must! If you enjoy day trading it these three are having 15-30% swings daily and you can take part in the game!

THESE ARE SOLELY STRATEGIES I USE IN THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKETS BY NO MEANS AM I TRYING TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVICE. I DO OWN SOME OF THE LISTED CURRENCIES FOR THE REASONS I’VE STATED.",2,2017-12-22 17:15:57,7

TRX,CryptoCurrencyTrading,TRX: MOMENTUM looks promising,"Looks like 2019 got off pretty decent for altcoins. TRX momentum looks promising, the current uptrend is minimal but worth attention. There is a net 3.5% gain in USD value, pushing the Tron price to $0.0206. There is also a 4.5% increase in the TRX/BTC ratio, 1TRX is 534 Satoshi at the time of writing ;) Both of these trends show promise for the future, assuming the momentum can be sustained in the coming hours and days. We do have a bullish price expectations now. Expecting  20% increase compared to its current BTC value. With a relatively high trading volume of nearly $120m, TRX looks pretty good and had a room for improvements. Will the TRX price stays uptrend for long? Only time will show.

TRX,CryptoCurrencyTrading,TRX is about to breakout,"TRX prices is struggling to break above 2.5 cents. This is now the main resistance level and round number meaning should traders muster enough momentum—spurred by technical or fundamental factors, then the resultant wave of higher high could propel TRX prices towards 4 cents as bulls begin recouping 2018 losses. In the meantime, TRX is up 3.1 percent in the last day and a massive 18.5 percent in the previous week at the time of press.

So far, TRX is up one spot to 10th flipping Cardano. With a market cap of $1.52 billion, we might expect a resurgent crypto market to lift TRX prices above 2.5 cents. From candlestick arrangement, this is likely to print out in the coming days because not only are transaction volumes increasing, and prices are edging higher confirming the double bar bull reversal pattern of December 2018.

Besides, after a brief correction early this month, prices reversed printing higher right off the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level. As such we expect TRX bulls to rally above 2.5 cents and because of this we recommend traders to buy at spot prices with stops at 2 cents.",0,2019-01-07 23:45:06,0

The bulls have been attempting to put a bottom in place for the past few months. The TRX/USD pair consolidated between $0.0183 and $0.0281551 for about three months, before breaking down on Nov. 19. An attempt to climb back into the range failed and the bears are attempting to extend the downtrend. The breakdown gives it a pattern target of $0.00844479. If the decline doesn’t stall at this level, then the next support is at $0.00554133.
However, if the bulls defend $0.01089965 and push the price back above $0.0183, the digital currency will indicate a probable trend change. Until then, every pullback will be met with a wave of selling, hence, it is better to wait and watch.",1,2018-12-17 21:53:59,0

TRX,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"BINANCE CONTESTS: WAVES, TNB, TRX (Demand Up, Supply Unchanged, Price UP ECON101)","BINANCE CONTESTS: WAVES, TNB, TRX 
Normally I solely do morning posts but today I noticed a few interesting things on Binance I wanted to share with the message boards. Binance is holding 3 contests, 2 based on trading volume and 1 based on accumulation. All 3 games/promotions will drive significant trading volume of their underlying coins, in turn driving the value of the specific coins higher for the next 3-10 days depending on the specific promotion. I think this is an ingenious way for Binance to get new traders involved while holding free promotions!

WAVES’s promotion is based on how much you buy and accumulate (sales and withdrawals are counted against you). With an airdrop coming at the end of the month and NG activation in 36 hours I expect the next 4 days to see significant upward trending price movement (prediction: 10% per day).

TRX and TNB’s promotion is based on total trading volume with the leaders approaching 1000BTC, but there are still plenty of prizes for smaller traders (sharing 4million TRX or 2million TNB for example). The sheer demand to exchange huge volumes to get more entries creates a game like atmosphere increasing the price for the next 4 days (only 4 days left in the promotion). I expect to see a nice price jump the next 48hrs. Not to mention it is down 40% from today’s highs to still be slightly up overall today (good time to get in).

If you need a referral link feel free to PM me. I think owning either of the three (not to play the game) but as a buy hold strategy for the 3 days while many individuals play the game is a must! If you enjoy day trading it these three are having 15-30% swings daily and you can take part in the game!

NXT is still vastly underpriced with the airdrop coming up and Bittrex supporting it. I expect Poloniex to come out and support it and another minimum of a 30% climb from NXT.

THESE ARE SOLELY STRATEGIES I USE IN THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKETS BY NO MEANS AM I TRYING TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVICE. I DO OWN SOME OF THE LISTED CURRENCIES FOR THE REASONS I’VE STATED.",2,2017-12-22 02:54:15,1

Asking since the cryptocurrency market has suffered several significant setbacks during 2022, but some of its assets have performed better than others, particularly in terms of returns per month, a new yearly report has revealed.  


Specifically, the top five best-performing assets in 2022 were TRX, XMR, BNB, ETC, and DOGE, as per the new ‘State of the Network’ report by the blockchain analytics platform CoinMetrics published on December 20.  


What is your plan for 2023, have you thought about some investment plans?  


People need to understand that DYOR is crucial even if you actually can never be absolutely sure in terms of crypto. I know it can be challenging for beginners but maybe projects like Coin Fantasy made the right decision in deciding to use games to introduce people to cryptocurrencies by creating the world's first decentralized fantasy trading platform for cryptocurrency markets for both new and experienced traders. This could help beginners enter the world of cryptocurrency.  


On the bottom of the chart, LUNA recorded a 100% loss of returns in May, after which the tracking stopped with the implosion of the Terraform Labs ecosystem that also led to the de-pegging of Terraform’s stablecoin TerraUSD.  


Another loser is FTT, the native token of the crypto exchange FTX, the collapse of which resonated across the crypto industry, culminating in the arrest of its founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. FTT suffered a 95% decline in returns in November, followed by a slowdown and a 22% drop in December.  


I found it pretty interesting that SOL found itself in the company of ‘losers’, recording a loss of 93%.",16,2022-12-23 18:50:08,8
TRX,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"December 23rd Topics: Technology Driven Week with Christmas Surprises (XVG, XEM, STRAT, ARDOR, NXT, MCO, PAY, BAY)","December 23rd Topics: Technology Driven Week with Christmas Surprises (XVG, XEM, STRAT, ARDOR, NXT, MCO, PAY, BAY)

NXT (will be in each post until the airdrop, went from $.9 yesterday when recommended to $1.70ish today), with the future value of airdrop priced this should trend toward $1.85.-$2.50. As I’m writing this I see it’s spiked over $1.60. That is almost 100% gains in 72 hours, I’ve been screaming to buy NXT in all of my prior posts. Today it popped, it should continue to trend toward $2.00. I just did the math on the IGNIS airdrop, the IGNIS has increased to $4.02 in value, meaning NXT should be worth a minimum of $2.00, a penny more for every penny NXT is worth following the airdrop, price point $2.00-$3.00 depending on if IGNIS continues to appreciates or not.

Technology: Nothing really creates 100% gains (or more) in the Crypto Markets better than technological block chain advances. This is the week’s leaders for this category…

XVG, VERGE WRAITH PROTCOL (XRG promises this to come out by end of year, plus a cool ad came out 4 days ago so I doubt they miss their deadline) anonymity with the flick of a button (public and private ledges in one block chain). XRG has promise WRAITH will be released by the end of this year, it should hit $1 when it does, McAfee although I don’t agree w/him on much he says, states $15 within 6 months of Wraith Protocol being released should be expected. I’m saying $1.00 it’s currently $.15 that’s a 600% upswing if I’m right, 6000% if McAfee is. Does it matter really who is at that point? Wrath allows the individual user to determine if they want they balance visible on the block chian or not. Right now we have coins like Monero which are completely anonymous hence their use on the dark web, or ones that are completely public where anyone who knows your wallet address can check your balance. XRG lets each user determine, public or private, this will revolutionize blockchian and altcoins.

XEM Catapult, which is version 2.0 of NEM (is to be released by the end of the year). Plus a 4 week hackathon beggning in January. There is nothing better to build awareness and test out their new Catapult network they’ll be releasing this week, then a worldwide hackathon and a new update to their NEM network.

STRAT, is going to have an amazing week. They promised that by January, ""I can confirm they will be able to host ICO's on our blockchain agnostic platform this year."" STRAT is on the cusp of being able to host ICO’s for other companies. This is extremely valuable technology and they’ve announced it will be ready to go this week. There should be anticipation, and extreme price growth once the tech is released.

ARDR, Platform launches Jan 1. Ardor’s blockchain becomes fully operational Jan 1st. Genesis snapshot announced 1 week in advance. Not to mention all those NXT you’ve been holding for the free IGNIS are used specifically on the ARDR block chain.

TRX: Promotion, Source code released on the 29th, open source platform. TRX has a promotion on Binance which drives significant trading. It is also in the Tech section because following the promotion I was expecting a drop in price, however, TRX has has their source code release on the 29th so even if there is a 1 or 2 day dip, it should explode upward on the 28th/29th.

CB Future Picks (same screenshot that showed BCC showed XRP and Monero). CB admits new coins will be added in the next few months. It was speculated in the online community that because CB released wallets for BCC, XRP, and Monero that those would be added next. CB adamantly denies that they planned to add BCC, XRP, and Monero. And then CB added BCC. I fully expect XRP and Monero to be added within 2 months, and that the original rumor they denied had some truth to it. XRP and Monero are buy and holds.

News this Week: MCO, has promised 3 surprises and a Christmas bonus. According to MCO, ""We have something special planned for all of you for December 25th and we think you will love it."" Their news cards are supposed to be released soon, maybe their debit cards (allowing you to exchange crypto for FIAT instantly) are ready! Check them out online they look GORGEOUS.

PAY & BAY (News and Surprises), Both have promised news on the 25th and given its Christmas I expect the announcements to be spectacular ones. Both have deadlines approaching for projects and I expect the announcements to either be completed projects ahead of deadlines or exciting new partnerships.

Binance Promo: TRX (real value in their code update on the 29th), price should dip after game concludes and then skyrocket after code update. TNB (garbage until Jan 11th) WAVES (different style promo, that gives entries based on accumulated WAVES).

Binance is holding 3 contests, 2 based on trading volume and 1 based on accumulation. All 3 games/promotions will drive significant trading volume of their underlying coins, in turn driving the value of the specific coins higher for the next 3-10 days depending on the specific promotion. I think this is an ingenious way for Binance to get new traders involved while holding free promotions!

WAVES’s promotion is based on how much you buy and accumulate (sales and withdrawals are counted against you). With an airdrop coming at the end of the month and NG activation yesterday I expect the next 4 days to see significant upward trending price movement (prediction: 10% per day).

TRX and TNB’s promotion is based on total trading volume with the leaders approaching 1000BTC, but there are still plenty of prizes for smaller traders (sharing 4million TRX or 2million TNB for example). The sheer demand to exchange huge volumes to get more entries creates a game like atmosphere increasing the price for the next 4 days (only 4 days left in the promotion). I expect to see a nice price jump the next 48hrs. Not to mention it is down 40% from today’s highs to still be slightly up overall today (good time to get in).

I think owning either of the three (not to play the game) but as a buy hold strategy for the 3 days while many individuals play the game is a must! If you enjoy day trading it these three are having 15-30% swings daily and you can take part in the game!

THESE ARE SOLELY STRATEGIES I USE IN THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKETS BY NO MEANS AM I TRYING TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVICE. I DO OWN SOME OF THE LISTED CURRENCIES FOR THE REASONS I’VE STATED.",27,2017-12-23 15:21:51,51

TRX,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"""Last Week's Crypto Buzz: Bitcoin Tops $24k, Twitter to Introduce Crypto Payments & TRX's 2023 Plans"""," A heated discussion is stirring on [r/crypto](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/) as Bitcoin hit the $24k mark, following a 25 basis point rate hike from the Fed. Meanwhile, Twitter is making headlines as reports suggest that the social media giant is looking to incorporate both fiat and cryptocurrency payments, with Elon Musk envisioning a ""super app"" future for the platform.

In the world of altcoins, Tron founder Justin Sun revealed his plans for 2023, with the goal of legalizing TRX in at least 5 countries. He encouraged the crypto community to expand their focus beyond just the US, as cryptocurrencies are rapidly gaining global adoption.

TRX,CryptoCurrencyTrading,eToro Staking - How to Earn Rewards for Holding Cryptocurrencies,"source: [https://sortter.com/blog/article/etoro-staking/](https://sortter.com/blog/article/etoro-staking/) 

**eToro offers a process known as staking on its platform. Staking allows traders who own certain cryptocurrency assets to earn rewards just by owning and holding certain crypto assets. eToro executes this process, meaning users can receive rewards on their crypto holdings the same way you can earn interest on your money. In this guide, we’ll explain how eToro staking works and all you need to know about it.**

## How Staking Works on eToro

Staking on eToro is an easy process that does not require you to monitor trades or perform any other action. All you need to do is to buy, own, and hold the supported crypto asset. eToro then pays the staking rewards monthly to users who qualify. 

The assets will belong to the user while eToro safeguards the staking procedure at no risk to the user. However, eToro charges a small part of the yield as payment for the technical, operational, and legal costs it accrues while staking. 

 The user will get a minimum of 75% of the yield.

## What Can You Stake?

eToro allows staking for assets such as Cardano (ADA), Tron (TRX), and Ethereum (ETH). However, ETH staking is only available to certain users. The rewards percentage available to a user depends on their membership level. 

For ADA, bronze members and all users in the United States will receive 75% of the monthly staking yield. Silver, Gold, and Platinum members will receive 85%, while Diamond and Platinum+ members will receive 90% of the monthly staking yield. 

There are 9 staking intro days for holding ADA and the rewards will start on the 10th day of holding the asset. Tron (TRX) also has the same reward percentage formula as ADA for its club members but with 7 staking intro days. 

The rewards begin on the 8th day. ETH staking also follows the same reward percentage. However, ETH staking will be locked until ETH 2.0 is launched. This means you’ll only have access to the rewards on the staked ETH when the ETH 2.0 blockchain goes live. 

It is important to note that certain users are not eligible to receive staking rewards. For ADA and TRX, users in the UK who signed up on eToro on or after February 8, 2022 are not eligible for staking rewards. 

UK residents who registered on or after February 1, 2022 are not eligible to receive staking rewards for ETH 2.0. Also, eToro staking does not apply to cryptocurrency assets that are held using copy trading, copy portfolios, CFDs, and short positions. 

### How Much Do You Need to Get Started?

eToro takes a daily snapshot of your holdings at 00:00 GMT. The total will then be divided by the number of days in the month and the result is used to calculate the average daily amount. The average daily amount will be used to calculate the monthly reward. 

The staking rewards will also be calculated using the applicable percentage of the user’s club membership. The minimum payable amount must be worth more than 1 USD in value. 

However, eToro pays staking rewards with the same crypto asset you stake. All staking rewards for a particular month will be paid within 14 days of the next month. All you need to do is to own and hold the supported crypto asset. 

The rewards will be shared automatically once they are available. eToro also provides an email containing the full details about the amount, the monthly yield, and a link containing the formula used for calculating eligibility, staking fees, and other necessary information. 

Remember to buy cryptos without using leverage. Otherwise, you'll only be purchasing crypto CFDs that don't give out any rewards. Moreover, you'll also be charged overnight [**fees on eToro**](https://sortter.com/blog/article/etoro-fees/).

## Conclusion

eToro allows users to grow their crypto assets just by owning and holding them. Provided that you meet the requirements, you can enjoy a hassle-free increase on your assets through staking. Alternately, you could store them in your [**eToro wallet**](https://sortter.com/blog/article/etoro-wallet/), but you won't be eligible for rewards.",6,2022-08-01 14:05:00,0

TRX,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"🍀 Ferox [$300k market cap only]🍀 Rising Star of DeFi, Seed Round with Spectacular Bonus Tiers, Be Your Own ""Tokenized"" Hedge Fund","**$FRX** (Ferox token) is the hidden gem you've all been waiting for from the recently reinvigorated Tron protocol with a state of the art ""**doxxed""** crypto team built around it.

Unique use cases with robust intrinsic utility backed by fiat derivatives trading dividends (please see WP for details) give FRX a peerless long term value proposition head and shoulders above the 99% of the meme coin craze going on these days.

Around 800 holders now, supply locked at 700 million, the low market cap is steadily increasing, this is as early as you can catch a true #MoonShot candidate before it reaches escape velocity 🚀.

Seed Round sells at a great discount vs the upcoming IDO which is scheduled to launch right after expansion to Binance Smart Chain, a very high probability play exists here for a minimum 12-15x which is frankly a conservative estimate comparing how well even anonymous and totally cloned IDO candidates have recently fared on BSC...

Just to be clear Tron Network has also invested a lot on launchpads recently, and there is a chance the IDO can occur on Tron too, which will lead to even faster price appreciation as FRX is a native TRC20.

For our extremely risk adverse investors who like to play a safe game, Central Exchange Listings also coming up and shortlisted for May.

Here is the landing page for the Seed Round, **we listened to the community and adjusted all the bonus tiers at a fixed USD amount after the powerful TRX rally;**

all you need is a Tron wallet that accepts TRC20 tokens to receive $FRX ( like TronLink or Trust Wallet ): 🏆 [**www.feroxadvisors.com/frx**](https://www.feroxadvisors.com/frx) 🏆

TRX,CryptoCurrencyTrading,MercadoLibre to Enable Crypto Trading via Its Digital Payments App,"Latin American e-commerce giant MercadoLibre is looking to allow its customers in Brazil to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrency.

**MercadoLibre to Initially Launch New Crypto Feature in Brazil**

According to [*Bloomberg*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-22/mercadolibre-to-allow-crypto-investments-through-digital-wallet) on Monday (Nov. 22, 2021), Brazilian customers who use MercadoPago, the digital payments app of MercadoLibre, will be able to trade and hold crypto assets using their digital wallets. 

The Vice President of MercadoPago, Tulio Oliveira, in an interview said that the company carried out research before deciding to go into cryptocurrency. Oliveira further said that “this has a transformational potential ahead and opens up a new avenue for us.”

Meanwhile, the MercadoPago executive said that for now, customers will not be able to make payment with crypto on the MercadoLibre platform. The feature was initially made available to a small group of users earlier in November, with the MercadoPago executive stating that there are plans for a broader launch in the coming weeks. 

Brazil has shown an open attitude towards cryptocurrency, with the country launching the first [Bitcoin](https://btcmanager.com/brazil-cvm-latin-america-first-bitcoin-etf/) and [Ethereum exchange-traded funds](https://btcmanager.com/brazilian-regulators-latin-america-ethereum-etf/) (ETFs) in Latin America. The result of a [survey](https://valorinveste.globo.com/google/amp/mercados/cripto/noticia/2021/09/10/para-48-pontos-percentuais-da-populao-brasil-deveria-adotar-o-bitcoin-como-moeda-oficial-diz-pesquisa.ghtml?__twitter_impression=true) published back in September showed that nearly 50 percent of Brazilians support the idea of having Bitcoin as the country’s official currency. 

MercadoLibre, however, is not new to cryptocurrency. Back in May, the company in an SEC filing, revealed that it had purchased $[7.8 million worth of Bitcoin](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001099590/000156276221000190/meli-20210505xex99_1.htm), stating that the investment was part of treasury strategy. Earlier, the e-commerce giant revealed that properties located in some parts of Argentina and listed on the platform can be [bought with BTC](https://www.mercadolibre.com.ar/institucional/comunicamos/noticias/propiedad-en-bitcoins-en-mercado-libre).

The company also organized a webinar at the time on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Interestingly, the CEO and co-founder of MercadoLibre, Marcos Galperin, has also been positive about the potential of crypto. Speaking to *Bloomberg* earlier in the year, Galperin said:

>“Crypto is going to be a major development. People are trying to retain value and some of the cryptocurrencies will retain value by definition because they cannot be printed away or devalued.”

Apart from MercadoLibre, similar companies have also offered support for cryptocurrency on their platforms. In August, major e-commerce platform Shopping.io partnered with Tron Foundation to add the TRX token as a payment option on the platform.

TRX,CryptoCurrencyTrading,The dVest Ecosystem,"The dVest Ecosystem' consists of the following dVest Labs projects:

dDEXX.io (the dVest DEX) is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) based Decentralized Exchange (DEX). dDEXX features easy and fast exchange functionality, profitable liquidity pools, and high APR yield farms, where users can earn dDEXX tokens, fees from exchange transactions, and much more. dVest.io (the dVest CEX) is the dVest centralized cryptocurrency exchange (CEX).

dVest CEX users can trade all popular cryptocurrencies include BTC, ETH, DVEST, CPI, LTC, UNI, DOGE, ADA, XRP, DOT, BCH, LINK, XLM, TRX, XMR, XTZ, and many more.

Crypto Price Index - the very first token ecosystem of its kind, which provides options for users to gain broad exposure to the cryptocurrency market through our ‘CPIx’ tokens. Unlike other indices of its kind, CPIx tokens are novel in their approach of showing token holders a diversified range of assets across a cross-section of the cryptocurrency markets. The CPI (CPI) flagship tokens are a governance token, used to represent an interest in the health of the CPIx token ecosystem. CPIx tokens are backed by component assets, held via an escrow smart contract, and each CPIx token holds the underlying assets which can be redeemed at anytime without third party involvement.

TRX,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Data from the top 20 fastest growing communities in crypto over the last month (X-post /r/CryptoCurrency),"Hey everyone, for the past couple months I have been working on a project called [Coinmunity](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinmunity-bitcoin-altcoin-app/id1322869245?mt=8). Coinmunity is an app that focuses on the growth of crypto communities, which in the market right now, has so much effect in driving price changes. Each day it tracks which coins have the combined highest % of growth in their Twitter and Reddit communities combined.

&nbsp;

Today, Coinmunity has now been live for one month, so I thought I would share what patterns I have personally picked out, having worked on the data, and observing the rankings during development and while live.

&nbsp;

What I have noticed is that you will see certain coins start to creep up higher and higher into the top 10 or 15 communities consistently before a price increase. The best example is TRX. You can see from this reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7k2c4g/congrats_rtronix_you_were_the_top_growing/) that I made 27 days ago, that /r/Tron had the top community while it was still at $.01 ( and it continues to consistently be in top 10 even now.) I think most of us can agree TRX has some big issues, but the point is that it’s very important to know which coins have the most eyes on them; because when people are watching a coin, they’ll usually buy it.

&nbsp;

**Here are the 20 coins with the most growth in their communities in the last 30 days:**

[#1 TRX](/r/Tronix) -  **Price Change:** +2664.018%, **Total Social Change:**+3904.851%

[#2 VEN](/r/Vechain) - **Price Change:** +709.507%, **Total Social Change:**+974.497%

[#3 XVG](/r/VergeCurrency) - **Price Change:** +2005.76%, **Total Social Change:**+925.614%

[#4 ADA](/r/Cardano) - **Price Change:** +467.414%, **Total Social Change:**+714.406%

[#5 FUN](/r/FunFairTech) - **Price Change:** +366.608%, **Total Social Change:**+611.430%

[#6 REQ](/r/RequestNetwork) - **Price Change:** +646.897%, **Total Social Change:**+607.782%

[#7 BNB](/r/Binance) - **Price Change:** +546.153%, **Total Social Change:**+ 558.920%

[#8 SUB](/r/SubstratumNetwork) - **Price Change:** +619.376%, **Total Social Change:**+501.659%

[#9 XLM](/r/Stellar) - **Price Change:** +249.216%, **Total Social Change:**+501.642%

[#10 ARN](/r/AeronAero) - **Price Change:** +1020.204%, **Total Social Change:**+469.129%

[#11 ENG](/r/EnigmaCatalyst) - **Price Change:** +1162.809%, **Total Social Change:**+427.344%

[#12 MANA](/r/Dencentraland) - **Price Change:** +236.856%, **Total Social Change:**+393.404%

[#13 XRP](/r/Ripple) - **Price Change:** +812.067%, **Total Social Change:**+389.193%

[#14 ETN](/r/Electroneum) - **Price Change:** +60.470%, **Total Social Change:**+366.755%

[#15 QSP](/r/Quantstamp) - **Price Change:** +518.553%, **Total Social Change:**+346.401%

[#16 SALT](/r/SaltTrader) - **Price Change:** +76.836%, **Total Social Change:**+331.701%

[#17 AST](/r/AirSwap) **Price Change:** +561.384%, **Total Social Change:**+272.433%

[#18 THC](/r/TheHempCoin) - **Price Change:** +711.952%, **Total Social Change:**+265.797%

[#19 NULS](/r/NulsService) - **Price Change:** +587.179%, **Total Social Change:**+234.036%

[#20 QASH](/r/LiquidQash) - **Price Change:** +104.2105%, **Total Social Change:**+208.4238%

*Total social change => reddit and twitter growth

&nbsp;

It probably wouldn’t be the best decision to buy a coin based off just community growth, so Coinmunity pulls each coin’s full subreddit to make it easy to quickly research the coin and see if there is any upcoming big news. 

&nbsp;

**Some upcoming features that we think will add value:**

* Google trends

* Marketcap and volume rankings

* Track personal investments

&nbsp;

If you have an android, the app is currently in development, but I have made a mobile friendly web app that is available at https://coinmunity.co! I will announce on the Coinmunity [twitter](https://twitter.com/coinmunityapp) when it is completed.

&nbsp;

As Coinmunity continues to grow, I will start to collect more and more data on social activity surrounding these coins, such as retweets,comments, upvotes, etc. One relationship that I am looking forward to explore is the amount of exchanges a coin is available on vs social growth vs price growth. I think there is a sweet-spot before a coin is widely enough available to experience huge price jumps, where it would be the best time to buy a coin. If this is something you guys are interested in please let me know and I will continue to post each month about further discoveries from the data!

Frustrated, he searched Google and found 1-800 number.  He called the number and a super helpful scam artist had him install a remote access application on his computer and proceeded to (with my friends help) log into Binance.  He then converted 100k coins of Tron over to BTC and then transferred it off BInance.

This particular friend spent the last several months transferring $20 at a time to build up to what he had, and let it go in a few minutes.  

He called me later in the day to tell me that someone helped him get verified and that he shouldn't have any more access problems, but that the person said he had to wait 24 hours before logging back in.  I realized something was wrong and had him log in, only to find that everything was gone.

I told him that since the guy basically used his computer to do all of this, there is probably nothing that could be done about it.

Please save me all the comments about how stupid could my friend possibly be.  And no, this is not a joke about my friend, he really exists and this really happened to him.

He has access to his account and can provide any information needed.

I think his coins are gone, what do you think?

UPDATE:  

This had nothing to do with Binance other than that is where he had his coins.  I did not mean to indicate that this was a failure on Binance.  This was pure social engineering that took advantage of someone recovering from some major health issues.  

I keep my coins on Binance.

TRX,Binance,Someone in Binance High Level Managment Wants to Hold the USDT-TRON Rewards Himself ???,"Recently, there is lots of news between Tether and TRON in the community. TRON based on Tether seems recognized by lots of exchanges, wallets and other platforms except Binance. Also there are lots of users committed to exchanging USDT-TRON to be early adopters and gain the rewards.

I am wondering, after USDT-TRON has been launched 1 week, why Binance, the top exchange worldwide hasn’t started support? Why Binance this time didn’t support Justin since they had BTT relationship? Is there any unspeakable reasons？My answer is definitely YES.

&#x200B;

**The ONLY reason I can think about that is because of the USDT-TRON early airdrop, someone in Binance high level management wants to hold the rewards in his own pocket behind CZ and Yi HE, and won’t give back to the users.**

&#x200B;

If indeed is this reason, some high level staff in Binance wants to hold by himself, users should be disappointed by the Binance choice of not supporting. Then can’t imagine that how many volumes Binance will lose! And there will be lots of users will withdraw their USDT to other exchanges like Huobi and OKEX to swap their USDT to TRON’s.

I think as one of the world’s leading centralized crypto exchanges, the most important for Binance to think about is to respect its users’ wills when they make some decisions since they have earned enough money from the community, it’s time to feed back and give some respect to the users.

&#x200B;

Let’s see some strong wills from the community.

In my opinion, Binance should support USDT-TRON as soon as possible, then all the users will catch up USDT-TRON rewards especially for all the institutional investors on Binance exchange. And also recommend that the managment level in Binance should focus on internal corruption if want to move forward in the future.

TRX,Binance,Tron Competition results,"Hey guys, 
Binance just distributed the prize for the second tron competition (trade at least 1 bitcoin's worth of tron in volume) 

I did that, and all I got for it is 149 tron. 



149 tron means there were 13,422 other people who traded at least 1 bitcoin's worth. 
I guess that's possible?

But like, I worked hard for a week, trading Tron, I've made over 250 transactions because I'm a small player and it took me a while to amass 1 bitcoin's worth of volume. 

And I also spent 1.67151683 BNB on fees from all those trades. 
That's like $10-$13 on fees and a week of grueling guerilla trading, haha. 
And not having my funds available for other trades.

149 tron is 4 dollars and 47 cents...

Feels bad man :(

TRX,Binance,HOW CAN I RETRIEVE ? If I SENT BNB COIN from my Binance Exchange Account to my Coinbase Wallet App and using the BEP20 NETWORK.,"So guys I am currently trying to figure this out. This simple mistake costs me major negativity in a lot of aspects of my LIFE. It sucks but mistakes do happen and when it does all you have to do is analyze it properly and know how you could learn from it. Also, you can try to find a way into fixing that mistake you made. Well, for me as you could see at the title of this post. I looked everywhere online but it seems like none of it works for my situation but most likely I am not doing it right. Anyway, I will type what exactly happened to me. First of I am a new account holder for Binance and I've always used Blockchain exchange or Coinbase exchange. So evening I decided to do a little Gamblin Session. I decided to try out this particular site my friend recommended to me. It was a cryptocurrency online casino. After signing up I decided to use my Binance account to deposit into the casino. Eventually after an hour or so I had won enough about 1600 USD but it was in the TRON cryptocurrency. I decided to withdraw 80% of it into my BINANCE exchange through the TRON address. I was able to do it without any problem. Now I converted all of my cryptocurrency into BNB coins including all of the other cryptos I had in my Binance account. I decided to transfer most of it, all of the total cryptocurrencies into my Coinbase wallet application. On my Coinbase wallet app, I searched for BNB and I saw BNB coin and pressed receive. I copied the address then finally went to my Binance app and initiated a withdrawal. Before I finalized the withdrawal I was at the part where there are different options to choose from of which network I wanted to use. Mistakenly I choose BEP20 as for the network. When the withdrawal was finalized I realized the mistake that I had made. I should have chosen the ERC20 network. To come to think of it I think that is a mistake also if I did such thing. Anyways, this was the mistake that I made. I need help with retrieving the funds. Please reply here or pm me. I am willing to send you some ETH for any person that can help me all the way. THANK  GUYS. The total BNB I currently lost is 828 BNB. Anyone who helps me with this can have 10 ETH.

TRX,Binance,What could happen to the BNB Token if the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Finds Binance Guilty?,"So news broke out a couple of hours ago that Binance is being examined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as to ""whether Binance’s initial coin offering of its Binance coin (BNB) token in 2017 was an unregistered security offering that should have been registered with the regulatory agency.""

There is also a report going around that the SEC is also probing the US division of Binance to ensure that it is appropriately differentiated from the global Binance body.

Although some individuals could tag this whole enquiry and probe as a mere witch hunt due to the fact that compared to networks like Cardano,  zetrix, tron, and even Solana,  BNBchain holds the binance Exchange which is accredited as the largest crypto exchange in the world.

Whichever direction it swings though, I'm certain these are pretty huge inquiries, and its outcome either Positive or Negative would affect the price value of BNB Token which is currently down by 4% since this news went public.",23,2022-06-07 19:24:29,33

Cannot sell it (not tradable), nor send it somewhere else (amount to small).

But I want to get rid of it, so I bought some APENFT (30USD) on Pancake and transferred it to the Binance wallet right after. Having enough to transfer it all off the exchange. But the funds never arrived.

Although like other blockchain networks such as Tron, Solana,  Zetrix and Cardano which host several dApps, the BNB Chain on which PancakeSwap is built is said to have grown to become the biggest dApp on BNB Chain having over 400,000 active daily users and so far also has the largest Total Value Locked.

So with this investment,  the price of $CAKE is reported to have risen by 10%, and who knows, this may just be the flight to the moon for $CAKE.

Guess this may also turn out to be a strong magnetic pull that would see many developers and projects build in BNBchain knowing for sure that funding and investment  may be readily available for them.",11,2022-06-06 18:45:46,23
TRX,Binance,This is why you should invest in Binance's BnB while it's still early. NOW is a great time to get involved.,"This is why you should invest in Binance's BnB while it's still early. Do your own research and you decide if it has the potential to take over the crypto exchange market. 

""CEO - Changpeng Zhao is a true visionary in cryptocurrency. Great pro-active team supported with Hongfei Da - Antshares/NEO CEO founder. Expect more developments on their platform in coming months. One of their edge is multi language platform (Eng, Japanese, Korean, Chinese) opening windows to asian traders which is a huge gigantic market. Check their official website & youtube team videos. With only 100,000,000 circulating supply, this coin will definitely have a decent market value."" -Xtian Est

I've done a tremendous amount of research since I've invested around the $.20 range and I've listed quite a few things you should take into consideration.

Use case #1:
Binance recently announced they're creating their own eco system for their very own high impact ICO Platform. These ICOs will be funded with BnB. This is smart because it attracts new users to join Binance and buy BnB. 
Check out TRON while you're at it https://www.binance.com/ico.html

Use case #2:
BnB will also serve as a gas on the decentralized exchange in the future. 

Use case #3:
BnB gives you a 50% discount on fees. You cut your trading fees in half while holding onto BnB. Here is the bonus, not only do you save in fees but you ALSO grow your capital as BnB rises in value. You are getting a two for one here! 

Use case #4:
Binance will buy back tokens from the open market and burn 100 million supply which will essentially drive the value up - supply and demand 101.  

Use case #5:
Binance has made a bold statement by stamping their name on the Binance BnB coin and making it the face of their company. This shows their confidence in the value of their product they are wanting consumers to buy and use. It is also my belief that the company's success or failure will reflect the market value of the coin. Binance will also add margin trading, futures, and additional utility to the BnB coin.

Funds Usage

● 35% of the funds will be used to build the Binance platform and perform upgrades to the system, which includes team recruiting, training, and the development budget.

● 50% will be used for Binance branding and marketing, including continuous promotion and education of Binance and blockchain innovations in industry mediums. A sufficient budget for various advertisement activities, to help Binance become popular among investors, and to attract active users to the platform.

● 15% will be kept in reserve to cope with any emergency or unexpected situation that might come up.

It is quite obvious that Binance plans to stay on top of their game. Marketing and growing the community is one of their main goals: https://binance.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000483751--Calling-for-Binance-Angels

Conclusion:
When was the last time you actually invested in an alt coin with intrinsic value that you could use on a live platform without investing into speculation? BnB is one of the few coins that has real usage and backed by an infrastructure that already supports the utility and value of it. 

Binance is changing the way traditional crypto exchanges have operated in the past. They GIVE BACK to their users and provide a sense of ownership. When was the last time you felt like you had a ""stake"" with an exchange? When was the last time you felt like you were surrounded by a team of members who genuinely cared about the community and made customer service their #1 priority? If you don't believe me come check out their slack channel and get to know the CEO @CZ Changpeng Zhao and awesome staff members ( u/steve_bnb ) who have been extremely helpful and quick to answer our questions. I could go on forever but it's clear that Binance is out to destroy their competition. 

Don't forget to look at their investors and the teams portfolio. Founders of NEO invested into Binance which is how they were able to quickly get NeoGas trading on their exchange (https://binance.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000608671-Binance-Open-Letter-to-NEO-Community). The founder and co-founder of Binance also came from OKCoin, one of the most successful bitcoin markets.

I want to send USDT from my Binance exchange Wallet to my Bitmart exchange wallet so that I can trade the USDT for AKT. (Akash Network) USDT is the trading pair for AKT on the Bitmart exchange.

 The address does not match the currently selected network, it is recommended that you switch to another network.

When I select Ethereum ERC-20 (ETH) I get the warning below: 

 Reminder: For the safety of your funds, please confirm again that the network you wish to use is ETH.

**Have you confirmed that the platform or application you are withdrawing to supports the BSC network?**

Yes, I have confirmed with them directly that they support the BSC network.  
No, I have not confirmed with them directly that they support the BSC network.

TRX,Binance,Better to own a few different coins or many coins?,"Hi Reddit,

I just started investing in crypto and kinda went overboard immediately. I now own 20 different coins, small ones and big ones. Is this a good approach or should I put my hopes on just a handful? All in all I have like $5k invested.

ETH, Cardano, stellar, 0x, district0x, DENT, TRON, numeraire, Polkadot, NUcypher, BAND, civic, ALGOrand, decentraland, CELO, Chainlink, uniswap, cartesi and BNB.

TRX,Binance,Binance has lost me thousands of dollars today. UPVOTE if this happened to you too.,"Today, literally anytime there came an important time to do anything. Buy TRON, sell BNB, buy/sell Bitcoin for USDT. The entire page locks up and I can't do a goddamned thing until the price point is far beyond where I want it. This will often persist for an hour or more at a time (or in the case of TRON, all day except for one break where the price was turning in the opposite direction), where the page just sits there with the fans whirring for no damned reason. I can't click anything, and worst of all, there is absolutely no other way to buy or sell. I just have to wait, and watch my wallets page as my hard earned funds diminish. 

I have a maxed-out 2015 MacBook Pro. So I know the issue is not my computer. I'm also experienced being a lead web developer for a leading news company in the US, and I know that there is no fucking reason for a page to be stalling like that on the front end. 

Binance needs to get some better programmers ASAP. ",19,2018-01-05 09:33:43,43
TRX,Binance,BNB analysis with real numbers,"Lots of chat about BNB atm...  So lets look at the numbers.

It has various utility, some short term, some medium, and who knows long term.

1) Right now = zero utility (as no fees on Binance)

2) 24th August = some utility (as fees come to Binance and you get 50% off when paying in BNB)

3) Some unknown time perhaps in 2017 = more utility (as Binance launch a 'decentralised exchanged' with BNB as the Gas, although i'm not quite sure what 'Gas' means in this respect)

4) Binance also want to use BNB to fund ICOs


So lets do some math.

TL;DR - BNB already has a utility value with TODAY'S UTILITY that justifies TODAY'S market cap of c. $200m.  Then it has several unproven (but high potential) products that could blow it upwards.

Right now BNB has a market cap of roughly $200m, it's pretty simple, there are 100m tokens and $2 per token.  There are no hidden tokens, no extra ones to come, it's really vanilla (yes there are 100m tokens for Binance i.e. the founders, but these are locked up for 4 years).

Right now Binance.com has a daily volume of $150m.  Bear in mind that it didn't exist very long ago, and this volume has been growing very quickly.  Exchanges like Bittrex/Polo do c. $500m / day or so.  Bithumb is doing $1B+ right now due to the BTC/BCH stuff...

So on today's volumes, Binance should make $150m * 0.1% in fees = $150k / day (of course it's zero fees right now, but that is irrelevant in the longer term as that changes next week).

Now, there is pretty much zero reason to not use BNB to pay for fees, you can just buy a small amount and use it for fee reduction after all.  But not 100% of people will use it, it's never 100%.  Lets assume 50% for the sake of an assumption that is likely a bit conservative.

That means Binance.com users will be saying about $150k * 50% * 50% = $37.5k / day of fees.

Now, Binance will grow in volume almost certainly, and lets say it gets to about 3x it's current volume (putting it close to Bittrex, and Polo), then users are saving $100k / day in fees by using Binance.

That is $35m / year of savings.

Using a 'normal' (whatever that means!) P/E multiple of 10x, means that has a value of $35m * 10 = $350m.

So the value of Binance for JUST FEE REDUCTION is about $350m.  Although due to the schedule of reducing the fee discounts, one could argue this is a lower number by quite a lot.  So lets say $100-200m.

This is exactly it's current market cap.  So it's current market cap actually SEEMS SENSIBLE!!!!!

WOW, a crypto that has actual UTILITY value, where one can do actual math to work out a vaguely accurate (or not!) market cap.  Remember most crypto's have zero utility value right now, they are dreams :)

So after this Binance will launch a 'decentralised exchange' where BNB will be a 'core part of', where some people have said it will be the 'gas' for the exchange (I don't think this is like Gas as in ETH Gas, or indeed NEO and GAS, I have no idea what it is really, however I suspect it will enable the exchange to act as a DAO, i.e. it lubricates the decentralisation, keeps it in sync etc etc (if you have any ideas let me know!), and so this should add further value to BNB.  Who knows what, but something.

Binance also say that BNB will be used for ICOs too, e.g. Tron, and some others that are listed already on Binance.com.  This is like NEO, and also ETH (and BTC obviously).

So this should drive demand one would think.

Oh and Binance said they will buy back half the tokens over time (as they make profit), so that in-effect doubles the market cap on a per token level (i.e. justifies double the current price, not double tho as Binance is not profitable yet, but if they are a large exchange they will be)

TL;DR - BNB already has a utility value with TODAY'S UTILITY that justifies TODAY'S market cap of c. $200m.  Then it has several unproven (but high potential) products that could blow it upwards.

Therefore my point is that it's a great buy, and a classic HODL :)

TRX,Binance,The CryptoQuestion December Bulletin - Important news roundup and free crypto resources for your listening and viewing pleasure,"**About us: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

**Trending**

**The metaverse is everywhere**

It seems that the crypto community is way ahead of the curve. Nothing new there. Facebook announced that they had changed their name to Meta to reflect their focus on the metaverse. Whilst blockchain entrepreneurs have been developing metaverse applications for a few years now Facebook gave it mainstream recognition. Before that announcement the average person hadn't even heard of the metaverse and if they had they didn't have a clue what it meant.

Here is a brief definition for those in the metaverse beginner camp:

A shared, realistic, and immersive computer simulation of the real world or other possible worlds, in which people participate as digital avatars.

Investors are piling into cryptocurrencies which have even a faint connection to the metaverse.

The top 5 cryptos in the metaverse space are:

Axie Infinity $7.0bn

Decentraland $5.0bn

The Sandbox $5.1bn

Enjin Coin $2.9bn

Illuvium $0.8bn

A few long shots worth a closer look:

Somnium $0.2bn

Rentible $7m

The metaverse is an interesting concept to investigate, from an investors point of view anyway. There are two plays. The first is investing in the cryptocurrency and the second is buying land. Let’s take Decentraland for instance. Its fully diluted market cap of $10 billion is priced to perfection. In other words, the valuation already assumes they will be a leading player in this market going forward. And that thinking is also priced into the value of their virtual land which is selling for up to millions of dollars.

Virtual land is like real estate. It is in finite supply with location playing an important role in its value. Canny investors are buying up virtual land plots on various metaverses expecting to either develop it, rent it or flip it.

The metaverse is set to be part of our future. However, a few words of warning. Don't go rushing out to buy the next shiny metaverse project. 99.9% of the new projects coming to market will fail. Also remember, buying virtual land comes with risk. Like buying land in the real world, if you purchase a plot within a metaverse where there are few visitors your land will have as much value as buying land in the middle of the Sahara.

**dYdX and the perpetual**

Let’s start with, what is a perpetual?

A perpetual swap is something similar to a futures contract. The core difference is that perpetuals do not have expiration dates.

dYdX’s perpetuals have proved so popular that they have eclipsed Coinbase in daily volumes. It achieved this by solely offering perpetual for four assets. dYdX is now one of the most liquid exchanges in crypto.

**Rapid fire**

The influential FATF (Financial Action Task Force) **wants governments to hold the people behind DeFi protocols accountable**. This will send the shivers down the backs of the many platforms that have decided on anonymity. This proposal is not likely to come in for some time, but it is something that we can see being implemented and enforced ruthlessly.

Muslim leaders have warned their flock that **crypto is forbidden**. According to these well-informed individuals, ‘it has elements of uncertainty, wagering, and harm’.

Binance CEO announced that he intends to **give away up to 99% of his wealth**. No doubt this raised the eyebrows of US authorities who will be eyeing much of his wealth for themselves!

Binance made **Know Your Customer (KYC) mandatory** for global users in their effort to make Binance a regulatory compliant business.

In another attack on the DeFi space. BlockFi, which offers high interest rates to investors, is being **investigated by the SEC**. The SEC considers that BlockFi’s interest accounts represent the offering of unregistered securities, something that no doubt the SEC will use to target many other high profile yield farming platforms in the near future.

Cardano the blockchain platform has **achieved over 20 million transactions worth over $18 billion**. That figure is only slightly lower than that of Bitcoin and compares to Ethereum’s $9 billion. The price of ADA however is in the doldrums with many complaining of the lack of DAPPs because of its complex programming language.

eToro announced it was **delisting Cardano and TRON** by the end of the year for US customers as it believes these coins could represent securities.

**Staking and Yield Farming**

Each week we provide the latest APRs from leading staking and yield farming platforms together with news from the industry.

Staking and yield farming has been a major driver in the huge growth in the DeFi sector. Investors are being enticed by the massive APRs on offer. Totally new projects tempting investors with returns of 10,000+ % are able to attract a deluge of money from investors who don’t seem concerned with the high risks involved. Our weekly review looks at the best platforms out there and the ones to avoid. We attempt to weed out the platforms that we think won’t stand the test of time.

**Catchy by name Catchy by nature**

A tracker wallet that has to be tried to be appreciated!

Tired of manually adding token addresses to Trustwallet? Tired of seeing out-of-date and inaccurate balances? Tired of switching apps to check on your multiple wallets? We present CATCHY, an innovative solution that facilitates wallet tracking, implemented directly on Telegram, the flagship crypto platform. CATCHY aims to provide a suite of crypto tracking tools for Telegram users. From the currently available multichain (BSC + ETH) Telegram wallet tracker, to the upcoming whale watcher, price alert, and sniper bot tools, our vision is to create an ecosystem that satisfies all crypto enthusiast needs. Today, we’ll give a small overview of our multi chain wallet tracker and the many useful features it has to offer.

Our Telegram wallet tracker is made with both accessibility and convenience in mind. Simply talk to one of our tracker bots (found in our Telegram group [CATCHYTOKEN](https://t.me/CATCHYTOKEN)), and it will direct you to the tracker bot you were specifically assigned to. From there on out, you’ll only use one command: /wallet. On your first use, the bot will notify you that you haven’t added any wallet addresses to the tracker and will ask you about the blockchain you wish to use. Keep in mind that you can add up to 3 wallets at any time, and they can belong to different blockchains, so your choice here isn’t final. Reply to the tracker bot’s message with a wallet address of your choosing, and you’re good to go!

Note that the tracker DOES NOT require a wallet connection, making it the absolute safest option to keep tabs on your balances. The tracker can never be linked back to your person either, as it relies on an anonymous numerical ID that is unique to each individual. The bot you were assigned to will remember you through that ID, so you’ll never have to go through the setup process again.

After you’re done with the first step, the tracker will immediately attempt to fetch your wallet balances based on publicly available data. Just wait a couple seconds and VOILA: the balance of every token in your wallet, valued in USD and BNB/ETH (depending on the chain), ranked by value. These values are the most up-to-date balances you can fetch, as they rely on the BSC and ETH blockchains directly instead of waiting for other services to supply prices (like Trustwallet for example). From this point onwards, you’ll rarely ever need to use /wallet again, as the buttons supplied under your balance sheet are more than enough to satisfy any needs you might have.

The \[Refresh\] button immediately updates your balances, the \[Gains\] button enables percentage gain calculation from the last time you pressed \[Refresh\], the \[MC\] button adds the market cap of every token directly into the balance sheet, and the \[Charts\] button offers immediate access to the charts of your tokens. The \[Manage\] button allows you to add wallets (up to 3) or remove existing ones, as well as play around with language settings (English and Chinese are available at the moment).

At CATCHY, your convenience is our utmost priority, and we hope that is reflected in the intuitive design of our tracker and its ease of use. However, our most convenient feature is one that you’ll rarely ever notice: Scam/Dead token filtering. Unlike sites like poocoin, where you have to manually hide dust and dead tokens, our tracker automatically does that for you by employing our own filtering system. And if our system oversteps its boundaries, you can use the \[Show Missing & Hide Existing Tokens\] button to take full control of your tracker’s output. These choices will be saved forever, so you’ll never have to reconfigure your balance sheet.

Our tracker strikes a delicate balance between convenience and complexity, offering you extensive control of what you see without sacrificing simplicity and accessibility. The tracker is currently free for users to try and explore, but in the near future, you will have to hold CATCHY to make use of its features, making it the first of many use cases that are coming down the line. Please visit our website [https://catchy.finance/](https://catchy.finance/) for further details on the tracker and other products currently in the works.

TRX,Binance,Lost my BTT tokens and no reply from binance chat,"So, due to my own stupidity I sent BTT tokens over the TRC10 network to my Binance wallet. Seeing as binance only supports TRC20, I cannot see the coins in my wallet (using a watch wallet confirms that they are actually in the wallet, just not visible because of binance not supporting the network). 

I have used the chat and was able to get a conversation going with someone who told me that it could be fixed, but for that to work, I had to apply for retrieval. The CS employee told me that I should contact him again through chat if the application was denied (which it was, because the transaction could not be found on the TRC20 network). After this, it was impossible for me to get someone to speak to on the chat. I've waited for several days now and i'm getting quite anxious...

It should not be so hard to just send back the coins, or make a smart contract for them to turn up in the TRC20 wallet, right? Not trying to whine - I know it is my own fault, but I am getting the feeling i'm being ghosted here...",4,2021-04-02 10:21:55,11

All the rare Chinese coins not listed or available for trading on any other English websites seem like junk, and have tanked severely since being introduced.  It's impossible to find any reliable information on what these coins do and their circulating supply, or even what price they are trading for on other exchanges.  The Tron ICO seems like a giant scam and I hear it's also going to have close to a 100 billion supply and uncapped, it makes you wonder if they are selling to their friends on other Chinese websites at a discount to what we are paying.  I have the same fear about the upcoming LLT ICO since it seems Binance is only handling a small percentage of it, and there is also no information available.  I'm getting a strong feeling that this site is just trying to exit scam westerners as much as possible for high ranking Chinese crypto developers before people catch on.

TRX,Binance,Transferring USDT from Binance.us to Gate.io,"As the title implies, I'm trying to move USDT from Binance.us to Gate.io.  The US version of Binance appears to only offer 2 transfer networks for USDT: The expensive ERC20 network at $25 per transfer, or the much cheaper BEP2 network at $.025 per transfer.  Obviously my preference would be to use BEP2, except Gate.io doesn't have that option on the receiving end.  Gate.io has BTC/OMNI, ETH/ERC20, TRON/TRC20, BSC/BEP-20, EOS, Heco and Solana.  

Is there another known way in which I can use the BEP2 network - perhaps transferring the USDT to a wallet or a secondary exchange, and then doing a second transfer from said wallet or exchange to Gate.io?

TRX,Binance,"Hi, I have bought some USDT on Binance and I need to send 100 USDT to someone's wallet, but the gas fee is 20USDT if I chose ETH chain, is there any way I can send the USDT to his wallet in the cheapest way?",,1,2021-03-19 11:00:04,6
TRX,Binance,Stablecoin Market Trends and Report,"In terms of overall market capitalisation for stablecoins, we have seen high demand and tremendous growth in the space due to the importance of the role played by stablecoins in DeFi. In Q2 2021, $BUSD experienced the largest growth in its market cap. This is likely due to the influx of users to the Binance Smart Chain due to high gas fees and network congestion on the Ethereum platform in Q1 2021. We take a closer look at the top 5 stablecoins by their market capitalisation.

&#x200B;

The top 5 stablecoin by market cap are $USDT, $USDC, $BUSD, $DAI and $UST respectively. The first 3 stablecoins are generally similar in that they are a form of fiat-collateralised stablecoin and have a centralised backing. The latter 2 stablecoins are a form of crypto-collateralised pegged stablecoin and are also considered to be decentralised.

&#x200B;

Tether ($USDT) remains the most adopted stablecoin in circulation. For the case of $USDT, Tether Limited claims to back $1 worth of Tether for every $1 of USD, although there have been some controversies regarding this claim. As of July 2021, Tether executives are under federal investigation. The market cap for $USDT started to flatten in Jun 2021, but nevertheless recorded growth of 54% in Q2 2021.

&#x200B;

USD Coin or $USDC is the 2nd largest stablecoin by market capitalisation. $USDC is governed by Centre, a membership-based consortium that sets technical, policy and financial standards for stablecoins. $USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions, backed by fully reserved assets and is redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars according to Centre. In contrast with the decline in Tether's growth, we see a corresponding increase in $USDC's market capitalisation. $USDC market cap increased by a whopping 133% in Q2 2021, in comparison to Tether's 54%.

&#x200B;

Binance USD (BUSD) is the 3rd largest stablecoin by market capitalisation and is similarly a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin issued by Binance (in partnership with Paxos), and is approved and regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). $BUSD is used in the Binance Smart Chain and has also seen an uptrend in its market cap.

&#x200B;

$DAI uses an over-collateralised mechanism to maintain a $1 peg of $DAI to USD. Unlike the 3 aforementioned stablecoins, $DAI is a form of crypto-collateralised pegged stablecoin and is decentralised. However, much of what collateralises $DAI involves $USDC. Critics argue this means that $DAI is backed by a centralised entity, making it susceptible to centralisation risks like the 3 stablecoins described above.

&#x200B;

$UST is the stablecoin used within the Terra ecosystem. The $LUNA token in Terra is used to support the $UST stablecoin peg. The market cap of $UST is relatively small compared to the top stablecoins because $UST is not widely used in other blockchains but only has utility within the Terra ecosystems in protocols such as Mirror and Anchor.

&#x200B;

Algorithmic stablecoins are starting to develop this year but overall there are not too many outstanding projects. Stablecoins under the Rebase/Seignorage type models have not really performed in terms of maintaining their peg. Most of them have been priced below the peg price for a long time despite measures of price equalisation such as $ESD, $DSD and $BAC.

&#x200B;

$FRAX, $UST and $sUSD are stablecoins with pretty good performance when it comes to keeping relative stability against the 1 US dollar. However, $AMPL, although dynamic around $1, has a very large fluctuation.

&#x200B;

Stablecoin Supply Ratio

Cryptoquant recorded an ATL for the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR), which measures $BTC market capitalisation relative to the total stablecoin supply to estimate purchasing power in the stablecoin market. Accordingly, when the price of $BTC falls, the amount of stablecoin purchases will increase to push the price of $BTC up and vice versa. But the growth of stablecoin supply in the spring of 2020 and 2021 has kept SSR near historic lows. This shows that demand for $USDT seems to keep pace with the demand for $BTC

&#x200B;

Popular Stablecoins

Stablecoins were born with the noble function of resisting the strong volatility of other cryptos. However, not all efforts have been fruitful.

&#x200B;

Stablecoins are now being used to exchange and pay more frequently than $BTC and $ETH . Velocity measures the rate of average trading volume against the market capitalisation.

&#x200B;

A high velocity means that the cryptocurrency is widely traded within the economy.

&#x200B;

$USDT and $BUSD have the highest speed, ranging from 1.0 to 3.0. Given the dominance of Binance as the top exchange and the rise of its blockchain (BSC), it is no surprise that $BUSD is being most widely used after $USDT.

&#x200B;

According to statistics, Ethereum is still the top blockchain, accounting for more than 70% of stablecoins in the market as of January 2021. Tron, Omni, and Terra are next — proving that the stablecoin market is very active and the algo-stablecoin space is growing beyond just $UST.",2,2021-09-23 23:47:33,2

TRX,Binance,Exploits / LP attacks! on BSCscan DISCOVERED! sensitive info that might aid other investors/projects on BSCscan," 

Apparently, some wallets can make a chain of transaction events, that eventually ""steals"" LP-CAKE from token owners who are trying to inject liquidity into their pools, or in some cases, make a buy-sell of LP-CAKE that increases their value without any reason.

The most amazing thing is, that this type of hack is ""bending"" the rules of the blockchain, by using exploit / LP attack and making a chain of transactions, usually at the same block, where they buy LP-CAKE and selling back at much higher value after a very short time.

As far as it seems, the exploit / LP attack happens through the BSCscan network - unrelated to any token's code or function. As far as we noticed, they attacked much bigger projects. Last example we found was Tron(TRX)

TX: [https://bscscan.com/tx/0xa7af78ed9ce9354acaaccfdf5a9fc076f2c53ed6f5970daa031cc2bf1d2fcaa3](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xa7af78ed9ce9354acaaccfdf5a9fc076f2c53ed6f5970daa031cc2bf1d2fcaa3)

In another case, the first wallet (Ends with A9) just recently attacked from another new and interesting project : Baby Doge Coin.

Zooming in a bit more and we can find a weird CAKE-LP transaction, increasing the worth of the BNB deposited for the transaction and send it back to the original wallet:

[https://bscscan.com/tx/0xa66422aaffcf6dc5b3a54ce29e1d4b33d7773e7240d5d65e7c2feac02635fab8](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xa66422aaffcf6dc5b3a54ce29e1d4b33d7773e7240d5d65e7c2feac02635fab8)

Less than 24 hours ago, the same wallet made another weird movement, again with LP-CAKE from Baby Doge Coin:

We found those wallets working together according to the time frames they attacked other tokens, and the fact that in some cases, they were able to make actions together at the same block.

We made a small first injection, and when we noticed this anomaly, we started to investigate it, finally arriving at some conclusions about how to make future injections safer.

While analysing our transactions, we also reviewed our code and its functions for any anomalies that might effect the security and we're happy to say it turned out completely secure and unaffected by this incident.

If it's all true, it doesn’t look like there is a way to stop those CAKE-LP attacks, and it seems that the entire BSCscan network is exposed to those cases.

Token owners - make sure to check your LP tokens after liquidity injections and monitor your LP-CAKE contract for any similar transaction as we mentioned.

Our team has sent an e-mail to BSC Scan regarding this issue and we await their reply.

Wishing you all safe swapping!

TRX,Binance,"BEP2, BEP20, ERC20, OMNI & TRC20 networks – What’s the difference?","BEP-2 | ERC-20 |TRC-20 | OMNI

A year ago when Binance launched Binance chain they also announced a feature that allows interoperable deposits and withdrawals. Meaning you can deposit an ERC-20 Token to your Binance account and withdraw as BEP-2 Token and vice versa.

For example you can deposit Chain Link or Matic which is an ERC20 token (from Ethereum Chain) to your Binance account and withdraw them as BEP2 token (to Binance Chain).

However the address for both the network is different.

BEP2 – Token on Binance chain starts with bnb136ns6lfw4zs5hg4n85vdthaad7hq5m4gtkgf23

ERC20 – Token on Ethereum chain starts with 0x0e806cea8e5beba6df97354ef7f22b66c5a2ce82

Likewise the address for OMNI and TRC20 is also different.

OMNI – Token on Omni layer network starts with 1JKhrVV9EsgSS5crXLBo9BRVXyuHjf2Tcp

TRC20 is a token standard on TRON network and their address starts with TWsVAb9EWAgKdumTD7XoEdkvs7AoyvkgN7

Also BEP-2 address requires the use of MEMO which is not needed for OMNI, TRC20 or ERC-20 deposits and withdrawals. So there shouldn’t much confusion when depositing or withdrawing your tokens.

Even when you input the wrong address the exchange will warn you with the following message.

“The address does not match the currently selected network, it is recommended that you switch to another network.”

Likewise when you are sending coins / tokens from your wallet you’ll get “Recipient address is invalid” error message if you input an incorrect address.

But now things got little confusing for many newbies after Binance launched BSC (Binance Smart Chain) and opened deposit and withdrawal option for BEP20 tokens.

BEP 20 Token

BEP 20 option is now available for major assets like BTC, ETH, USDT, LINK, DOT, DAI, EOS, LTC, XRP, XTZ, BCH, BAND, ADA, ONT etc.

So now when you are depositing or withdrawing any of these coins you’ll be asked to choose the network type.

Once you input your wallet address or the recipients address for withdrawal the exchange will automatically select the network based on the address entered.

But what’s more confusing is that both BEP 20 and ERC 20 share the same address format. Also they’ve listed ETH as ERC20. Hope Binance changes this soon to avoid confusion.

(ETH is neither ERC20, BEP2 or BEP20. ETH is a native coin on its own chain. ERC 20 is a token on ETH chain and BEP 2, BEP 20 is a token on Binance chain and Binance smart chain respectively)

So what is the difference between these two networks, why BEP 20 uses same address as ERC 20 and which one should I choose when transferring ETH or other coins?

Here we’ll not get into the technical specifications of the token standard. Instead we’ll just explain the basics of these network types and give a quick introduction to pegged tokens.

BEP20 Network – Binance smart chain

Binance smart chain is a parallel Binance chain designed to enable smart contracts and it comes with an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible environment.

It is never meant to compete with Ethereum or replace ETH. BSC is just an ETH-compatible chain and is designed to give users more options such as fast block times, cheap transaction costs etc.

Users will now be able to transfer the same asset (ERC20 token) in shorter time and at surprisingly low cost (low gas price) on Binance smart chain (BEP20 token). These are called pegged tokens.

Pegged tokens?

Pegged tokens are a type of token that will have its value tied to the original crypto.

For example Chain Link (ERC-20) token will be pegged at 1:1 ratio with Chain Link (BEP-20) token. Not only ERC 20 tokens, but even tokenized versions of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tether (USDT)  are available on Binance smart chain.

The purpose of these tokens is to allow trading assets on DEXs and benefit from the speed and transactional efficiency of the new blockchain.

These coins and tokens are wrapped and pegged by Binance on 1:1 ratio to the corresponding native cryptocurrency.

On Binance scan explorer you can find the full list of Binance pegged tokens (BEP 20) and their contract address.

Bsc Scan: https://bscscan.com/tokens/label/binance-pegged


These tokens are currently traded on Binance and  Binance DEX. You can transfer to and from Binance.com and can swap it for their native assets anytime.

Also Trust wallet is the only wallet that currently supports BEP20 token standards. Other than that you can enable Binance smart chain on your Metamask wallet which we’ll explain in another guide.

What is the difference between BEP-2, BEP-20 and ERC-20?

Most of the popular tokens today are ERC 20 tokens that are build on Ethereum. If you are quite confused then visit CoinMarketCap and you should be able to figure out whether a token is built on Ethereum blockchain or Binance chain.


ERC-20 is a technical standard for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for tokens.

BEP-2 is a technical standard for implementing and launching tokens on the Binance blockchain.

BEP 20 represents a token standard on Binance smart chain.

This is all you need to understand:

ERC20 – Ethereum chain

BEP 2 – Binance chain.

BEP 20 – Binance smart chain

For example if you choose BEP 20 as network and withdraw your ERC 20 token then the tx will be visible on Bsc scan and not Etherscan. It’s because you withdrew it to Binance chain and not Ethereum chain.

So when depositing or withdrawing make sure to choose the right intended network. Ensure that you use the correct chain that the platform supports.

If you require assistance or quite confused then we recommend you to contact Binance support.

Hope it helps.

TRX,Binance,"""Account at risk...""","Hi everyone,

Today I wanted to withdraw 3.1 Dots to a hardware wallet and run into the "" Your account may be at risk and thus we are temporarily suspending your withdrawals."" problem. The link to ""Appeal now"" seems to be useless as it just stated "" Your appeal for withdraw does not meet the requirements."" without any further information.

The account is a few years old, is verified, and has a balance of a few thousand dollars. It didn't had any activity the last 2 or 3 years until mid February when I started to make several (3 at all) fiat deposits and bought some cryptos.

During the withdraw process I confirmed the codes they sent via SMS and mail. I wasn't concerned in the beginning until I digged a bit deeper and found a lot of similar problems within this subreddit.

I'm not even able to submit a ticket (where to do that?) and I'm currently in the ""live chat"" at position 11k. The bot is saying leave a detailed message and some kind of human will contact me via mail... but from what I've seen here this will took ages.

Do you guys have any ideas on what to do? For any quick solution on this I'll drop you some silly Tron... ;)

TRX,Binance,Help me with my doubts at TRX,"First, please excuse my language, English is not my native language.

I really like Tron (TRX) and today I bought 10k TRX (for $488 USD). Now there are some things which bother me and those are also the reason why I only bought 10k TRX yet.

First thing is, that Tron calls itself a ""democracy"" but as far as I understand, a democracy handles each member equal. The vote power of Tron members is dependent from their amount of TRX as far as I understand and this is for me the exact opposite of a ""democracy"". Especially because Binance owns something around 55% of all TRX.

Second thing is, that there is no total limitation of coins. I don't see a problem with that, but currently I feel like that there are more TRX produced than burned which leads to inflation. I don't even have a problem with having an inflation. Actually it's pretty clever to have some control over the value of the coins. But it bothers me that newly created coins are distrubuted to their creators. This will finally lead into the same economic problems, the whole world is suffering from, right now. Rich people getting richer without doing anything helpful for mankind and poor people losing all their posessions due to growing depts,  although they are doing importand things for mankind.

In Tron this will be exactly the same: Big TRX holders like the Tron Foundation itsself or Binance will just hold their TRX and generate huge passive income just from validating transactions, while content creators and other Tron members will see how life in Tron's ecosystem becomes more and more expensive.

What are your thoughts about this?",1,2021-02-11 17:35:39,0

TRX,Binance,"placed 2nd in trx competition, but something seems fishy about first place.","For the first 3 days the first 3 places all had between 850-960 btc in volume, and I was in third. I managed to triple my volume for the last 3 days and then the daily updates suddenly stop working. finally I can see the update hours after the competition ends and somehow zh*** beat me by 100 btc out of 3.4k. I don’t even remember this person being in the top 3 before. Is this a real person who happened to not do much the first 3 days and then suddenly win AND barely beat me by 3% or is something fishy here?

If it’s a real person, it also seems weird that he came out of nowhere to take first if he didn’t wash trade. I wonder if this can be investigated. I traded legit with just my single account so i’m kinda salty as I could have easily made a few hundred more btc volume if the updater showed me progress in the last three days

TRX,Binance,"How to buy XRP, TRX, or many other alt coins on Binance","Hello, crypto's lovers. The following will help you buy XRP, or many other altcoins fairly quick and painlessly. As a reminder, this is a simple guide for newbies that want to get a quick piece of the action. There are many other ways, and this is one that worked for me.

1) Click this link and watch a 3 min video on how to create a coin base account. The video is not mine, but Nathan Scaglione did a great job.
https://youtu.be/LvFcwYX4moU

2) Open an account at https://www.coinbase.com/

3) Buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin (my favorite)

4) Open a Binance account at https://www.binance.com/?ref=10987182
P.S. This is my ref link above click if you want to help me out, if not click one below.

5) Send your coin of choice from Coinbase, which you bought in step 3 to Binance. A) Log onto www.Binance.com, clink the funds tab at the top of Binance webpage and select withdraw deposit. B) Find Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin (whatever you bought) and click on deposit. C) Click on QR code and a QR picture will pop up. D) Open the Coinbase app available on Apple and Google store. E) Sign in and click accounts bottom middle of app, click the coin you bought, and click on the white arrow in the upper right of the app. F) Type in amount of coin you would like to send I.E .01 BTC, click send G) Click QR picture in top right and scan QR code from www.Binance.com and click send.

6) Now that might seem like a lot but it is really easy after you complete your first transfer. Click the funds tab again and go to history. After about a minute (longer if you used bitcoin) you will see your transfer coming in. After the transfer gets 6/6 confirmation you will have your coin in your account.

7) If you bought bitcoin you are good to go! just selected exchange tab then click on basic, type XRP in the search bar on the right side of the webpage. It will pop up, click it, find the big green buy xrp and place your order.

8) If you bought Litecoin from coin base it the same but you need to sale your Litecoin for Bitcoin first.
Well, thats it! Again there are many other ways to buy XRP, and other Alt coins but this way worked for me. Binance has very low transaction fee's, simple to use, and has a ton of alt coins to choose from, and can be set up with Google authenticator for added security. Thanks, all hope this helped.",4,2017-11-28 07:24:15,11

-----UPDATE------
I managed to solve the problem! If anyone has the same issue there is a way to retrieve your TRX.  You must add a custom token to your wallet through MEW.  You need to know the amount of TRX you have, the contract number and the decimal number and indicate it as a custom token.  It will then appear in your wallet, however still with a value of 0$.  Dont panic. Send the balance of TRX to Binance and they will still convert your TRX and your $ will be restored.

TRX,Binance,Issues locating Trx in Binance," 

Hello everyone,

I have ran into an issue locating my Tron coin and figured someone here may be able to help. I recently had a significant amount of Trx in my Binance wallet around May 2018. I reset my phone to factory default settings due to issues with it. However, when I went to request my account info back, I had issues. So I just left it alone for the time being, since I was holding Trx for long term and constantly viewing the price change was consuming my life.

Well I finally decided to log in and it shows I have a 0 balance. I assume that it has to do with the ERC20 migration. However, I always had really small amounts of other coins (ETH and BTC) that I traded to Binance and exchanged for Trx. It shows a zero balance for everything. Now I am wondering where it all went. Is this normal since I was inactive for almost a year?",3,2019-04-08 17:15:53,2

TRX,Binance,Binance froze my money,"Hello all, here is the situation as the largest exchange Binance froze my money. I want to transfer money to my Binance account on November 5, but I can't do it (shows error and asks to contact support), I wrote to support, and after a long wait I was shown the answer, I received 15. 37 NEAR to my account,

And then they asked for information on this payment because they think it was a fraudulent transaction, I said: ""We did the transaction, the person sent me Near and then I sent him TRX (screenshot of how I sent TRX I indicated) and he received everything, then they asked me for transaction details and TXId ( and also our chat with him, I did not have access to it ) a screenshot of correspondence I never made before, during the transaction I asked the person a screenshot of the Near sent to my address , a screenshot of the TRX receipt address . But they still don't have enough of that!!!!. Although transaction was completely fulfilled, after a while the same person with whom I had a transaction sent Near to my purse for the second time . But I couldn't perform this transaction, because my funds are frozen, how can I be cheater, if this person again sent funds to my wallet, it means he trusts me, though I didn't ask to do it.

But the Binance support team thinks this is insufficient proof. This is just ridiculous and sad. They offered me an alternative, I can record a video message where I say I'm willing to return 66.09 NEAR to the original address. And they promised they would remove the blocking (I asked three times!!!) After I recorded the video, the funds were deducted from my account, I contacted support again and was told that my account would be checked for Exchange policy violations and it would take up to 14 days.

My question was created on November 8, 2022, today it is November 30, 2022, 14 days have passed, I am writing to support and they can not answer my question why this happened, one of the support team said to clarify the issue with the team, I am waiting for 5 hours and no answer, it's funny, they first told me the exact date when I at least know the reason for blocking the money, But this period is out, I tried to work with them and did everything they asked, but I did not get an answer, at first they said that if I recorded a video to refund the original sender then ( But this time has long passed, I check my email every day, and no response from them! It's been 22 days, not 14 days as they said, when I ask how long I have to wait, they don't answer me, they say to wait, but they don't call the exact date. I already regret recording this video, and part of the reason they made me do it was because many times they used the request to record the video in their messages. I needed the money urgently and I went along with the action, but did not get the results they promised. It is very frustrating that I am being cheated by the support. Please tell me what to do in this situation? After all, I do not know the reason for the blocking of my funds and how long it will last. I work honestly, and have always been willing to cooperate with them. :\*(",46,2022-11-30 20:30:29,21

I want to send USDT from my Binance exchange Wallet to my Bitmart exchange wallet so that I can trade the USDT for AKT. (Akash Network) USDT is the trading pair for AKT on the Bitmart exchange. 

Does anyone know which ""Transfer Network"" I need to select on the Binance Withdrawal screen?

I have pasted my Bitmart exchange wallet address into the Recipient field on the Binance USDT Withdrawal screen. When I select Tron TRC20 (TRX),  Tether (OMNI) and Binance Chain (BEP 20) I get the error message below:

 The address does not match the currently selected network, it is recommended that you switch to another network.

When I select Ethereum ERC-20 (ETH) I get the warning below: 

 Reminder: For the safety of your funds, please confirm again that the network you wish to use is ETH. 

When I select or Binance Smart Chain (BSC) I get the warning below:

**Have you confirmed that the platform or application you are withdrawing to supports the BSC network?**

Yes, I have confirmed with them directly that they support the BSC network.  
No, I have not confirmed with them directly that they support the BSC network.

I know that if the transfer network is not correct I will lose my crypto. (USDT) I thought it might have been the Tether (OMNI) network.

But man, my main concern is that when I tried to withdraw from Binance into a separate wallet (for trx),  I got a suspicious activity alert which triggered Binance to have to verify me before I can continue with my withdrawals. The problem there is I can't because the United States isn't listed as a supported country from the pull down menu to verify. So now my account is essentially frozen with a couple hundred dollars worth of coins that I can't transfer. What do I do? What can I do?

Then, I did this transaction, exchanging safemoon to eth - and sent to exact same coinbase wallet (copy/paste), but it disappeared and I can't find it anywhere.   It says it went to binance-pegged eth..? 

Only difference is the network in metamask.  Had to use binance smart chain network for the safemoon.
Did I really just get screwed out of all that money?

I said to myself 'oh well' and let the account go dormant. 4 years later, I am now pondering what to do considering as I logged into Binance, I was warned that I am to move my account to BinanceUS if I am in the US.

TRX,BitcoinBeginners,Trading Noob and I Want to Buy In the Dip,"Hey, I've been mining ETH and SC, for the past couple months and I really want to get in on the dip and start trading my coins/Fiat/USD around. Not really day trading, but I want to be more active than just letting it sit there.

I have mined almost a full ETH at nearly .8 of an ETH, and 3,500 SC. I definitely want to get into selling at peaks, and buying in smaller dips more frequently with the coins I do have, to maximize my mining profits.

Also, I have about $500 (min) that I want to use to buy, in this dip.

Going purely based off ATH, and current pricing TRON(TRX), Verge(XVG), MonaCoin (MONA), Ripple (XRP), Siacoin (SC), look like they will have promising returns given they return to 75%-100% of the ATH, and don't take too long on the climb back up.

Going based off what I've heard people talking about, I've also been interested in the top dogs of the market cap, top 30, I mean obviously, so that's just back to your BTC, BCC, ETH, LTC, and etc. As well as coins like IOTA, OmiseGO(OMG), Ripple(XRP), MonaCoin(MONA), Dash, Tron(TRX) and etc.

So my question to the more experienced redditors, is what coins do you trust in coming out of the HODL strong? Should I invest in coins that I know somewhat where they are going based on ATH, or should I look at the smaller altcoins that are still unknown? Short-term vs Long-term holds? Since im only investing a relatively small chunk of money, does that mean I should keep it invested in a few different coins, say 1-3 or should I split it among more coins?

Also, what are the best ways/ exchanges to trade these different coins? My friend used Bitfenix, but since we are in the US and his portfolio, is much larger than mine, that's not really an easy option.

I use the buy low, and sell high trading strategy, but the problem being is I haven't sold any alt coins yet.

TRX,BitcoinBeginners,"Questions on Consensus, Wallets, UTXOs. Somebody please answer. You can give technical explanation also.","Hi Guys, I have read so many articles(except developer.bitcoin website),yet I am not understanding few things.  
1)Let's say , the current block mined is B.There are two pools having major hash power - AntPool and F2pool.Both creates different (but independently correct) blocks at the same time. They keep on doing this every 10 mins. The nodes surrounding them receives their version of blocks which they broadcasted independently. Can this keep happening and the only way to resolve this is if someone loses the race?What if 1.5 hrs passed(9 blocks), and finally the longest chain emerges.Then, will the transactions in the orphan chain be reversed, as 6 blocks is the finality time. How is this situation taken care of?  
2)Do every wallets that exist run full node?  
3)I read that 'full nodes' verifies the block created by mining nodes.By verify, what I understand is they use the nonce,headers,merkle tree root hash, last block hash and some other fields, throw them into a hash function and find whether the resultant hash has met the current difficulty.Am I correct? Do they do anything extra?  
4)When the miners get block rewards?As soon as they create the new block or when that block is proven valid by x number of neighboring full nodes? Also, what happens in case (1) when there is a fork?  
5)What are UTXOs? I can easily understand the Ethereum accounts based system, but not UTXOs.I read some articles but still could not digest it.  
6)How miners update their mempool with new transactions.Let's say there are 2 adjacent miners,each having 1000 transactions in their mempool, out of which 900 are same. One of the miners created a block with those 1000 txs. How will the other miner remove his 900 common trx which has been included?  
7)Bitcoin does not allow fake transactions.What does a fake trx look like? Has it ever happened that some node has broadcasted fake/wrong trx? What does verification of a trx actually mean, in the technical sense?(Sorry for asking too many questions.all these are inter-related.)  
In case my understanding is wrong in any case, please correct it.Also, you can  be technical.Thanks.",5,2024-01-26 11:54:22,11

3) Would a desktop computer wallet have a public and private key?  If so, what does that mean and how would that affect transactions?

I guess my understanding of wallets is just obtuse or limited.

My understanding is that your key is like a ""password"" that won't allow any transactions with the currency unless that key is used.  Is that a simple way to explain and understand the crypto wallet and the key?

TRX,BitcoinBeginners,Ethfinex bot with SURPRISING backtests!,"I built a bot first for Poloniex then for Bitfinex and it's as easy as switching 2 lines of code to get it to work on Ethfinex. Note that the attached backtests are for the bot running Ethfinex pairs on Bitfinex because the backtest suite didn't support Ethfinex out of the box.

In return for being able to run my bot with your balance, I ask that you sign up to Ethfinex using my affiliate link. Non-verified accounts can still deposit and withdraw, however they won't be able to take part in the NEC fee rebate until verified (but earnings are backdated).

If you trade as a maker on Ethfinex, half the maker fees and half the taker fees are refunded to you once a month (on the 14th) in NEC tokens on Ethfinex. This might not sound like a lot but hear me out: when I was running this bot on 0.1 Bitcoin Cash balance on Bitfinex (\~$100) I managed to put $10k USD worth of volume through the order books in 1-2 days (and still turn a profit). If you extrapolate, that could be a ton of fee rebates seeing as how the bot is a maker 3/4 of the time.

The bot should outperform the backtests, as I was unable to find a way to accurately backtest selling/buying half the trade value at a limit and the other half at a trailing stop (which the bot does, to maximize profits).

The bot analyzes the last day's trading activity and sets stop limit reminders for itself to buy/sell at the next down/up Fibonacci levels. It then sells/buys back in at the next Fib level up/down, and 1/2 the value is put into a trailing stop.

I backtested the bot on SAN/BTC, GNT/BTC, TRX/BTC which are all pairs available on Ethfinex (and Bitfinex for backtesting), for a period of \~four months during both an uptrend and downtrend.

\---I had posted this previously for Bitfinex and without relevant backtests, and then found that Bitfinex no longer has an affiliate program. The community also asked for backtests, so I took a day or two to learn how to backtest using Catalyst for Python (while brushing up on my Python skills) to bring you these results---

TRX,CryptoMoon,SunRat: A Rising Power on the Tron Blockchain,"#### Explosive Growth in Just a Few Days

SunRat is quickly making a name for itself as a standout memecoin on the Tron blockchain. Although it’s only a few days old, SunRat has already achieved an impressive market cap of $217,000, positioning it as a formidable contender in the expanding Tron ecosystem. While some memecoins on Tron have reached market caps in the millions, SunRat's rapid growth suggests it has the potential to match—and possibly surpass—those figures soon.

#### Extraordinary Staking Rewards

One of the driving forces behind SunRat’s early success is its innovative approach to community engagement and rewards. Unlike many other memecoins, SunRat launched with a staking mechanism that offers a remarkable 1000% APY (Annual Percentage Yield). This staking feature is designed to attract early adopters and encourage long-term holding, which not only helps to stabilize the token’s value but also fosters organic growth. With staking now live, investors can reap substantial returns by simply holding and staking their SunRat tokens.

#### A Unique Investment Opportunity on Tron

With its rapidly increasing market cap and attractive staking program, SunRat presents a unique opportunity within the Tron ecosystem. Although other memecoins have already reached impressive market valuations, SunRat’s early-stage status provides investors a chance to enter early on a project with strong growth potential. The combination of a rapidly expanding market cap and high-yield staking makes SunRat a compelling choice for investors looking for new opportunities on the Tron blockchain.

#### Supported by a Dedicated Team and Community

SunRat’s appeal goes beyond just its financial incentives. The project is backed by a dedicated development team and a passionate community, both of which are committed to ensuring the token’s long-term success. This strong support system, coupled with innovative staking and early growth potential, makes SunRat an attractive option for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolio with a promising new asset.

#### The Road Ahead for SunRat

As SunRat continues to gain traction, its market cap of $217,000 could see significant growth, narrowing the gap between it and other established memecoins on the Tron network.

TRX,CryptoMoon,What lesson did Jax.Network learn from the Tron problem?,"The solution introduced by Jax.Network

Jax.Network offers a consensus mechanism based on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) system. Instead of centralized staking or voting processes, miners compete against each other to solve cryptographic hash functions to verify transactions on the network and get rewarded. The PoW system requires more energy and time to operate. However, PoW solves a pertinent issue of blockchain centralization, as apparent with Tron PoS and DPoS networks.

In addition, the Jax.Network PoW consensus mechanism provides greater security to the network, disabling malicious collusion among so-called “super representatives.” For a single transaction to be processed, 51% of the mining consensus must implement this change on the blockchain.

TRX,CryptoMoon,"🍀 FRX 🍀 Token Update; Rising Star of DeFi on Tron, Phenomenal Opportunity on Seed Round"," **$FRX (Ferox token)** is a barely 2 months old hidden gem from the currently hyperactive Tron Network with a state of the art crypto team we built around it.

Around 1250 holders now, supply locked at 700 million, very low #MCap steadily increasing, this is as early as you can catch a true #MoonShot candidate before it reaches escape velocity ;).

Seed Round sells at a great discount vs the upcoming IDO which is scheduled to launch right after expansion to Binance Smart Chain, a very high probability play exists here for a minimum 10-15x which is frankly a conservative estimate comparing how well even lesser and totally anonymous IDO candidates have recently fared on BSC...

Just to be clear Tron Network has also invested a lot on launchpads recently, and there is a chance the IDO can occur on Tron too, which would lead to even faster price appreciation as FRX is a native TRC20.

Here is the landing page for the Seed Round, all you need is a Tron wallet that accepts TRC20 tokens to receive $FRX ( like TronLink or Trust Wallet ) 🏆: [**www.frxadvisors.com/frx**](http://www.frxadvisors.com/frx) 🏆

TRX,CryptoMoon,$SUNDOG - The Next Generation Digital Token | Listed on CMC & CG,"In an exciting development for crypto fans, especially the meme coin, the Tron network dives into the integration of Meme culture and increases the ecosystem's popularity and TRX liquidity, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron Network, along with his development team, launched the Sunpump which is a Tron Meme Fair Launch Trading Platform on August 13, 2024. This move led to the creation of SunDog (SUNDOG Token), a meme token on the TRON blockchain, launched on the SunPump platform. Which was created with the vision of becoming the premier meme coin on TRON, leveraging the network's capabilities to foster a strong and engaged community. This led to significant growth and community support for SunDog.

Sundog (SUNDOG) is also recognized as one of the leading community meme coins on the Tron chain, ever since it took the TRON community by storm, making waves right across social media. Gaining traction off podcast appearances by controversial internet figures. Although it was initially created as a lighthearted joke to raise awareness for animal adoption. The coin gained significant popularity after being consistently supported by Justin Sun (TRON's founder).

SunDog has drawn significant attention in the industry due to its impressive innovation, concept, market performance, and stable growth trajectory. Its outstanding community efforts and progress have attracted recognition, and SunPump expressed appreciation for SunDog's role in improving the TRON ecosystem.

You can also check the platform Sunbot which is a valuable trading tool for both novice and experienced traders looking to capitalize on market opportunities. 50% of the trading fees generated by the SunDog trading bot is spent on the buyback and burn of $Sundog.

SunDog's online presence has been rising, attracting a following across multiple social media platforms due to its potential to become a multi-billion dollar market cap coin, and how it established itself as a dominant force in the meme coin space and the broader cryptocurrency market. SunDog has over 120,000 followers on X (previously Twitter), with more than seven tweets each day reaching a total audience of over 200,000 impressions. This active social media engagement can show strong community support in SunDog due to how the token aspires to be more than just a meme coin; it wants to build a thriving ecosystem that offers real utility, community engagement, and long-term value for all holders.

$Sundog is the only meme launching on Tron with the full backing and support of the Tron ecosystem itself.

# 📊 Technical Analysis Recap (Week of Sept 2nd - Sept 8th): Signs of Accumulation and Potential Reversal

Looking back at the past week, $EGO has shown resilience and several key technical patterns that suggest a potential positive movement ahead, despite broader market volatility. Here are the major takeaways from the past week:

* **Support and Resistance in Play:** Throughout the week, $EGO tested key support around **$0.0002574** multiple times, showing the market's firm grip on this price floor. Resistance at **$0.0002975** acted as a ceiling we’ve touched a few times, suggesting that **once breached**, it could set the stage for an **upward rally**.
* **SMA 20/50 Interaction:** Last week, $EGO saw the **20-period SMA** near the **50-period SMA**, a **key bullish signal** when the short-term moving average crosses above the longer-term. Though the crossover didn’t fully complete yet, the proximity of these two indicators signals strength.
* **Bollinger Bands & RSI Trends:** We’re moving towards the lower half of the **Bollinger Bands**, which indicates the market may be **underestimating** the value of **$EGO** at these levels. The RSI fell to the low **30s**, approaching oversold conditions by mid-week, signaling a potential buying opportunity as we head into the new week.
* **Room for Optimism Despite Broader Market Trends:** While many assets struggled last week due to broader ""Rektember"" volatility, $EGO held steady in key areas, signaling that we are well positioned for whenever sentiment shifts. Historically, the market tends to bottom toward the end of September, with significant upside potential heading into Uptober's seasonal bullish trend.

https://preview.redd.it/kji84wf95rnd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=55e2f434cfda4c03d83f849dc65e8fac5d2f6a47

**Bottom Line:** Despite broader market challenges, $EGO is demonstrating **strength** at its key support levels and has positive technical signals indicating a possible turnaround. The RSI shows oversold conditions, and the SMA nearing a bullish crossover suggests we may be poised for a reversal. As we head into mid-September, $EGO is showing promising signs for both short- and long-term growth. Keep an eye on these levels as they could lead to significant upside in the weeks ahead.

**TL;DR:** As we're approaching Uptober $EGO is showing promising signs both technically and in terms of ongoing development. With solid foundations, community-driven goals, and key technical signals pointing toward a potential reversal, it’s an exciting project you definitely want to keep your tabs on! **Whats your take?** And what memecoins will *you* be on the lookout for in the coming days and weeks?

I have been in crypt since the first alt coin cycle, why Kendu is the All Star meme coin of this cycle","Here is my story, I have been in crypto since the first alt coin cycle. Back then I was an idiot and didn’t understand market cap at all. I lost money on Tron, ICN, REQ and some other coins that never went anywhere. Since then I have been in and out of crypto. I joined a telegram group where I learned skills of how to trade, how to analyze charts and what to look for in coins going into a cycle.

This cycle I jumped into some base coins due to their tie to Coinbase, (Aerodrome) that led me to base memecoins. Then I realized they were all pump and dumps. But I knew everyone was looking for the next Doge and Shib. Lots of retail money are looking for those type of gains and want to find a memecoin early to make life changing money.

You have found it with Kendu Inu.

Dev was part of the Shib project.

The main holders are holding to 10 billion plus. Not to mention the holding % has been spread out dramatically over the last 6 weeks during this pullback. Pullback from $250 Million MC to 7 Million MC while going from 9k holders to just under 13k currently. (Super bullish)

Dev has a plan and a goal to run this to 100 billion MC. Yes, that sounds ridiculous. But when you start to dive into look at the tokenomics and how this plan can be reached you find the community.

The community is the difference. This community refuses to fail and shills anywhere and everywhere. They believe and are holding for long term gains. They aren’t looking for a 2x pump then selling. They are expecting 10 billion MC.

So to summarize, a Dev with a long term plan who has been a part of a memecoin that is one of the top 2 of all time. A community that refuses to fail. It has shown that it can rip 5x in a week. Holders going up organically. Zero bots and zero paid marketing to get an influencer pump and dump.

We were just getting started. Through the dump out of last month, holders constantly went upwards. This is the token you want when ETH and BTC break their ATH and run. Kendu will get 10 billion + MC. 100 billion isn’t all that crazy when you look at it.

Read the link at the bottom of the post for a much more in depth view of all that is goin on in Kendu. 

Do your own research, you will ape in.

TRX,CryptoMoon,$BLUE is the #1 dog on Sui chain with an insane upside potential! ,"$BLUE is a memecoin born from a Reddit thread. It's centered around a really cute blue eyed dog. Cute pets are a strong meta in crypto (e.g., $MICHI, $BILLY), and blue represents the $SUI network.

$BLUE is currently at 7M market which means it is the biggest dog coin on Sui chain. And look at the biggest dog coins on ETH, Solana, TON or TRON. They are all at least above 200M and $BLUE will be too.

The reason I said this is that the team working on this coin already launched a Sui coin before and it became the biggest memecoin on Sui sitting at 160M now.

The Sui chain itself is an INSANELY HUGE network worth over $5 billion. And they just started pushing memes a lot with their version of pumpfun.

4M for a coin that just launched on a chain not as known as Solana is something you can not just ignore.

And this is just the beginning. There will be partnerships, CEX listings and on-boarding of influential people in the near future that will push $BLUE to where it belongs. To hundreds of millions.

$BLUE and the whole Sui chain is something you do not want to sleep on. The upside potential here is insane because as soon as influencers start mentioning this chain and normies start getting in. $BLUE and every other early memecoin can do 20x-50x easily.

TRX,CryptoMoon,$HEGE | Why I bet big on this project,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6pleiovmxlbd1.jpg?width=8088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee248ea5aa24d5fef55e2125e14ef829de79729d

Recently, I put down a big pot of money on a handful of projects.

I'll explain why I think this wager makes sense. Moreover, I'll detail why you should do it now, and why Hege should be one of, if not your biggest positions.

## The Meme-coin Supercycle

Central to this gamble is my belief that this cryptocurrency market cycle will be explosive for meme-coins. A market cycle in crypto is often viewed in four-year spurts. In this view, Bitcoin acts as a kind of market bellwether. Every four years, BTC is programmed to undergo a reduction in mining awards known as the ""halving."" This event adds deflationary pressure to BTC. As the price slowly rises, the market takes note and attention returns to cryptocurrency. By year four, a full bull run begins. You can see that this pattern remains more or less consistent for three cycles, with the last one ending in 2021.

The 2020-21 period saw the mania around decentralized fiance and promises of real-world applications, particularly in the ETH ecosystem. Today, it's clear that the market feels let down by the promise of real-world applications. In the previous bull run, investments in tokens that portrayed themselves as serious projects like Cardano saw smaller returns compared to projects that were more fun like Shiba.

Investors know this. The stunning performance of meme tokens lines up with events in the broader markets. You can see it in the performance of Gamestop, Nvidia, or Tesla. The wild compensation packages of executives fit this narrative, as does the soaring costs of housing. Real or perceived, there's a growing sense that value is detached from traditional performance metrics. This creates a market zeitgeist of financial nihilism.

In short, you need to take bigger unconventional risks because that's the only way you'll ever be able to afford a good life. A return of 2-8% on your investments isn't good enough.

In this world, all that matters is narrative, community, and picking the right projects early.

Meme coins understand this worldview. These projects can feel more honest. Gone are the grandiose techno-babble promises. Meme coins understand that they are, at their core, fun, speculative vehicles. They won't change the world but might change your world.

These assets are now a proven vehicle for profit. Had you invested $100 USD into Shibu in its third month, you would be a multimillionaire today. You'd be a multimillionaire even after you slept through the 2022-2023 bear market where Shibu lost 90% of its value. Many meme tokens have since followed in its footsteps.

With the BTC halving behind us, we are in year three of the cycle. If historical trends hold up, the BTC price will start moving decisively upwards in the fall. Shib, for example, emerged in year three of the BTC cycle and became a market legend in the following bull run.

I believe now is the time to pick these winning projects for the next bull run.

## Why Solana-based projects?

History often rhymes; even if it doesn't repeat. Now it's the Solana ecosystem's turn to emerge as a strong market force in 2025. Arguably, that's already happened.

It's arguably the top chain by transaction count. Even today, look at the added friction in buying something like Kendu versus Hege. Most got into Kendu via MetaMask in its early days, but Metamask requires workarounds to buy Solana projects. This is not the case for the most popular Solana wallet, Phantom. Likewise, buying SOL is cheaper than ETH, and transferring SOL off an exchange to your hot wallet is faster.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8pxfpiatxlbd1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fa4f48c0b026de80f97992b43a26b5c8317049c

This isn't to say ETH projects won't be successful, only that the Solana ecosystem is easier to access and better suited for meme-coin experimentation. As a Solana token, Hege will benefit from this newer network and alignment of historical trends.

## Why Hege?

Central to Hege is the character Hege himself. He's a plucky, simple guy trying to make his way in a world where the odds are stacked against him. With each market cap milestone, another chapter in his story is unlocked. Hege's simple art style makes it easy for even novice artists to create memes.

The Hege developers understand that building a strong brand of memes and organic community building are the keys to success. To be truly successful in this space, they need to harness their community.

Harness their community they most certainly do! Contests are ongoing for the best meme artwork, the most active commentator, the best Reddit postings, and the best TikTok video. Contests can offer hundreds of dollars worth of Hege for the bigger prizes. There are frequently second and third-place prizes. Recently, there was a riddle contest to uncover the seed phrase for a wallet worth $1000 USD!

As a result, Hege's promotional content is everywhere on Reddit and increasingly showing a presence on Twitter. Rewards are given from the marketing fund, which is operated by the community itself and anyone who contributes has a say in the winner. The CEX fund alone had 140K in community donations in two weeks.

At times, the community is so strong that Hege feels like the early stages of a movement. This is a great sign for the project. Tesla showed signs of a cult of believers, and look at how well its stock performed. People who feel a sense of belonging and believe in a narrative of future potential invest big and are far less willing to walk away.

The results are undeniable. For example, Hege was added to six CEXs in two weeks, two of them today.

## Key Metrics

* Project age: 3 months
* Supply: 1B
* CEXs: Azbit, Toobit, Indoex, Superex BitMart, MEXC
* Market cap: 20M
* Holders: 7,300
* ATH: 30M
* Telegram members: 5,750
* Twitter followers: 10375

## Is Hege a pump and dump?

I don't believe Hege has any likelihood of becoming a pump-and-dump scheme. Here are the reasons:

**Good token fundamentals.** Freeze and mint authority revoked. LP tokens burned. No honeypot and no tax. Locked liquidity pool of 1.1M.

**Good distribution.** The top holder owns only 4% of the supply.

**A culture of long-term holders.** The top holder has not sold any of their bags in months. A similar pattern of diamond hands can be found in the other top ten holders. You can see the last time more than 10,000,000 Hege tokens occurred was 21 days ago.

**Robust recovery.** In the previous sale, now worth over $246,000 USD, the resulting dip was quickly scooped up by new buyers. Simply put, it is unlikely that any single seller can cause an unrecoverable price crash.

**Sizable CEX wallet.** The community and developers have contributed generously. It currently stands at 30K USD and was as high as 140K USD. It's unlikely such a large wallet would be maintained if the developers intended to cut and run.

**Active and sensible socials.** Based on the age of the project, the number of likes on a typical Twitter post is about what you'd expect from a growing project. Not zero, but not some ridiculous bot-manipulated number either.

Reddit posts tend to hover between 10-100 likes per posting. This is about what you should expect from a community that pushes its most active Telegram members to participate in Reddit promotional postings.

Of course, a meme-coin lives and dies by the strength of its community. Hege is strong on this front, with a very active Telegram. Not only is the community active, but I have personally seen the developers post frequently and interact with the community. Regular voice meetings are held too. In these meetings, the developers appear articulate, hard-working, and intelligent. The recorded meetings are available on Hege's Twitter.

Last but not least, may I present what is perhaps the best verification of them all:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ezrs8fuxlbd1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=896632e0d819e8cfb1b2566221485572e6402d83

The lead developer's sister allegedly made this. Who creates culinary confections for a scam?

## How much can I make?

Let's take a look at a $100, $1000 and $10000 USD investment if made today at roughly \~20M market cap. We'll look at near-term returns like 50 million, all the way up to returns should Hege go parabolic in a future bull run.

|20M|50M|100M|500M|1B|5B|10B|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|100|250|500|2500|5000|25,000|50,000|
|1000|2500|5000|25,000|50,000|250,000|500,000|
|10000|25000|50,000|250,000|500,000|2,500,000|5,000,000|

Could Hege reach a 1 billion market cap? 10 billion? I believe the answer is yes and possibly yes. Many meme coins like Dogwifhat and Pepe have soared past a 1B market cap and continue to grow. These projects have all achieved these valuations before any proper bull run. At its peak, Shib reached nearly 60 and Doge 90 billion! Hege may never reach 90 billion, but what you might not know is that Hege is actually growing much faster than Shiba did in its early months.

Take a look at the Kendu chart as measured from its creation to three months:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n6jx7qeqxlbd1.jpg?width=1962&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=336a0961c7b1b724b412ca7cf3f2518c4819df0a

Now look at Hege's chart:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jdozl94rxlbd1.png?width=1948&format=png&auto=webp&s=b31faac2d6041adde3c238387733ea8d3b1fe0b4

Both projects have strong, active communities and similar charts. Kendu jumped up to 100M+ after three months. It was a well-deserved jump as they worked hard for it, just like Hege is doing now.

I believe that the best play is to take a large position and do it fast. Hege is perfectly positioned as a young project with huge growth potential, but not so young that its long-term viability is untested. Hege's growth is also clearly present and moving fast. You may want to get in before the traditionally strong fall season and hold through till the next bull run. Big bets on Hege are already coming in, with a record $37,000 USD two days ago. That individual has since bought more. Even if the markets don't follow past historical trends, a bull run always happens. It's not a matter of if, but when. Of course, all the usual warnings apply. I am not a financial expert. Do your own research.

My conviction is simple: Meme coins offer undeniable opportunity. Hege will be profitable. It could be very, very profitable. It could be the life-changing play you are looking for.

&#x200B;

Note: I can provide Solscan wallet links for addresses described above, but unfortunately SubReddits tend to ban external links or even wallet addresses so feel free to message me in Hege's Telegram if you need verification.",11,2024-07-10 03:05:19,8

TRX,CryptoMoon,"SUNRAT: A standout among other tokens in the space, and its ability to be easily transferred and stored on mobile devices has made it accessible to a wider audience.","**SunRat** is a meme token on the Tron blockchain that is gaining attention for its unique approach and potential for massive growth. The token is positioned as a community-driven project, with a clear strategy to differentiate itself from other meme tokens. One of the key elements is its integration with the SunPump platform, a new initiative on the Tron network designed to support and promote promising projects.

SunRat is also building a strong and dedicated community known as the “Exclusive Rat Club.” This group consists of early adopters and supporters who are committed to the project’s long-term success. The team behind SunRat is fully engaged, ensuring that the project remains transparent and trustworthy—a crucial factor in a market often plagued by short-lived tokens and rug pulls.

The token was just launch a couple of days ago, and it’s already making a mark with a market cap of $400K+. Early adopters are buzzing about its potential, especially as the token gains traction on popular platforms like Twitter and Reddit.

SunRat's ambitious plans for the future include the introduction of staking, which will allow token holders to earn rewards by holding onto their SunRat tokens. This feature is expected to attract even more interest from the crypto community, as it offers an additional incentive for those who believe in the long-term potential of the project.

The staking feature is not just about rewards; it represents a deeper commitment to the project's sustainability and growth. By encouraging token holders to stake their coins, SunRat aims to create a more stable and engaged community, which in turn can lead to increased market confidence and a stronger token value over time.

**SunRat** is a unique project on the Tron blockchain with a strong community, a dedicated team, and strategic growth plans. It's worth keeping an eye on to see how it develops in the future.

TRX,CryptoMoon,"GT Protocol, The Most Hyped AI Project in 2024. $GTAI IDO and SHO Are Open Now","https://preview.redd.it/0zzif4ab44dc1.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=60e89b31b0462a0176f630c5bb1370bbd0a4f0ac

### Unraveling a Robust Ecosystem

As a crypto enthusiast navigating the vast landscape of blockchain projects, one gem that has caught my attention is GT Protocol (GTAI). This decentralized Web3 funds management platform, paired with Blockchain AI Execution Technology, has constructed a robust ecosystem that seamlessly integrates into the crypto space. The amalgamation of the GT APP, Investment Protocol, AI Execution Technology, and API SDK creates a comprehensive suite of tools that caters to both novice and experienced users.

### Unique Approach to Success

What sets GT Protocol apart is its customer-centric approach. Unlike many platforms, GT Protocol doesn't burden users with monthly or annual subscription fees. Instead, it charges fees solely on the profits users make from the GT Web3 Investment Marketplace. This unique focus on user success speaks volumes about their commitment to creating a mutually beneficial environment for investors.

### Retail and Enterprise Inclusivity

In a market where projects often prioritize one over the other, GT Protocol stands out by catering to both retail and enterprise clients. This dual focus allows for broader accessibility, making their AI Execution Technology and Web3 Investment Marketplace available for integration into third-party Web2 and Web3 platforms.

### Embracing Market Diversity

One striking feature is GT Protocol's commitment to supporting various markets simultaneously. While other platforms might lean towards DeFi, CeFi, or NFT exclusively, GT Protocol integrates them all. This inclusivity ensures that users have a diverse array of investment opportunities across different crypto sectors.

### Proven Traction and Growth

What truly instills confidence in exploring GT Protocol further is its track record. With a live product boasting 70,000 registered users, $900K+ in revenue, and key partnerships with Binance and TRON, GT Protocol has already established itself as a significant player in the crypto space.

### A Promising Roadmap

Looking ahead to the GT Protocol roadmap for 2024 and beyond, there's a clear commitment to continuous development and improvement. With planned releases such as AI Investment Assistant, Web3 Funds upgrades, and advanced AI features, GT Protocol seems poised for sustained growth and innovation.

In conclusion, GT Protocol stands as a project worth checking in 2024, not just for its impressive features and partnerships but also for its user-friendly approach, commitment to success, and a roadmap that hints at a promising future in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.

TRX,CryptoMoon,"Want to have some fun in a bear market? Degen play that is not a token, but an Automated Market Maker (AMMdefi) doing arbitrage trades for u. Read more and see how u can make a passive income.","Want to have some fun in a bear market?

I have been tracking this project I found out about via another group I am in for a long time. Solid group. Couple of devs in it etc. A few months ago someone posted there about this automated market maker (AMMdefi) that u can sign up for and that does **automated arbitrage trades** across several CEX. It’s called **AMMddfi.**

U make an account with only your email. Send USDT over the **Tron** network to your deposit adres. U can then make a trade when u click start. The AMM takes about 2/3 minutes to do a trade. I will takes 50% of the profit and 50% is credited to your account. U can then use that money for another trade if u want etc. **So compounding**.

So after a few months of monitoring I decided to give it a go. I send 300 usd and found out a bit more about how it works along the way. It has been 23 days and I am now sitting at 617 dollar. That includes a few small bonuses I got. For example 2 usd for joining the official TG room.

Anyway, u make an account with your e-mail adres. U go to assets and depots usdt via Tron network. Only Tron network is accepted. U will get 3 usd for free for making an account. U will then have **vip** **level 1.** With level 1 u can hit the trade button 2 times per day. **It gives \~1% profit per trade.** Sometimes a little bit more. I had a few trades with close to 1.5% in profit. Least I got was 0.9%.

For **vip level 2** u need 2 friends to join via your referral and deposit at least 60 usdt. Then u bump from 2 to 5 trades per day. It bumped my trading profit to **3.5% per day** on average.

The more people use your referral the more u can make per day. Because u will receive 15% of the trade of your referral and again 7.5% of the referrals his referral. They don’t get less, but u do get that extra percentage.

They have 5 vip levels. It’s not unlimited.

In your account u can see the trades it made for u. So far they al worked out for me. And many have been able to withdraw for a long time now. Longest I know is doing it for 6 months now.

&#x200B;

for a few days more they have some bonuses running for new people:

\*Deposit 100 and get 8 usd

\*Deposit 500 and get 38 usd

\*Deposit 1000 and get 68 usd

For depositing 300 for the first time u also get 1 “Lucky spin” and 500 gives u 2 spins. Sort of wheel of fortune for some extra bonus.

&#x200B;

So yeah this has been going on for many months now. **At least 6 months that I know of.** And withdrawals have been working ever since.

For example:

If u put in 100 dollars. After 3 months with vip level 1 (the lowest level) u get 1% per trade, 2 times a day makes: 100 x 1.01\^240 = 1089 dollar

Or with 500 dollars and 3 months level 1 / 2 trades per day: 500 x 1.01\^240 = 5446 dollar.

\*3 months = 120 x 2 trades per day= 240 1% trades. This can escalate quickly as u can imagine.

See it as a real degen play. Don’t put massive amount in. But so far it seems like fun. I am playing with only 300 usd I sold for a random meme coin that went to hibernation. I will be taking out initial once I double the money and the rest is free money.

XRP Apes is changing the game with 7% automatic XRP rewards.

Why is our coin so big? 3 letters, 1 coin. ❗️❗️X R P❗️❗️ We all know where XRP will be in a few years. XRP is easily a top 3 coin if it weren’t for the US judicial system. Once Ripple wins, there is no where to go but up. ⬆️

TRX,CryptoMoon,"German Shepherd ICO launch on 11/30 at 05:00 AM Zulu. Better, faster, stronger than Shiba Inu. On 2 networks."," 

https://preview.redd.it/hrtmdi6g5lz71.png?width=430&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed6a01269cf41fb33965fc9605cafea15c2f3fa0

German Shepherd live ICO launch on 11/30/2011 at: [www.germanshepherd.live](http://www.germanshepherd.live/)

German   Shepherd cryptocurrency is faster and transaction fees are  times-fold   less expensive than Doge or Shiba tokens. It also acts as a  safe  haven  with it's limited 3,000,000 total supply on Binance Smart  Chain.

The   project aims to create two-way option for holders, but on more  fee-friendly (BSC and Tron) networks that are faster. GSHE act as a    store-of-value as GSH is catching up. These pros offer a competitive    edge against ERC20 networks, while making transfers to your peers.

The   contracts will be shared on the site at the date of the launch  where   one will be able to exchange to tokens below, both with Metamask,   Trust  Wallet, TronLink and other wallets.

Project   stands on grounds of fair-and-square contracts, with them  being  public  and absolutely no distributions, premines from creators.   Initial  liquidity is to be burned/locked and liquidity providers have   an  opportunity in earning.

After ICO, project will seek to be listed on selected exchanges and expand its scope of reach.

German Shepherd tokens are sleak, with an artist creating the logo of the design. Here are numbers for the tokens:

GSHE(Binance   Smart Chain Network) Total supply: 3,000,000 ICO:  1,000,000 Marketers   and liquidity providers' reward: 500,000 Rest:  Public and unlocked  after  ICO.

GSH(Tron Network)  Total  supply: 10,000,000,000 ICO: 3,000,000,000  Marketers and  liquidity  providers' reward: 1,000,000,000 Rest: Public  and unlocked  after ICO.

Below is an official Telegram page for the cryptocurrency. Stay tuned for instructions of how to get it on 11/30/2021.

TRX,CryptoMoon,BillionaireCoin💲 Successfully closed the PreSale 👍Professionally Audited ✅ Roadmap on time ✔️ | 📈2000+ Holders in less the 1 hour | 💥Huge 1000x potential💥 Now live on PancakeSwap🥞,"💲BILL is here!

🚀 BILLIONAIRE COIN has aggressively entered the Crypto Market with a SUCCESFULL Presale!

They easily surpassed their soft cap of 500 BNB by 3 times and had a huge participation with more than 2000 invertors!💥

The hard cap per person was kept really low (1 BNB) in order to avoid the presence of whales 🐳 and this has build up a strong community.

🥞They have listed on PancakeSwap on Saturday 29th May on 18.17 UTC and have now 2200 holders.

The community is on fire 🔥, the team is working hard to keep the promises made and the project has a huge potential!

But let’s now dig a bit into this project, shall we ⁉️

🔹 BILLIONAIRE COIN is launching its own cross-chain Launchpad and aims to guarantee maximum transparency and fairness to its users. These two values have been the hallmark of cryptocurrency and blockchain development. But so far are we really getting it in full as anticipated?! Especially with the emerge of cross-chain Launchpad platforms? We may assume it as humans but let’s be real, at least for once! The crypto world has to keep up with the latest security updates as hackers and scammers are always working on new ways to defraud clients. The challenge is even bigger on cross-chain platforms as they strive to develop new ways to counter hackers and scammers who are always lurking across the chains.

🔹 Luckily, BILLIONAIRE COIN is here to solve these problems! Its Team have been in this industry for more than 5 years and they have gone through several public sales. This has given them the opportunity to learn from other’s mistakes and have built in them the right knowledge to be able to build a better, advanced and fair Cross-Chain Launchpad. The new avant-garde whitelisting system will hold several IDOs and will give unique rewards to $BILL holders. The developers have committed to design a top-notch and scalable cross-chain Launchpad while its token continues to expand into the market by listing on new exchanges and growing his community with a regular Marketing Campaigns.

🔹 The new innovative whitelisting system, will be implemented from the beginning and will give a fair chance to everyone to get in the private and public sales. Nowadays, several crypto investors conduct their businesses via cross-chain platforms and BILLIONAIRE COIN will provide them a safe cross-chain Launchpad, thus will facilitate the launch of new projects on the major blockchains such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Tron, etc. BILLIONAIRE COIN is unique in that, unlike other competitors, BILL’s holders will have a 5% passive reward (shared between all BILL holders) through all transactions made on PancakeSwap.

🔹 BILLIONAIRE COIN will be a transparent platform for its community, which is quite hard to find on its competitors. An example is the fact that it will have and open IDO Live Whitelisting system that gives every user a more convenient and transparent experience than they could not get anywhere else. But let’s not ruin all the surprises and let’s the team share the other amazing futures they will incorporate!

🔹 While cross-chain Launchpad platforms do not put much emphasis on the fairness principle as more established or bigger investors dominate the activities of on the platforms, BILLIONAIRCOIN has taken a different approach. It has adopted whitelisting rules that will permit both smaller and bigger investors to participate in their IDOs. The rules will be comprised of controlled parameters in order to maximize everyone’s chance to be part of it, which is in line with its fairness principle. BILLIONAIRE COIN it’s building up a strong community to support its cross-chain Launchpad project. With its current developments, the team is determined to make cross-chain transactions as smooth as possible for users. It’s clear they want us to continue spreading their gospel even as we keep our ears to the ground on new developments.

Quit Wasting Your Money Away""","The greater part of the venture that individuals make is in the scope of two or three $100 in a month and on stages that don't uphold more than 2–3 blockchains. They wind up getting fewer returns. We have an answer Invest with SmashCash that is the first on the planet to work with MoonRiver, Harmony ONE, Fantom and Arbitrum blockchains separated from supporting xDai, Solana, Avax, Matic, USDT, BNB; and we are not halting, we are adding more. Contribute with us and quit squandering your cash in different stages.

In the most recent few months, SmashCash has been tremendously widening its essence on new blockchains. SmashCash has been growing its essence by choosing new blockchains. The convention previously got conveyed on Ether, Binance chain, MATIC, AVAX, Moonriver, Fantom, Harmony one, Solana, xDai and Arbitrum.

We are tremendously eager to illuminate you that our excursion isn't finished at this point. SmashCash is on the rock'n'roll to the following stop

**USDT on Binance Blockchain.**

As we compose this article, SmashCash savvy contracts are prepared to join USDT. Tie is a fiat-collateralized stable coin that offers people the benefits of executing with blockchain-based resources while relieving value hazard

Go along with us to invite the BNB token as a pool on SmashCash.

Established in 2014, Tether was one of the soonest steady coins made, based upon Mastercoin (Omni), which was a convention layer for Bitcoin that acquainted the steady coin idea with the world in 2012. Tie spearheaded what is presently known as a fiat-collateralized stable coin model, and is currently the most broadly utilized stable coin today.

Tie was made as an endeavor to address two significant issues with existing cryptographic forms of money: high instability and convertibility between fiat monetary standards and digital currencies. To resolve these apparent issues Tether made cryptographic money that is completely supported 1:1 by stores of U.S. dollars held at banks. On Ethereum, USDT tokens are addressed as ERC-20 tokens, while on Bitcoin, Tether uses the Omni layer, to address USDT tokens. While the actual tokens work in a decentralized organization, Hong Kong-based Tether Ltd is exclusively liable for making and recovering tokens just as keeping up with the 1:1 store backing.

Trades have been the essential clients of USDT as an option in contrast to fiat monetary standards, lessening or disposing of the need to keep up with outside financial connections.

In March 2019, Tether refreshed its exposure explanation guaranteeing that its tokens are as of now not supported 100% by U.S. dollar stores. Tie is rather now upheld 100% sponsored by holds, which incorporate customary money and money reciprocals and, now and again, different resources and receivables from advances made by Tether to outsiders, which might incorporate subsidiary substances.

We might want to give you a concise bit about the USDT.

**Why USDT?**

Tie depends on a proof-of-holds framework to guarantee that save resources match coursing tokens. This requires an outsider to review Tether's ledgers consistently to show that U.S. dollar holds are held in a sum equivalent to extraordinary tokens. Tie utilizes an IOU issuance model where each USDT addresses a case for $1.00 held in the Tether's stores which clients can reclaim whenever.

On Bitcoin, USDT tokens are given by means of the Omni Layer convention, which is a convention worked as a layer over Bitcoin that takes into consideration the issuance of tokens addressing any sort of resource.

On Ethereum, USDT tokens are given utilizing the ERC-20 convention standard for making tokens on Ethereum. ERC-20 tokens incorporate a typical arrangement of decisions that characterize how a token can be moved, supported, and mentioned.

**USDT Metrics 📈**

· USDT has a detailed market capitalization of $71.36 Billion.

· As of September 2020, there are over 14.4 billion USDT tokens available for use, which are moved by $14.6 billion in resources, as per Tether.

· USDT doesn't have its own blockchain, all things being equal, it works as a second-layer token on top of other digital currencies' blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, Bitcoin Cash and OMG, and is gotten by their separate hashing calculations.

TRX,CryptoMoon,SREAL - SRS | NFT application in Stock Digitalization of Real Assets | $0M Market cap,"✅  What is SREAL?

SReal was founded on the idea that it is possible to tokenize assets through cryptography and by using this particular type of technology and business model it will become a bridge between the property owner and the investor. investment. The main idea is to disrupt the financial sector and become the new era of investment. Currently, people have few options to deploy their capital, they must rely on debt or equity instruments, which are high risk and can be very volatile, or store their money. in a savings account with an interest rate close to 0%. Therefore, it is necessary to provide accessibility so that people can invest in assets such as real estate, art or rare resources that increase in value over time; they are profitable instruments and due to their intrinsic character are less volatile than debt and equity instruments.

✅  SReal Business Models

1. Tokenization Assets Exchange

Through our platform, you can invest in a wide range of different asset classes with different risk and reward profiles that meet your investment needs. You can invest in real estate such as residential, industrial or commercial real estate; invest in famous paintings by famous artists; or even invest in infrastructure projects like renewable energy assets. New markets around the world are opening up before your eyes.

2. SReal Global Digital Markets

We execute, tag, short sell and report and can customize our loan products to suit each client's specific business strategy. Our financial platform supports loans in US dollars, stablecoins and larger cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and others depending on demand and availability on our platform.

·      Counterparty will then post collateral, once received, SReal will send requested coins or fiat
·      Interest payments will be made monthly
·      Daily statements and reporting available through our online portal

✅ What is SRS?

SRS is the utility token at the heart of the SREAL Platform. Token holders will experience benefits across the entire platform and are expected to obtain benefits from future projects, products, and services, etc. 

1. Payments

Tokens can be spent on the platform, providing immediate benefit to active users through discounted or free access to premium features.

2. Staking Benefits

Staking provides users with benefits for holding tokens, such as discounted fees, and bonus rewards. This brings tokens temporarily out of circulation, creating an artificial decrease in supply.

TRX,CryptoMoon,"Stick To Projects That Let You Earn Passive Income While You Hold Your Bag! With $BET, You Earn Steady Staking Dividends In Bitcoin & Ethereum On The First Decentralised Play-To-Earn Casino. Over $10M In Dividends Paid Since 2018.","PS: Do Your Own Research. This is not financial advice.

&#x200B;




Bitcoin & Ethereum are The Top 2 Cryptocurrencies in the Space Right Now.

However, how would it feel to earn sweet daily dividends by farming a lowly token based in the Decentralised Crypto Casino Industry. 

ENTER $[BET token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/earnbet/) !

$BET is the native token for [EarnBet](https://luck.earnbet.io), and the BET Gaming Network. At the moment, this includes the EarnBet and EOSBet platforms. 

Built on the WAX Blockchain, Earnbet is the first Crypto Casino to go fully decentralised, offering players provably fair and verifiable games as well as full custody of their private keys. The Casino is also partnered with Chainlink for Oracle Integration.

Now here's the correlation with Bitcoin & Ethereum. BET Token holders can stake their BET bags and earn dividends as EarnBet shares its entire profits made on all Player-wagers in BITCOIN and ETHEREUM to these stakeholders. In addition to rewarding holders with these profits, the BET token also benefits from a ""buyback-and-burn"" with all profits from all wagered altcoins volume. 

In other words, I earn dividends in Bitcoin and Ethereum monthly while watching deflationary measures bump up the value of my $BET hold. 

Over $10M in dividends have been given out to stakeholders since inception in 2018.

The beauty remains that you watch your bag pump while enjoying monthly dividends in the top two cryptos.

It will interest you to note that $BET tokens has over 80% of its circulating supply already staked for dividends with a significant value staked long term.


* Total Supply: 88,000,000
* Staked: 61,452,921
* Burned: 1,499,898
* Unstaked: 13,231,813
* Uncirculating: 11,815,368

The relatively low supply of unstaked tokens (that is, tokens that can potentially be sold on exchanges) should interest you further.

Numerous Staking plans exist with the lowest at 1 day and the longest at 5 Years. If you're a hodler though, I wouldn't see the need to touch anything below 90 days (My Opinion).


$BET can be purchased on BinanceDEX, Uniswap, HotBit & also via the DEX function in the Trust Wallet App via swap with BNB.


Players also earn $BET tokens for each wager placed on the Casino tables.

PS: 
Every week, Earnbet rewards the Top 10 Players for the week in bags of cryptos plus a share of 10,000 $BET Tokens.

This Week (Like Every Other Week), there's A 3,000 USDT + 10,000 $BET Tokens Giveaway going down at [Earnbet](https://luck.earnbet.io) right now.
To enter, play any of the classic games on offer to earn Leaderboard points.

Top 10 Players on the Leaderboard share the entire bounty. 

Top Player carts away 1,050 USDT + 3,000 BET. 

Closes Every Tuesday by 12:00 UTC.




Play To Also Earn a Guaranteed $50 BTC Signup Bonus on first deposits above $100.


Earnbet accepts deposits in 14 major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, EOS, XRP, BNB, BCH, LINK, LTC & USDT.
