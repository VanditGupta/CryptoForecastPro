ADA,cryptocurrency,Are you optimistic about Cardano?,"Cardano is currently in Epoch 500 which means 2500 consecutive days of no downtime. Quite the achievement. In a way, cardano has proven to withstand the test of time as it is still in the top 10 of cryptocurrencies ranked by marketcap. (As of now... It changes regularly on coinmarketcap)

  
It is currently preparing the launch of the Chang Hardfork in the coming days. An exciting update, which enables full community governance. The devs show no signs of slowing down, there are new projects launching regularly and soon you can even play Doom on cardano.   
But the lack of liquidity and volume is still a problem, even tho it has been growing during the bearmarket.

So I am wondering what you think about it and what you are going to do. Do you just hodl and wait to break even or are you still accumulating? A lot of people seem to have turned against ADA in this sub...

ADA,cryptocurrency,Misinformation around Cardano,"It’s really irritating how much misinformation and blatant lying is occurring around Cardano at the moment. My support for the project has never been shy, I believe it’s a great project that has legs to run on the cycle. But the misinformation and lying that Charles is working for the administration is completely untrue.

In his video found on YouTube, he said in 2025 he will approach the industry differently that he has so far. He’ll spend the year lobbying for crypto regulation (as he’s been doing for years now), amongst other industry leaders in the crypto space (headed by an ex Ripple CEO). Anyone can speak to this commmittee. He isn’t enacting policy, and he doesn’t have any say in anything that’s presented. He’s able to speak to the committee that is then lobbying.

This was disclosed after him, taking time off from social media post stepping away from the project since the release of chang hard fork and genesis keys were burned The blantant lying that he is directly working with the administration and an official advisor to the president is completely untrue.

I feel it’s important for people to know since the truth is being stretched so far in our direction that is completely unsubstantiated.

ADA,cryptocurrency,It’s been over 11 weeks and there are still no Cardano dapps,"Since my first post that was almost 11 weeks ago raising concerns about the “upcoming” dapps on Cardano, there have been no news on this.

I was not only personally insulted in PMs, called a FUDer and an liar by the vast majority of Cardano holders, but was also told that Cardano dapps would be running 1 week after Alonzo Fork and dexes like Sudaeswap and ERGO would be fully functional any “moment” after the Alonzo Fork.

So, are there any news about that?? Did the concurrency problem get resolved? If yes, why are there no functioning dexes on Cardano yet? Can someone from the Cardano community enlighten us please?",5972,2021-11-24 14:53:39,3015
ADA,cryptocurrency,"Cardano network clogged, Avalanche congested a while ago, Polygon almost stopped completely due to some flower picking game. Are these really going to work as an alternative to Ethereum with its high gas fees?"," Before anyone goes nuclear I will say that ETH is too damn expensive. But are the alternatives really so much better? 

Recent news about Cardano congestion shooting up around 90% and more, Polygon being borderline unresponsive during Sunflower popularity/incident, and AVAX fees getting sky high while network suffered congestion a few months ago.

If these networks had the Ethereum levels of activitynon them, they wouldnt hold for long. Cardano has a handful of dapps and its already clogged? Same with Polygon. 1 dapp putting whole network on stop is really not what people would expect of the so called ""next gen eth competitors.""

While I 100% agree that gas fees on Ethereum are absurd, I wonder if the alternatives that we have at the moment in top10 are going to solve that. All claim insane TPS and finality times, but when the shit gets real, the fees and network congestion go up to the sky.",4618,2022-01-27 16:14:15,2952
ADA,cryptocurrency,"For those of you who weren't here during the bear market, Cardano dumped from above $1 to $0.03 and no one talked about it because they had delivered nothing but empty promises for 3 years despite intense marketing and hundreds of millions of dollars in funding. Do you really think anything changed?","The main focus throughout the bear market was the development of the Ethereum ecosystem. That is why the most popular dApps are all currently comfortably situated on the Ethereum main network. Yes, Ethereum's price dumped during the bear market as well, but the OGs in the space and all of the developers kept their eyes laser focused on the development happening within the Ethereum ecosystem.

I personally believe there are several solid alternatives to Ethereum (Polygon, Avalanche, Solana), but unless such networks have built a bridge to Ethereum, they likely will not survive. That is why all of the chains I mentioned were forced to develop bridges to Ethereum because no developer in their right mind would leave the Ethereum ecosystem for a risky sidechain or other layer 1 network. I do not think Cardano will be any different, but this is just my opinion.

Unless someone can tell me otherwise, I am not aware of any actively used dApp that has committed to migrating from other chains to Cardano. Unless you see the likes of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, Synthetix, USDC, and Yearn talk about migrating to Cardano, there really isn't anything to talk about with regard to ""Cardano killing Ethereum"". Hint: they'll never migrate.

I'm posting this because I'm getting sick of the manic Cardano threads where bagholders are desperately trying to get others to buy so the price goes higher and they can sell. Yes, they are scheduled to release smart contracts soon, but the biggest question remains, ***who is going to use their platform***? I have seen extraordinarily innovative developments being made on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and those did not happen overnight and it's hard to imagine people just packing up their bags and leaving to work on Cardano.

To all of the people about to yell at me for making another ""Cardano is overhyped post"" I want you to take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror: have you ever actually *used* Ethereum? Polygon? Avalanche? Solana? Have you ever actually *used* a decentralized exchange, lending protocol, NFT marketplace/game, or provided liquidity to these networks? I have. I've done all of it. So do you really have the perspective to be arguing about ""Ethereum killers"" and how ""great"" Cardano will be when you don't even have experience with engaging and interacting with smart contracts?

Where is all of your hype really coming from, the echo chambers on Twitter and Reddit? I'm asking because I fell for the same ""academic scientific approach"" marketing in 2017 and it's just the same cycle over and over again - Cardano is great at making money during bull markets, but not very good at delivering promised products, but I really hope I'm wrong this time.

!remindme 8 months

EDIT: Maybe some users in the comment section can look at one another and realize that there is not a single rebuttal to my points (removed technical because one user is right, I didn't really provide ""technical"" arguments). Every post is about price action. Will Cardano potentially make you some money this bull run? Sure, that is, if you aren't stuck holding bags while everyone sells the top. But please, let's stay on topic. Present some counterarguments related to the actual utility of the network.

EDIT 2: People should be aware that there was very similar hype surrounding Cardano leading up to the Coinbase [listing date](https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-launching-on-coinbase-pro-694b1cb8c778?gi=2495f7011d1c) (March 16-18), and the hype pump peaked at 1.38 (ATH at the time) on March 17, dumped to 1.24 (-10%) by March 18, and continued to dump to 1.06 (-25%) by March 24. Sure, it kept going up, and we may see a similar ""pump, dump, pump"" related to the smart contract release, but the ""pump"" following the ""dump"" all depends on execution and whether people actually care to use Cardano's platform.

EDIT 3: Thanks to a great comment by u/BornToBeHwild, I learned that Cardano is already developing and supporting an Ethereum bridge ([https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/)), which proves my point entirely - Cardano won't ""kill everything in this space"", they are already building measures to integrate with the existing ecosystem and adapt, so maybe it's time to stop saying it will end all of the progress that has already been made in decentralized finance and media and take over the world.

EDIT 4: I realize that my post is very triggering and I will edit the language a bit to emphasize the points I'm trying to make and remove some of the more triggering elements. Sometimes you forget in all of the mania that people have money at stake and I by no means am trying to ""FUD"" Cardano. I have friends and family who own this coin and I actually like Charles as he introduced me to a lot of the concepts I learned about in this space through his videos and lectures. I hope Cardano succeeds.

The point of my post was that people need to understand there already a ton of great, functioning products out there that all promised similar ""Ethereum killing"" capabilities that ultimately had to adapt and integrate with Ethereum in order to remain relevant and I do not think Cardano will be any different (see EDIT 3). Just trying to set expectations, especially for newcomers who are probably feeling FOMO for Cardano and are tempted to buy it while it's up x2 it's 2017 ATH and at the peak of its bull run. I'm not saying it won't go higher, but I do think the mania can be harmful for people who are just getting into the space now.

EDIT 5: I want to bring attention to a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vgije?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in this thread made by u/Bwahehe, which is not getting enough upvotes and perfectly articulates the point I am getting across:

>ETH is like Manhattan. Horribly crowded with insane traffic, but they're doing a ton of business.  
>  
>Cardano is like someone selling a potentially lucrative spot of land but absolutely no businesses are there yet. They promise that they'll finish the roads in a month or two but they'll be some damn amazing and scientifically proven roads.  
>  
>Most up and coming smart contract coins promise massive highways and roads but nobody knows if the roads and bridges are really safe to drive on and only hydrogen powered vehicles approved by them are allowed on the roads.

EDIT 6: I'm trying to respond to everyone but this is exploding... Also, I keep getting accused of ""missing"" Cardano or ""buying it high"" or something. Guys, look at my username. [I'm all about The Graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owryqy/why_the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/) (GRT).

EDIT 7: I've been reading more and being a bit more selective about commenting back since there are just too many to keep up with and every time I refresh there's 50 more, but I'm really happy to see that the comments have shifted from price to actual discussion. Great to see! This is what r/CryptoCurrency should be all about! I like ADA, I like Charles, I want it to succeed for reasons I mentioned above.

This isn't meant to be a tribalistic war-igniting trigger post. I just think it's time to have real discussion on this sub and Cardano is the hottest topic because it is leading the bullrun in gains. Stop getting so bent out of shape, my post is not going to cause Cardano to dump, nor is it an attempt to provoke a dump. I think this is a great place for newcomers and old schoolers to join one another and discuss what they know. It's also a great opportunity for Cardano followers and supporters to counter my arguments and present their points and why they believe in the project - remember, I have not really kept up with Cardano since 2017, so I can totally be wrong about a lot of things and I accept that! The point is, this thread was a success because it reminded thousands of users here that we can still engage in high level discussions and not everything has to be about price and driving lambo rockets to the moon.

Just want to thank a few posters for their great comments including  u/orangeblack07 ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vtoat?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/todayismycheatday ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vsq6t/?context=3)), u/cali_dave ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vogw9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/OhIamNotADoctor ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vnxer?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). There are so many great comments, but as you can imagine, my inbox is absolutely obliterated and I need to go to sleep lol, so give these guys the upvotes they deserve!

EDIT 8: Last edit (I hope). Some great discussion ultimately ensued and I appreciate everyone who made thoughtful posts. I definitely don't appreciate the attacks on my character and assumptions about who I am as a person, but I guess that's part of making controversial posts like this. Had no idea it would blow up so much and did my best to answer as many comments as I can. I really hope everyone knows that I do like ADA, I do like Charles, and I hope Cardano succeeds (though I think I've already mentioned this in another of my 45 edits). I was just hoping to stimulate some actual discussion on a subreddit that is in dire need of it. Thanks for engaging me. Till next time!

EDIT 14: Lots of great comments actually made me realize I don't know the first thing about what is going on with Cardano at this point in time, I'm not ashamed to admit it. There's a lot more going on than I thought there was! I listed some of the good comments that pointed me in the right direction above in EDIT 6. Maybe I'm wrong about Cardano, maybe the slow and steady wins the race philosophy will prevail! Who knows. I'm just glad that there were so many newly introduced perspectives in this thread hidden between the shill and anti-graph\_marine brigading. I'll be eagerly awaiting the launch of their smart contract platform and dApps so that I can dabble with them myself.

Thanks again to everyone who provided quality discussion and also to anyone who gave me awards, you really didn't have to do that!

tl;dr (for those who want one) - Cardano has taken a very long time to release a product while others have thrived. People only seem to talk about Cardano during bull markets when the price is going up and I want to have a discussion about how people can think it is the end-all-be-all smart contract platform when it still doesn't have a working product. Discussion ensues. Some posters create great counter arguments and provoke thoughtful discussion while others brigade me with hateful spam.",5998,2021-08-22 04:03:49,2318

ADA,cryptocurrency,Charles from cardano was right. You need ripple to win or this lawsuit. The SEC is going to open up CoinMarketCap and start litigating down the list. Do not let tribalism get in the way of this.,"By winning the suit against ripple and the execs (for anyone who’s been following the suit ripple are absolutely smashing it) there will be case precedent. 

They will have the big fish and case law.

This means any ico or sale of crypto from the inventors of said crypto will be targeted. There’s one thing the SEC likes and that is money. 

They can see an untapped wealth of fines and settlements here and they want to be the regulator who controls crypto in the USA. You might hate Xrp, but right now ripple and their lawyers are preventing the SEC from getting their hands on the crypto market.

I have been following this case very very closely, the BtC Is The BesT tHe ResT aRe ShiTcOinS mentality is fcking stupid. If you cannot see what the SEC is trying to do here then good luck. Legit good fcking luck. EVERYONE should be paying very close attention to their strategy I KNOW those who are launching ICO's and have done in the past are and are seeking legal advice.

ADA,cryptocurrency,The fact that Cardano was in 3rd place without smart contracts proves how much this market is driven by hype.,"No I’m not here to sh#t on Cardano, I’m just trying to show how much hype is important in this market.

At some point in time, Cardano was 3rd place in market capitalization behind Ethereum and Bitcoin, yet it still didn’t even have smart contracts compared to Ethereum which already had them perfected a long beforehand.

I like Cardano a lot don’t get me wrong, butI just feel like they’re very slow with development especially compared to other chains like Polygon for example.

If anything, Polygon is WAY younger than Cardano yet it still managed to get 7000+ fully functioning dApps on board a lot of which are of very high quality actually. And quiet honestly, I think a project like Polygon is more deserving of slot at the top.

Cardano has **A LOT** of potential if only they improve their development timing. But for the current performance, I just think they’re very overhyped. That’s just my personal take though.",2049,2022-03-10 17:24:33,869

ADA,cryptocurrency,Why do people think that Cardano is faster than Ethereum?,"OK can we please have a technical discussion regarding the scalability of Cardano? Instead of the regular super highly upvoted moontalk (I know this thread will probably be downvoted to oblivion).

Cardano currently only handles 7 transactions per second on-chain. Ethereum currently handles 12-15 transactions per second on-chain. By tweaking some parameters in the future Cardano could potentially scale to 50 transactions per second on-chain which obviously still isn't enough for real world adoption. Cardano will scale off-chain with layer 2 solutions (Hydra). But they are awfully behind their competition in developing layer 2 support.

Don't take my word for it, even Cardano devs on their own subreddit admit all this.

See here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mxjf0w/psa\_cardano\_ada\_runs\_at\_seven\_7\_transactions\_per/](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mxjf0w/psa_cardano_ada_runs_at_seven_7_transactions_per/)

So why do so many people think that Cardano is faster than Ethereum?

Also, I made this same post intended to discuss the scalability of Cardano two days ago. It quickly rose into the top 50 posts until a bot deleted it from the frontpage stating ""there are already 2 posts about this coin in the top 50"". But guess what, there are always 2 non-critical moonboy posts about Cardano in the top 50. So it's very unfortunate that technical discussions about this coin have no place on [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/). I will therefore keep posting this daily, until the day a bot doesn't delete it.

Edit: Since this time, this post didn't get deleted, I will add this. I have nothing against Cardano. But I have noted that there currently exists a widespread lack of knowledge regarding the scalability of blockchains in general and Cardano in particular. This is an extremely hard technical problem that haven't been solved for over 10 years. Cardano is not offering a unique quick fix to this anytime in the near future. But I am happy that we now have more projects than ever (including Cardano) that are working on it.",2105,2021-05-30 23:49:00,925

If CPI data dumps the market, we could see a $0.30 ADA in the near future, as there is not much support below these levels.

ADA,cryptocurrency,12 reasons Cardano can't scale in 2022,"
This post is a reality check on IOHK's latest investor disinformation campaign: https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/01/14/how-we-re-scaling-cardano-in-2022/

Tldr: It's great to see they are starting to acknowledge Cardano's scalability problem, or at least pumping the brakes on their unsubstantiated claims of having solved the trilemma. For the first time, 2021 saw the Cardano community publicly acknowledge some of the limitations of their design that critics have pointed out for years. We've come a long way since IOHK was still pretending this was almost ready to go:
https://nitter.net/iohk_charles/status/1287481374224420864

**1. BLOCK SIZE/ 2. MEMORY/ 3. STORAGE INCREASES**

The bigger the blocks, the higher the memory, and the more storage- the faster the chain. Basically every chain that isn't already run on super computers can increase blocksizes, memory or storage requirements if they are OK with more centralization and less stability. That's the trade off. That's true for Cardano, and it's true for every other chain. 

But how much room does Cardano have to increase parameters? Cardano already has pretty much the same blocksize as Ethereum (72Kb vs ETH's average of 80Kb) and dramatic increases in blocksize will decrease the number of people who can afford to run nodes, and it also makes the network more likely to fork. The theoretical max limit is 28x the current blocksize, but that is almost certainly not practically possible, and no one supports increasing it to even half of that (which is about the most that has ever been tested), because increasing the blocksize isn't free. How critical is it for Cardano to maintain as small of blocksizes as possible? 

Critical enough that the plan is to only increase in 12.5% intervals when absolutely necessary. The fact that anyone is at all hesitant to increase Cardano's limit when it's 72kb tells you that this isn't a free trade. There is no plan to ever reach max parameters. Edit: they can actually increase the block size OR decrease the block time, but as they both directly factor into block propagation times, either choice produces the same throughput limit. The decision has more to do with which hardware requirements you want to increase.

https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/pf25jk/without_hydra_cardano_probably_wont_be_faster/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

What makes Cardano fundamentally slower than every other chain is how bloated their tx sizes are. We've all heard the sales pitch ""And Cardano has native tokens that don't need smart contracts!,"" but what you didn't get told is that native UTXO txs on Cardano are an average of 500 bytes WITHOUT smart contracts. And that a basic, native tx is larger than the average Ethereum tx WITH smart contracts. 

And no, the ""And Cardano can combine 20 txs into 1 !"" meme doesn't make any difference. The size and speed of each block is all the same regardless of whether you call it 1 tx or 20tx's. The only thing combining txs does is make Cardano significantly cheaper to DDOS. 

https://messari.io/asset/ethereum/metrics/network-activity

Native Cardano UTXOs are bigger than the average Ethereum tx, and Plutus smart contracts txs are even bigger that - a lot bigger- like 40x the size of Ethereum smart contracts:

**Sundaeswap determined that the Cardano network was their primary bottle neck and measured Cardano's real-world throughput for their smart contracts to be 0.15 TPS.** That's 47x slower than a native UTXO on Cardano, 100x slower than an Ethereum tx, and 66,000x slower than a Cosmos and Terra tx. 0.15 TPS is a max of 12,960 txs per day, under ideal conditions... on the entire Cardano chain. 

https://sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/expectations-congestion-mainnet-launch-e9da5abfd819

Edit: Sunday swaps medium posts are all offline now. 
https://web.archive.org/web/20220117005224/https://sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/expectations-congestion-mainnet-launch-e9da5abfd819

Cardano's problem is much bigger than anything that can be fixed with a 2x parameter adjustment. Max parameters will never be implemented, and even then, they would still leave Cardano more than 3x slower than the second slowest L1 chain, Ethereum.  

**4. Pipe Lining and 5. Input Endorsers**

...are great ideas. So why are these still in the research phase? They're promising to deliver a plan that hasn't even been designed yet. Let's assume these get designed and developed in 2022. Then Cardano is in the ballpark of Ethereum L1's low tps and high congestion. 

**6. Plutus Script Enhancements**

These are basic functions (that are still in the research phase because of how they conflict with provability in Hydra). Plutus should not even have been released before they developed reference and data inputs. That was an obvious problem, and it was a huge mistake that will create chaos and disappointment. 

Edit: putting something as basic and critical as reference inputs on the roadmap for 9 months after smart contracts are released is the definition of ""move fast and break things."" Also, nobody has explained how they solved the conflict with provability. They didn't leave it out of Plutus because it's a minor problem: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3dc6zG9EjWE&t=37m30s

Cardano will alway have much larger txs than non-UTXO chains because native UTXOs are so large. On top of that, Plutus' smart contract implementation is extremely bloated and inefficient. The problem is that Cardano's UTXO model can't store smart contracts on-chain. So instead of calling an on-chain smart contract, every Cardano SC tx must include the SC script in every tx, because there is no on-chain SC that can simply be referenced again and again. This makes every Cardano smart contract very large. 

Cardano currently does native asset txs (without smart contracts) at 7 TPS, and that's the theoretical minimum SC size, if they figure out how to compress SCs 47x. And that means that Cardano SCs will always be at least twice as slow as Ethereum L1's unbearably slow 15 TPS, for the same blocksize. 

Now is a good time to point out that it's clear from their rhetorical focus of comparing their chain to the next slowest chain, that Cardano holders have no idea how slow Ethereum is. Up to this point in time, almost all of Cardano's txs have been basic UTXO's that haven't filled up blocks, because they are a small fraction of the size of smart contracts. 

Four months after going live, no one really uses smart contracts on Cardano yet. Muesliswap doesn't even have $100 Million in TVL (and doesn't have $5M in liquidity to other tokens). Small NFT drops did bring the network to a crawl, but we haven't seen speeds across the whole network change dramatically like they will when Sundaeswap launches a real DEX and much bigger txs flood the chain Thursday. 

And catching up to Ethereum L1 will not be good enough. Ethereum has L2s already, and nobody would use Eth L1 if it went live for the first time today. Ethereum has the first mover advantage of having all the liquidity. Whales don't care about a $200 fee, they care about liquidity. They need to move in and out of large positions quickly with as little price impact and slippage as possible.  

**7. Node Enhancements**

This is not a scaling solution. Yes, fix your bugs and optimize your code. No other chain thinks a node update is a ""scaling solution."" This is ridiculous. Let me say this again: Cardano is currently 66,000x slower than Cosmos and Terra.

**8. Side-chains**

Great idea. But Cardano doesn't have any decentralized side-chains, and they didn't even get serious about funding any until late last summer. Proper sidechains are the real solution. Milkomeda is on the right track with their M1 sidechain. It's an accounts model Solidity EVM sidechain that has 32 permissioned nodes and uses slashing. Congratulations on abandoning all of your stated goals, and rushing to produce something usable. We waited six years so Catalyst could fund BSC 2.0.

https://dcspark.gitbook.io/milkomeda/our-solution-1/the-m-1-sidechain

**9. Hydra**

A comprehensive plan for interhead Hydra implementation that approaches anything close to a generalized L2 has yet to be described, let alone developed. We're still waiting for a basic description of how isomorphic state channels will ever scale dApps or have any use between untrusted parties. Hydra's 2022 release schedule is for payment channels between trusted parties. Yes, it will be able to handle smart contracts, but not any smart contracts that dApps use. Hydra heads have to be closed every time a party joins or leaves, and they have no known application for dApps. Hydra is really irrelevant, because native UTXO transfers aren't the problem right now.

**10. Off-chain computing**

>""Transactions occur outside of the blockchain itself, yet can offer fast, cheap transactions via a trust model.""

Brilliant. This is a creative solution. Off-chain **trusted** computations. *Finally something that makes sense.* Yes, Cardano users should definitely do their computations somewhere they trust, off-chain... Muhammad Fucking Christ. Let me suggest they do their computations on one of the 79 other L1 blockchains.

Edit: there's a massive difference between off-chain to a trusted party and off-chain to decentralized, trustless rollup or side chain. They are not remotely the same. That's why Sundaeswap had to come up with the convoluted scooper model and Maladex wrote a book detailing their experimental solution to countering the specific vulnerabilities of off-chain code (some of which on-chain verification will never detect). In the YouTube link above, Sebastien from DC Spark says Cardano is years away from having rollups. 

**11. Mithril**

>To achieve greater scalability, you need to address the complexity of critical operations that depend logarithmically on the number of participants.  

What? This is straight gibberish. Mithril is obviously not a relevant scaling solution. Mithril is a solution to a problem that many other chains don't even have. Even Ethereum can run a trustless lite client for nodes. Wtf does that have to do with how slow Cardano SCs are? Light client nodes don't write blocks in Cardano. Your inability to figure out a trustless lite client is irrelevant right now. 

**12. Fees**

The short term consequence of Sundaeswap's launch will be a DDOS attack. Txs across the entire Cardano network will take days to process. I predict that Sundaeswap will be forced to throttle their volume, so that the rest of the chain is usable. Best case scenario for EOY 2022, Cardano users can expect Ethereum L1 tx speeds, if everything goes right.

And Cardano has another problem they still haven't solved that Ethereum doesn't have. Slow blockchains require high fees, and Cardano doesn't have dynamic fees. Price fixing always creates shortages. They need dynamic fees. There's no way around supply and demand. Everyone has been saying Cardano's fee model wouldn't work for years. IOHK is just now taking the question seriously, and their recent moves on fees makes it clear that they have no idea what they are doing. 

People don't pay fees for fun. The fees are the only thing that make Ethereum usable. You can underpay gas on Ethereum and wait days for the tx to go through if you want, but you can't manage Defi positions or even use a DEX without cutting in line to get immediate settlement. 

It doesn't matter that txs have a deterministic order. The Cardano chain can't compute every tx (off-chain) and magically update price feeds with future prices, before the blocks are written. Even on Ethereum txs frequently fall outside of reasonable slippage in minutes. The slippage required to guarantee a tx over 24 hrs would regularly be a double digit percentage of the trade amount. And high slippage is especially a vulnerability for Cardano because so many dApps feature some risk of trusted party ordering. Low slippage is a protection against that.

Also, fees are how slow chains keep from getting Ddos attacked (RIP🏴‍☠️ NANO). If less than 13k txs take 24 hours to clear, anyone can completely stop all traffic on the Cardano network for the cost of 13k txs. And they can render it functionally unusable for a fraction of that. The Cardano community has only recently begun to admit that priority fees will be necessary, and their plans for tiered fees are poorly thought out. Search their sub for ""fees"" and read them blindly trying to reinvent the wheel. This is basic economics, and they have done no real research on it. 

For years we were told that the whole point of Cardano was to avoid launching broken products like this. Cardano's reputation will never recover from this ""Move slow and break things"" for a food DEX (that originally chose to launch on BSC). 

ADA was worth more in 2018 than it was worth during its dip last week. What coin do you think ADA holders will have to sell to buy the other half of liquidity pairs to earn rewards on these DEXs? 🤔

Cardano has not been waiting to release better designed, more secure products. Txs that take days was not part of the 4d chess plan. Look at Sundaeswap's audit and the Plutus exploit. It's the same stuff we see on other chains, plus slow txs, plus trusted off-chain elements, plus a roadmap that is critically reliant on problems that are unsolved. 

None of these problems are going away in weeks. The problem with Cardano is the complete lack of honesty from leaders and influencers like Charles Hoskinson, who regularly makes false claims, and a culture of over optimism and anti-critical thinking. Their plan isn't going well, and their jobs rely on them not admitting it.",1233,2022-01-19 12:56:04,1513

A series of fortunate events leading to vision 2025. All info is widely available and verifiable. Sources and links given below.

Ecosystem growth in 2022:

1. [10+ DEXes](https://twitter.com/cardano_whale/status/1465907181086130179)**, built from ground up**, that will specifically use the advantage of the extended UTxO model. Note the emphasizes on ""built from ground up"" meaning that [they will be different from what you're used from the Dapps on the account-based model blockchains.](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/16/architecting-dapps-on-the-eutxo-ledger/)  Benchmarking shows that with the eUTXO model, [around 25 to 30 orders can be easily handled within one single transaction.](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1475523126343741448)
2. **Borrow and lending protocols + robust DeFI ecosystem dropping in Q1/Q2 '22** after auditing and testing on testnet. Remember that it took Ethereum 2.5 years to have cryptokitties and Solana over more than a year to have some decent DApps. Cardano entered the smart contract era on 9 September 2021 so Q1/Q2 is pretty damn fast and it's gonna give a shockwave to the entire ecosystem not to mention **biggest ADA supply crunch once DExes are running at full speed**. As the DeFi ecosystem starts to take off, an alliance was announced to help speed it on its way through  standardisation and best practice -> [Cardano DeFi Alliance](https://cardanodefialliance.org/).
3. [DJED](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/18/djed-implementing-algorithmic-stablecoins-for-proven-price-stability/):  **a crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin contract that acts as an autonomous bank**. I can't stress the importance of this enough. **Djed is the** ***first*** **coin to use formal verification to eliminate price volatility.**  The first implementation of a Djed stablecoin contract was [SigmaUSD](https://sigmausd.io/#/) on Ergo.
4. [**Hydra**](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/17/hydra-cardano-s-solution-for-ultimate-scalability/) **is Cardano's solution to ultimate layer 2 scalability** that aims to maximize throughput, minimize latency,  incurring low to no costs, and greatly reducing storage requirements.  Hydra introduces the concept of [isomorphic state channels](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/299.pdf):  that is, to reuse **the same ledger representation to yield uniform,  off-chain ledger siblings, which we call Heads** (hence the Hydra name,  which references the [mythological, multi-headed creature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra)).  Specifically for Cardano, this means that native assets, non-fungible  tokens (NFTs), and Plutus scripting are available inside *each* Hydra Head.  **Many  of the transactions currently handled by the main-chain or application  running on the main chain can benefit directly from Hydra, because it  understands just the same transaction formats and signatures.**  In a layer 2 system like Hydra, it is possible to achieve **confirmation times of** ***less than one second***. Throughput measured in TPS per Hydra head is mostly limited by the available hardware. In principle, **by adding increasing  numbers of Hydra heads to the system, arbitrarily high throughput can be  achieved by the system as a whole**. ( e.g. each stake pool on Cardano could achieve about 1000 TPS there are over 3000+ stake pools on Cardano right now so when implemented you could in theory achieve 3M+ TPS = 1000 TPS/stake pool \* 3000+ stake pools)
5. [Babel fees](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/25/babel-fees/) =  **being able to pay transaction fees in custom currencies! Potential to bring all ERC-20 tokens to Cardano** for obvious reasons ([see converter in action here](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/12/07/the-agix-erc20-converter-testnet-is-now-live/))... First, let us recall how **native assets** work in Cardano: Tokens can be created according to a minting policy and they **are treated natively in the ledger along with ada**. **Cardano's ledger adopts the  Extended UTXO (EUTXO) model**, and issuing a valid transaction requires consuming one or more UTXOs. A **UTXO  in Cardano may carry not just ada but in fact a token bundle that can  contain multiple different tokens,  both fungible and non-fungible**. In this way **it is possible to write  transactions that transfer multiple different tokens with a single  UTXO.** **Transaction fees in the ledger are denominated in ada according to a function fixed as a ledger parameter**. A powerful feature of Cardano's EUTXO model is that the **fees** required for a valid  transaction **can  be predicted precisely prior to posting it. This is a  unique feature  that is not enjoyed by other ledger arrangements (such as  the  account-based model used in Ethereum)**. Indeed, in this latter  case  the fees needed for a transaction may change during the time it  takes  for the transaction to settle, since other transactions may  affect the  ledger's state in between and influence the required cost  for processing  the transaction.""
6. [**NFTs are booming**](https://opencnft.io/marketplace) and yet you only hear about ETH/SOL NFT stuff. **106M ADA traded over 9 NFT marketplaces in just 6 months!!** I expect 2022 to be a game changer when it comes to **GamiFi, DeFi and RealFi which will lead (did I mention this already :)?) to the the biggest supply crunch of ADA** since Cardano's inception.  **This means that anyone can mint their own tokens, including  non-fungible tokens (NFTs) without needing a smart contract.**
7. The first stage of the **Voltaire** era aka **Project Catalyst:** which is the **biggest decentralized fund (any chain)** right now! It has over **700 million ADA and it's used to fund all kind of projects** including some of the DEXes, NFT marketplaces, and other lending protocols mentioned above. **That's approx. 1 billion $** in our war chest to fund the devs on Cardano and create their DApps and other products. It's been successfully active for almost a year now.
8. [**Mithril**](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/29/mithril-a-stronger-and-lighter-blockchain-for-better-efficiency/) boosts the efficiency of *full node clients* or applications.  It ensures **fast and secure synchronization of the full node data,  significantly improving time and required resources including  computation, network exchange, and local storage while keeping  high-level security guarantees.** Mithril is also applicable to *light clients and mobile applications*, ensuring a trustless approach. **Another significant advantage is using Mithril signatures for running** ***sidechains***\*\*.  The main blockchain can connect to **different sidechains that can even  have different consensus protocols**. Mithril has benefits in lightweight  blockchain state verification, and thus, certificates can validate the  current state of the specific blockchain as well as the correctness of  forward and backward transfers in a secure way. Finally,  stake-based voting applications and governance solutions can use Mithril  regardless of the voting protocol’s complexity. Mithril signatures can  be utilized for secure and lightweight tally verification. This is also  useful in governance when stakeholders go through a decentralized  decision-making process and provide the final result in an easy and  verifiable way.
9. So, **sidechains and different consensus protocols you say**? Yessir, that's called **Basho** phase on Cardano. There's another cool thing from dcSpark called [Milkomeda](https://dcspark.gitbook.io/milkomeda/):  **Milkomeda will launch in both of these ecosystems (Solana & Cardano) and deploy EVM-based sidechains for each. This will aid them in acquiring existing Solidity developers out there who are interested in building dApps for whole new user bases.** With a first mover advantage for sidechains on both chains, expect to ride the initial wave of excitement and build a protocol that makes a difference and lasts.

6. [Source](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/26/africa-is-where-the-tough-get-going/): Why Africa?

If the whole world is globalizing and changing, you want to be  where all the systems are going to change first, because if you get it  right, **more wealth will be created here over the next three decades than  in Europe, the United States and China combined.** That’s just how it is.  It’s why the US got on top in the 20th century. It just simply had a  better system than the competitors. And everything resets when you have  technological change. **We now live in a global economy. People from  Africa are going to be on equal footing with people in Europe and  America if we do things the right way. And then it’s a meritocratic  race, and I’m going to bet on the people who are tougher, more resilient  and more entrepreneurial 10 out of 10 times. They’re going to win –  it’s just that simple.** 

So IOG has a pan-African view as a company. We started in a pretty  difficult country to do business in, Ethiopia, and you know what?  **Everywhere we looked, we saw well-educated, well-intentioned people who  really did want change. And they worked with us. Sometimes the system  worked against us; sometimes it worked with us. But everybody remembered  why they were there. And it was the privilege of my career to announce a  deal of five million people that could grow to 20 million, that could  grow to a national ID system of 110 million in just a few years, and  that could grow into a voting system, a payment settlement system.** It  can grow to anything. It’s kind of like the stem cell: once you’re in,  you’re in, and you can keep navigating and growing. And then how do we  take that to Kenya, to Nigeria? That’s 400 million people – more than  the population of the entire United States – within grasp in five to 10  years.

**What’s most extraordinary is that this will transform the lives of  people. Now, boring work has to be done, dry presentations given about  credential this and verification that. And they’re very necessary. But  at the core of all of that are people.**

6) [Crypto + identity solutions for Africa = RealFi:](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/25/welcome-to-the-age-of-realfi/)  By **integrating digital identity with Cardano, we can create real value and opportunity for people across the globe.**

Among nations with developed economic systems, **DeFi has  highlighted the potential for blockchain to disrupt financial ‘legacy’  systems and open up access to new users hunting for better yields and  moving liquidity** around. It has established an entirely new financial  paradigm and the **$100bn DeFi market is expected to grow significantly  over the next few years as models continue to evolve.**

However, as  much as the age of DeFi is creating fresh markets and driving  compelling new use cases, **it has also further highlighted the economic divide between people who can easily access financial products, and  those who cannot.**

**The reason why banks refuse credit or loans in emerging markets is  often that they don’t have enough data about the person or organization  intending to borrow.**

All the **necessary financial information can be stored and relayed  in a verifiable manner through an** [**Atala PRISM ID**](https://atalaprism.io/app)**.** The monetary building  bricks of DeFi can be used to structure these loans and hedge the  currency risk, while scalable payment rails provided by Cardano and  various layer 2 solutions will make it possible to transfer capital  across the world without friction.

[Atala Prism](https://www.atalaprism.io/)  is a **decentralized identity system that enables people to own their personal data and interact with organizations seamlessly, privately, and  securely. The Atala Prism team is integrating metadata to certify and  store DIDs and DID documents on Cardano.** Also, it will be possible not  only to create but also to revoke credentials such as university  certificates.

**Atala Trace and Atala Scan are being developed to  enable brand owners to improve the visibility over supply chain  processes and establish product provenance and auditability.** In these  cases, metadata integration will be used to record tamper-proof  supply-chain records.

**Cardano adds the final piece of the financial puzzle by unlocking real economic value at the end of the transaction chain:** ***personal identity...***

**Identity  is central to everything. Once someone has an economic identity, a  world of opportunity and inclusivity opens up. Real opportunity comes  with access to essential services that were hitherto out of reach. And  real finance, such as loans to open a business or maintain an existing  one. RealFi.**

**Identity can become an asset in so far as it can be a  substitute for collateral.** A lender's overriding concern is to ensure  that loans (plus any interest accrued) are paid back. One way of  enforcing this is by collateralizing the loan, but if the lender has  enough and clear information about a borrower (if they know the borrower  is a high-earner, or a long-standing customer), the lender might be  more inclined to forgo the collateral.

We have plenty in savings / investments / assets for the future, cashing out our crypto stake just made the most sense out of all options... so no, we didn't go from ""10+ year DINKs to broke in 18 months"".  We also understand an 18 month old wont remember this Christmas... obviously.  We just wanted to continue a happy foundation vs trying to scrape by the holidays with what we DO have.

You can just trust what random people on the internet say about Cardano, or...you could look at the data...","The posts on the front page about Cardano right now are bipolar as fuck. It's true...most people would probably agree that Cardano is one of the most divisive topics of discussion on this sub. I'll admit my bias for the project, but my opinions have not been formed based on rampant, baseless speculation. Let's look at the facts and the data. I believe I've been able to leave my bias out of most everything below...

&nbsp;

[Here is the Messari table for most active coins](https://messari.io/screener/most-active-chains-DB01F96B)

You can sort this table in all sorts of ways. As of today, if you sort by ""Real Volume"", ""Transaction Volume"", or ""Adjusted Transaction Volume"", you'd see Cardano ranked 3rd behind BTC and ETH. Now, some will refute this evidence of Cardano's utility by saying that Messari skews these numbers for UTxO platforms because of ""change"" UTxOs. Fair enough...let's sort by ""Active Addresses"" and we see Cardano ranked 4th at ~383k addresses, 80% of ETHs active addresses and about 42% of BTC...and this is without any DeFi projects having launched yet. You can see [here](https://messari.io/charts/cardano/act-addr-cnt) that is a growth of about 250% over the last week.
TheDeFi project with the biggest reputation at this point, SundaeSwap, will most likely launch before the end of the year. People LOVE to measure the value of a chain based on TVL, which many Cardano bears will correctly state that there is currently zero TVL. Yeah, no shit...you can't measure something before it's been created. It's like trying to say somebody will be a shit athlete before they're even born, they have to at least grow to an age where they can start participating (analogies not always my strong suit, bare with me...). Anybody calling Cardano ""vaporware"" is lying, and anyone saying it ""has no dapps yet"" is not paying attention to the activity in the community and, while true at THIS VERY MOMENT, is basically ignoring the state of current DeFi projects. Ethereum took far longer than 11 weeks for good quality dapps to get going, Cardano will have them in about 4 months time from launch of smart contracts.

&nbsp;

Ok...so Cardano is being used A LOT right now...how is it handling the load? Well, you can see [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/p_59kxcdtwnc) that the blockchain load has been steadily increasing since October. And you can see [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/s0XCC) that the number of transactions is spiking greatly. (You can adjust the graphs to an earlier date to see that the trend is increasing but I can't link directly to it). Best thing about Cardano? It was built to BEND NOT BREAK!!! There are many parameters that can be adjusted on an epoch's notice to accommodate more transaction volume. In fact, [that is exactly what is being done](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/22/slow-and-steady-wins-the-race-network-evolution-for-network-growth/). At the moment this is controlled by IOG, but when we eventually get full on-chain governance we, the community, will be in control of how Cardano adapts. 

&nbsp;

I'm hoping I've laid out the facts with evidence pretty clearly here and I think I've avoided bias. I'm not trying to convince anybody to buy or sell, I want everybody to make up their own minds based on the data. It's exactly what attracted me to the Cardano project. There are ups and downs in the market, but Cardano's design will allow it to stand the test of time because of its ""bend don't break"" approach. The demand for its use is pushing up against the flood gates and they will be opening over the next few months.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano Nominated for Blockchain Solution of the Year By CoinQuora,,1373,2021-05-07 08:41:43,420
ADA,cryptocurrency,"Cardano is coasting into an iceberg, the crew are starting to see it, but no one wants to startle the passengers by preparing the lifeboats.","Sundaeswap swap has recently released their work around for the fact that UTXO currently cannot run a permissionless, decentralized AMM DEX (like Uniswap). Items of note:

-the Sundaeswap team determined that the entire Cardano chain, without any other dApps competing for resources, will have slower **PEAK** tx speeds than half the **AVERAGE** tx rate used by one dApp on ethereum. They compared cardano's peak to the average rate on Uniswap v3 (but didn't count v2). Cardano will have options to speed that up in the future, but they are not ready yet (see second link below). And even then, cardano will still be slower than ETH, the slowest layer one chain that anyone has ever heard of. [See u/grimmergrimmergrime 's comment for an estimate of v2's speed: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qnjmby/cardano_is_coasting_into_an_iceberg_the_crew_are/hjhhfz5?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3 ] SS swap claims a theoretical max tpm of 3800 is ""impressive."" 3800 tpm is an unverified max, and it is INCREDIBLY slow for a L1. For example, it's about 160x slower than Cosmos' max tpm. 

-They accurately explain why all the other proposed solutions create vulnerabilities, weaknesses, market inefficiency, attack vectors and centralization that Uniswap type AMMs do not have

-They propose to add a novel, gated and ""trusted"" application-specific proof of stake layer with untested incentives (and untestable due to the lack of direct fee incentives on a testnet). They have determined that the best way to avoid the UTXO concurrency dilemma is to appoint third party aggregators to execute all of the orders, and ""[t]he first step is choosing trusted members of the community to run them."" So much for having the most decentralized chain. 

-They rate every solution to this problem, including their own, as requiring more development work and creating more ""surface area [that] needs to be audited"" than Uniswap. So much for the advantage of UTXO being easier to audit.

Meanwhile, Cardano devs are finally getting serious about starting the public conversation around why txs fees are necessary to avoid catastrophic network congestion, why cardano needs decentralized development, and the mistake of not having a longterm roadmap and pursuing layer 2 solutions sooner:

ADA,cryptocurrency,Yesterday marked the first Project to officially move from Ethereum to Cardano. SingularityNET has moved citing transaction speed and cost as a compelling reason to go to Cardano.,"Between May 28 and the 31st, all AGI tokens in exchange wallets or held on Ledgers etc will be converted from AGI to AGIX, so that they can run natively on Cardanos blockchain.  

This is the first project to have completed a move and I think as we have a date now for Smart Contracts (end of August) it will be the first of many.  

While ETH 2.0 will be cheaper and faster than Ethereum is now, there’s still a compelling case for projects to use the ERC-20 converter, move over to Cardano and enjoy cheaper fees, faster transactions, energy efficient network and have their token represented natively with all the same rights and priorities on the network as ADA.  

Charles Hoskinson claims there are just over 100 projects looking to move from Eth to Cardano as more functionality is added in the coming months. Whether that number changes due to updates in Ethereum 2.0’s development remains to be seen.",1158,2021-05-29 09:37:09,492

Transcript from Commercial

>America as you drink your beer and celebrate this wonderful and highly competitive superbowl. We need to talk about the Elephant in the room. While the SEC attacks staking and Ethereum - you must know that Cardano that's C-A-R-D-A-N-O, is not like Ethereum. Unlike Ethereum requiring nearly $50K you can stake Cardano with under $1. Cardano even allows you to maintain full control of your crypto in your wallet while staking, unlike Ethereum forcing you to lock it up for unknown amounts of time. While the SEC attacks staking as a service it's important for everyone to remember, unlike Ethereum, Cardano is highly competitive and the best choice for your Staking needs.  Thank you America, may the best team win.

ADA,cryptocurrency,"Cardano, which currently has no working product, is now worth more than SpaceX.","Hello folks!

Many people here have invested in Cardano because of the scientific mentality it claims to be based upon. However, I am very concerned by the actual product they have — which at this stage, is basically equivalent in function to a PoS Litecoin. They promise to create a smart contract platform, but [there is no public code for this, no testnet and no release.](https://themerkle.com/what-is-cardano-and-does-it-belong-in-the-top-10/amp/)

Cardano is vaporware. And yet right now it is valued at $33 billion - more than SpaceX, which is valued around $22 billion, and also actually does something. There is no good reason for it to be valued this high. If it had a working product, maybe. *But it doesn’t.*

I am very worried by this amount of speculation, and I would take it as a warning sign for the market as a whole. This market is becoming more irrational by the day, and it may just come crashing down.",1473,2018-01-04 03:38:39,715
ADA,cryptocurrency,The Cardano Project's work in Africa should be a reminder to everybody the real-world impact crypto currencies can have on ensuring a better future for everybody; not just the wealthy.,"\*Trying this again, as auto-mod removed it\*

&#x200B;

Let me start by saying, no I'm not a Cardano shill, and I'm not telling you to invest in it; I'm simply using it as an example here to showcase that crypto is far more than a fun thing to gamble your money on.

Cardano recently announced it's ambitions to help elevate underdeveloped nations, one way being that they want to ""bank the unbanked"". Essentially, give people access to more stable and substantial financial services, who would otherwise not have it. The impacts of this could be MASSIVE in countries that are often stricken with political turmoil and local fiat instability. This gives individual citizens, as well as bigger institutional investors a safer way to store their money if conflict or other variables threaten to devalue the local fiat.

I addition to adding an option for more stable finances, they are also hoping to lay down a foundation for African nations to take advantage of. Imagine like an Ethereum network, but with a goal of letting underdeveloped nations have a chance to utilize the full capabilities of blockchain to improve the lives of their citizens. Once example was outlined in a deal between Cardano and the Ethiopian government.

Ethiopia plans to use the Cardano blockchain to track student's progress in education, to determine how to improve said education. But just as with Ethereum and other similar networks, the possibilities are pretty unlimited. Something as simple as improving national education standards in Ethiopia would be a MASSIVE and EXPENSIVE undertaking that could never be afforded without the help of blockchain technology. And the impact of improving education could be astronomical. Seeing any movement like this makes me very happy, and very hopeful.

My point is this:  
Sure, crypto is a really fun hobby and money make for most of us. It is fun to watch the (green) charts, and read up on new projects. But lets not forget that the crypto-sphere is way more than an alternative to the stock market. Many of these projects are driven by extremely driven (possibly delusional sometimes) teams, with ambitions to make the world better for all of humankind. This is the reason I can handle the dips and red days without feeling too down about it; because I truly believe crypto and blockchain tech are the future. They will continue pushing the boundary, and could help solve some of our biggest humanitarian crises. So even if I lose some money on ambitious projects that didn't pan out, I feel good knowing that I am still an active part of bringing in a more positive future for humanity.

Fiat currency has been ruined by corrupt government and greedy corporations; crypto will certainly have it's fair share of that in the near future. I just hope we don't lose sight of the possibilities it puts in the hands of the ""non-elite""

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano Criticisms,"I'll start by saying I used to love Cardano and think it was the future of everything decentralized.  I drank all the kool-aid.  However, as of late, I've started to really get fed up with the project.  Charles is awful. Development is slow. Criticism is lacking within the community. It still has a chance to do something moving forward, but I'm not putting all my eggs in that basket.  Here's a list of criticisms I've found that hold some merit

* Peer-review: If you look at the peer-reviewed papers listed on the IOHK site, you will find that most papers are actually just sent to online repositories which state in the fine print that submissions are not peer reviewed
* Cardano literally has to write Haskell coding libraries from scratch. This slows development dramatically. Additionally, it takes 10+ years to harden a code library, meaning there will be securities concerns on Cardano for years to come.
* Charles has never actually finished a project. He seems to be a serial entrepreneur that gets rich and then moves on.
* Charles acts like he is all for unity, then goes on to trash any project that takes a different approach than Cardano.  He literally highjacked the Ethereum Classic Twitter account and swapped it to ERGO, which has a relationship the Cardano. He is simply filling his own bags.
* Having an active community on github, in reality, means nothing when projects aren't completed. Progress isn't actually made.
* IOHK might be good at science, but they have not shown they are capable of delivering practically useful products
*  In twitter polls, the Cardano community has built bots to game the results.  There are numerous twitter polls that point blank ask ""I am a human"" and ""Cardano"" and Cardano wins by a landslide. 
* Catalyst, their governance model where they award ADA, has 0 follow-through. Some projects were awarded tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of ADA, and never delivered on their promises. Basically a marketers dream
* Speed and TX fees are relatively high when compared to other smart contract chains, with the exception of Ethereum. Cardano pushes for global adoption and helping the impoverished, and then charge .17 ADA per TX, which is significantly higher than chains like ALGO, MATIC, AVAX, etc.
* Elitist community, with nothing to show to back up the elitism.

In conclusion, I hope Cardano does deliver on their promises, but the way the project is trending compared to the rest of the market and other platforms, I have  doubts about its longevity.",379,2022-10-19 21:46:29,633
ADA,cryptocurrency,Why Cardano is more Popular than XLM: Marketing,"Why is Cardano more popular than XLM?

The answer is simple: marketing.

Many people dont even know that XLM already has smart contracts and NFTs for some time.

At the same time most people know that Cardano will have smart contracts in the future.

Cardanos strength is not its features, it is marketing, Charles Hoskinsons biggest strength is advertising upcoming promises and features.

At the same time the Stellar (XLM) Foundation is very quiet about promises and advertising their crypto, while actually delivering on these features. Did you know that the literal country of Ukraine has picked them to help build their national digital currency?

If it would have been Cardano, you would hear that being hyped up for the next two years, while most people are not even aware of XLMs international partnerships.

I have nothing against Cardano or XLM and am bullish on both, but this hypocrisy needs to be mentioned.",633,2021-08-25 14:52:45,615
ADA,cryptocurrency,"11 ways Cardano will scale in 2022: Parameter adjustments, improvements, enhancements and other innovations will all play their part in steadily increasing Cardano’s capacity & throughput"," ***On-chain solutions***

**Block size increase**

The  bigger the block, the more transactions it can carry. Block size was  recently increased by 8KB to 72KB (a 12.5% increase); further increases  will be applied over time based on ongoing system monitoring and overall  network health.

**Pipelining**

Improves block  propagation times by coalescing validation and propagation. The goal is  for blocks to be propagated to at least 95% of peers within five seconds  by reducing the ‘dead time’ between blocks (the block propagation  overhead). This provides the headroom to make more aggressive scaling  changes, such as increasing block size/increasing Plutus parameter limits.

**Input Endorsers**

Input endorsers  improve block propagation times and throughput by allowing transactions  to be separated into pre-constructed blocks. This improves the  consistency of block propagation times and allows higher transaction  rates.

**Memory /CPU parameters for Plutus**

Memory  usage is more efficient across the chain. Specifically, there are  memory improvements in Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) handling, stake  distribution, live stake distribution and pools, and hash  representation.

**Plutus script enhancements**

Even more effective usage of the powerful EUTXO model through smart contract optimization, including: 

* Reference  inputs (CIP-0031)  – Plutus scripts can inspect transaction inputs  without needing to spend them. This means that it is not necessary to  create UTXOs simply to inspect the information held by an input.
* Plutus  Datums (CIP-0032) – Datums can be attached directly to outputs instead  of datum hashes. This simplifies how datums are used, as a user can see  the actual datum rather than having to supply the datum that matches the  given hash.
* Script sharing (CIP-0033) – Plutus script  references can be associated with transaction outputs, meaning that they  can be recorded on-chain for subsequent reuse. It will not be necessary  to supply a copy of the script with each transaction, hugely reducing  friction for developers. Reusing scripts in multiple transactions  significantly reduces transaction sizes, improving throughput and  reducing script execution costs.

**Node enhancements**

Improvements  will help even distribution of stake and reward computations across the  epochs, thus providing greater headroom for block size increases. Also,  memory usage is now more efficient. Memory compaction reduces RSS  footprint, and memory sharing means we need less data instantiated. Node  version 1.3.3, from January 2022, reduces peak load at critical points,  including the epoch boundary.

**On-disk storage**

By  storing portions of the protocol state on disk, nodes will need to hold  less in memory, meaning that RAM-constrained systems will be able to  run nodes provided they have sufficient storage, and memory will no  longer be a bottleneck on scalability. This will enable significant  growth in the blockchain state.

## Off-chain solutions

**Sidechains**

A sidechain is a separate blockchain connected to a main blockchain (the  'main' chain, also known as parent chain), through a two-way mechanism  (the 'bridge') that enables tokens and other digital assets from one  chain to be used in another and results returned to the original chain.  Assets can be moved between chains as needed. One single parent chain  can have multiple interoperable sidechains connected to it, which may  operate in completely different ways. EVM sidechains coming to Cardano  include dcSpark’s Milkomeda and IOG’s Mamba. 

**Hydra**

Introduces  isomorphic state channels to maximize throughput, minimize latency,  incur low to no costs, and greatly reduce storage requirements. Hydra  provides a more efficient means to process transactions off-chain while  using the main-chain ledger as the secure settlement layer.

**Off-chain computing**

Offloading  some of the computation, for example with Asynchronous Contract  Execution (ACE)  can drive greater core network efficiency. Transactions  occur outside of the blockchain itself, yet can offer fast, cheap  transactions via a trust model.

**Mithril**

To  achieve greater scalability, you need to address the complexity of  critical operations that depend logarithmically on the number of  participants. Mithril will improve chain synchronization while  maintaining trust. The result? Multi-signature aggregation that is fast  and efficient without compromising security features.

Bonus:  Plutus is basically Haskell which is native smart contract language for the Cardano blockchain. Plutus contracts consist of parts that run on the blockchain  (on-chain code) and parts that run on a user’s machine (off-chain or  client code). Both the on-chain and off-chain code are written in Haskell, and Plutus smart contracts are effectively Haskell programs.",551,2022-01-16 13:14:09,578

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano now has almost 574 million ada in its treasury or almost 1.5 billion USD to fund YOUR projects and ADA HODLers having been voting on them throughout 2021! This is how self-sustainable ecosystem with governance looks like!," Exactly   a year now ADA HODLers have been staking and delegating their ADA to   stake pool operators = validators and getting their rewards every epoch   (= 5days)  and on average yearly delegation rewards of around 5%.   Meaning that if you started with 100k ada you'll end up with around 105k   after one year... Note that the rewards from one epoch are added to  the  next and the next rewards are calculated based on that, pretty  sweet!

Cool  thing about staking  with ADA is that your ADA is never locked and you  can move it at any  time, which is not the case for ETH2 and  others...Also, pretty cool!

About 70% of the total CIRCULATING supply is staked, see [https://adapools.org/press](https://adapools.org/press) and you can imagine what that means for the price once the smart contracts drop on mainnet on 9/12!

I mean, if that was it, maybe I'd ignore it, bite the bullet and keep trading, but it isn't... the DEXes require a freakin' 2 ADA deposit FOR EVERY SINGLE TRADE!!! What the actual f***!!! 😳 🤬🙄! Plus, it's slow 🐌! Painfully slow, if the person is used to proper blockchains.

All it takes is one visit to basically any other ecosystem to realize this thing stinks. Get at me, ADA bros. You're the most confusing investors in the space. I'm literally still waiting for the deposit and I've been writing this off and on (while doing other stuff) for the last 10 minutes.

Not shilling intentionally but facts: BSC, Solana, Algorand, Polygon, Polkadot, Avax, Cosmos, Internet Computer, Hedera, MultiversX, VeChain, every L2... all of them wildly outperform Cardano. In fact, it seems that big money investors agree, as Cardano's marketcap/tvl is not only the highest in the top-25 blockchains, it is one of only three blockchains with a score in the double-digits (and both of the alts in the bottom 3 are infinitely cheaper and faster to transact on):

BSC - 11.21
Solana - 31.45
Cardano - 59.98

59.98! Think about that... 22/25 blockchains have a score of 9.99 or less and this supposed Godsend (if you ask Ada maxis) still today sits almost 6x higher in the category that quite literally is used as part of the justification for the current market cap. 

🤦‍♂️

It also has a remarkably tiny amount of stable coins on it 🤔🤨😮. $15M... I know many of you reading this don't understand just how little that is but I'll give a few examples for comparisons sake:

- ZkSync Era is ranked 1 above Cardano in total TVL and has almost 10x the amount of stables on it. It doesn't even have its own token yet! 

- DefiChain (excuse me, what? What even is that?) has the same amount of stables on it. Its mcap/tvl is 1.02. I refuse to look this chain up to go more indepth than a few baseline stats but 🤦‍♂️omg Cardano.

- Ethereum, Tron, BSC, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, and Solana all have > $1B in stables. Cardano on the other hand is down on the list with a bunch of no-names like DefiChain, Mixin, Polygon zkEVM (not regular Polygon... no... their fledgling zkEVM). Shoot, even Osmosis is less than 2.5x away from Cardano in stables and only a 40% increase away in tvl...

Cardano isn't some upstart chain. This is one of the oldest, most maxi-heavy chains in existence... The state of things today is embarrassing. Literally no one should be an ADA-maxi. It's absurd! So, please ADA bros, get at me. Explain to me and the rest of the world what it is that we're missing 🤔 😕 🙄

ADA,cryptocurrency,"Cardano teams up with Ergo blockchain, which uses UTXO-based accounting like Cardano&Bitcoin, to work on a stablecoin contract called Djed which is the first formally verified crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin contract that acts as an autonomous bank"," Cryptocurrency volatility is one of the obstacles to its wider  adoption. Blockchain technologies provide benefits such as transparency,  data immutability, and proven security of financial operations. Yet, it  is harder than fiat currencies to predict how the market will behave,  or forecast the value of a digital currency. This hinders using  cryptocurrencies as accounting and exchange units in daily operations.

A  stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a basket of fiat currencies or  a single currency (eg, USD or EUR); commodities like gold or silver;  stocks; or other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins include mechanisms that  maintain a low price deviation from their target price and so are useful  to store or exchange value, as their built-in mechanisms remove the  volatility. 

Some stablecoins lack transparency and liquidity of  their reserves, which compromises their price stability. To address  these challenges, IOG has teamed up with Emurgo, another of the three  founding partners of Cardano, and the Ergo blockchain, which uses  UTXO-based accounting like Cardano,  to work on a stablecoin contract  called Djed. Djed is based on algorithmic design. This means it uses  smart contracts to ensure price stabilization, and that the coin will be  useful for decentralized finance (DeFi) operations. 

## How stablecoins work

Different  mechanisms contribute to the stability of the coin’s value and help  eliminate price variations. These mechanisms are underpinned by the  economic principles of supply and demand. 

A common mechanism is  backing the stablecoin by a reserve of the currency used as the peg. If  demand is higher than the supply of sell or buy orders, this supply  should be increased to avoid fluctuations in the price. Typically,  stablecoin reserves are not stored in cash. Instead, they are kept in  interest-bearing financial instruments such as bonds. The returns on  these provide revenue for the operator. 

As long as the stablecoin  is fully backed by reserves in the currency to which it is pegged – and  the operator can react quickly to variations in demand – price  stability is maintained. 

## Common risks

Stablecoin reserves  are commonly associated with investments. The lack of liquidity of  these investments may prevent the operator from reacting quickly to  demand. This compromises stability in the short term.

A drawback  of fiat-backed stablecoins is that they require trust in the entities  keeping the reserves. Lack of the reserves’ transparency or of the  ‘full-backing’ claim, combined with inefficient stabilization measures,  have already caused Tether stablecoin (USDT) to fall below $0.96, as  shown in [Figure 1.](https://ucarecdn.com/20fef54f-2d33-4c16-9a74-3a74f4cb0420/-/format/webp/-/quality/best/-/progressive/yes/)

 Issues of transparency do not arise when the backing asset is a  cryptocurrency on a public blockchain. Furthermore, the use of smart  contracts ensures efficient and reliable execution of stabilization  measures due to its automated and secure mechanisms.

## Enhanced stabilization mechanisms of Djed algorithmic stablecoin

Djed is a crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin contract that acts as an autonomous bank. It operates by keeping a reserve of *base coins*, and minting and burning *stablecoins* and *reserve coins*.  The contract maintains the peg of stablecoins to a target price by  buying and selling stablecoins, using the reserve, and charging fees,  which accumulate in the reserve, as shown in [Figure 2](https://ucarecdn.com/8fac023c-68b9-4fbc-9ad3-9c8d2005c544/-/format/webp/-/quality/best/-/progressive/yes/). The ultimate  beneficiaries of this revenue stream are holders of reserve coins, who  boost the reserve with funds while assuming the risk of price  fluctuation.

 The Djed stablecoin is designed as an asset pegged to a fiat  currency (USD), along with a governing algorithm. This approach provides  a stable means of exchange. But Djed is not limited to being pegged to  the dollar. It can work with other currencies, as long as there are  oracles providing the contract with the corresponding pricing index.

## The first formally verified stablecoin protocol

Djed is the first *formally verified*  stablecoin protocol. The use of formal methods in the programming  process has greatly contributed to the design and stability properties  of Djed. Using formal techniques, the properties are proven by  mathematical theorems:

* **Peg upper and lower bound maintenance**:  the price will not go above or beyond the set price. In the normal  reserve ratio range, purchases and sales are not restricted, and users  have no incentive to trade stablecoins outside the peg range in a  secondary market.
* **Peg robustness during market crashes**: up to a set limit that depends on the reserve ratio, the peg is maintained even when the price of the base coin falls sharply.
* **No insolvency**: no bank is involved, so there is no bank contract to go bankrupt.
* **No bank runs**:  all users are treated fairly and paid accordingly, so there is provably  no incentive for users to race to redeem their stablecoins.
* **Monotonically increasing equity per reserve coin**:  under some conditions, the reserve surplus per reserve coin is  guaranteed to increase as users interact with the contract. Under these  conditions, reserve coin holders are guaranteed to profit. 
* **No reserve draining**:  under some conditions, it is impossible for a malicious user to execute  a sequence of actions that would steal reserves from the bank.
* **Bounded dilution**: there is a limit to how many reserve coin holders and their profit can be diluted due to the issuance of more reserve coins.

## Djed versions

There are two versions of Djed:

* **Minimal Djed**: this version is designed to be as simple, intuitive, and straightforward as possible, without compromising stability. 
* **Extended Djed**:  this more complex version provides some additional stability benefits.  The main differences are the use of a continuous pricing model and  dynamic fees to further incentivize the maintenance of the reserve ratio  at an optimal level.

## Implementations

IOG, Ergo, and  Emurgo teams have been working on the implementation of the Djed  algorithmic stablecoin contract earlier in 2021 to test different  models. 

The first implementation of a Djed stablecoin contract was [SigmaUSD](https://sigmausd.io/#/)  on Ergo. This was the first algorithmic stablecoin deployed on a  UTXO-based ledger in Q1 2021. It had a fee of 1% for buying or selling  operations, and an oracle that updated the exchange rate every hour.  This initial version was subject to a reserve draining attack by an  anonymous user who owned a large number of ERGs (Ergo’s native coin).  The attack was ultimately unsuccessful, and it is estimated that the  attacker lost $100,000. 

To further discourage such attacks, this  initial deployment of Minimal Djed was replaced by a version where the  fee was set to 2%, the oracle updated every 12 minutes, and every oracle  update was allowed to change the price by at most 0.49%, unless the  price difference was greater than 50%. This provided stronger resilience  against reserve draining attacks.  

Djed has also been  implemented by the IOG team in Solidity. One version uses the native  currency of the Ethereum blockchain as a base coin, and another uses any  ERC20-compliant token as a base coin. So far, these implementations  have been deployed to testnets for Binance Smart Chain’s testnet,  Avalanche’s Fuji, Polygon’s Mumbai, Ethereum’s Kovan, Ethereum’s  Rinkeby, and RSK’s testnet.

## Djed: Cardano implementation

The  Alonzo update to Cardano will enable smart contracts using Plutus.  Plutus is powered by Haskell, which guarantees a safe, full-stack  programming environment.

Draft implementation of an earlier version of Minimal Djed is [available in the Plutus language](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-use-cases/src/Plutus/Contracts/Stablecoin.hs).  In this implementation, stablecoins and reserve coins are native assets  uniquely identified by the hash of the monetary policy that controls  their minting and burning according to the Djed protocol. This  implementation also assumes that oracle data such as the exchange rate  is provided as signed data directly to the transactions, instead of  being posted on-chain.

There is also an ongoing OpenStar  implementation. OpenStar is a framework for private permissioned  blockchains developed in Scala. The implementation of Djed using  OpenStar follows the idea of off-chain smart contract execution to have a  stablecoin on Cardano that does not depend on smart contracts executed  on-chain.

To find out more about Djed stablecoin, see the [recently published research paper](https://github.com/input-output-hk/djed/raw/main/papers/Djed.pdf) or check out the [presentation by Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zG-rxMCDIa0&t=8366s), IOG technical director, at Ergo summit 2021.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Researching L1s and can’t quite place Cardano.,"Bitcoin is king but it’s interesting to study other L1s and I’ve primarily been diving into the Ethereum and Solana developer ecosystems. 

Ethereum, as is well known by now has such an extensive and flourishing developer environment. There’s so much being built and the tooling is pretty mature at this point, making it easy for new developers to enter the space. 

Solana is exciting too, but you can tell developers are more hardware focused, attracting a lot of former Apple, Tesla and SpaceX devs. However, it’s easy to forget how tiny the eco system is compared to Ethereum, or even some of the Ethereum L2s. But cool things are being built and deployed and while I’m a lot less familiar with the Solana tooling, it seems to attract projects wanting to build upon the Solana blockchain. 

I then tried to do a similar case study on Cardano, but I’m finding it a lot more challenging. It’s very possible that I’m just attacking it wrong. But where there are loads of developer conferences for both Ethereum and Solana where it’s pretty clear how the respective blockchains differ from each other and where their focus is, I’m not really seeing the same in Cardano, apart from the Cardano Summit (which seems primarily to have been virtual?). From the surface it seems people are more focused on developing Cardano than developing on Cardano.

Please provide arguments and facts and not some vague narrative of 'best decentralized staking' or something else. A data driven approach on the amount of use cases so far would be appreciated. Saying that smart contracts are almost there etc. etc. is not an argument. Even if thats true thats literally just the beginning. That means nothing. Being happy that smart contracts are coming in a few months after starting around the same time as Ethereum is extremely worrying of how serious 'investors' are here.

Edit 2: Ok forget my responses. Just please read through all the answers and tell me how convincing this all is. Do all of you see a pattern here?

Edit 3: Publishing scientific papers is nothing fancy. I dont know why people keep mentioning this as if its something special. Algorand, Ethereum Zilliqa etc. are also doing this. Also, its only worthwile *if its implemented in reality and isn't just stuck in theory*

Edit 4: Finally 1 good argument in almost 400 comments. Which is ""Implemented native multi assets"". This is actually a useful feature and good use case to increase the value of Cardano. Btw, please stop automatically assuming that everything Cardano has built is already the best. You dont know that. It has not been battletested yet. Its all assumptions and speculation.

Edit 5: To be honest, I am kind of dissappointed in this subreddit. For months I have been wanting to write a post like this but thought maybe others will. But literally 100s of Cardano post and nobody ever asked 'but what have they done so far'? And this is suppose to be the main cryptocurrency subreddit? This just means there is barely any critical discussion going on. Its a bit insane to me that so many people invested in Cardano but can't barely even answer basic questions and just personally attack me because 'I'm jealous' or whatever. But I guess its going up in value and they figured out the right marketing formula. Feels like EOS all over again. But at least EOS launched lol.

**Edit 6**: Ok this will be my last edit. I just want to leave everyone to think about what's going on. Its always easy to sell a dream than to sell something that is functional and being used. Selling a dream about the future you can exaggerate and you cannot dispute. You can make it as big as you want it to be and if enough people believe it it can get some kind of 'cult like' charisma. But think about this. This is a team with billions of funding. Hundreds of people working on it and it is one of the oldest teams in crypto. Having so much money and people should speed things up, not slow it down. Do you really think that they can keep up with the story they are telling after showing barely anything for the last years? There are teams like Aave with 20 million of funding that have done more in less time with a much smaller team. Just please think about this. Forget about the money and market cap and promises.

# The Collapse of Terra/Luna shocks the Crypto Market.

In May 2022 Terra Luna was one of the biggest and most well known crypto plays. The crypto consisted of two parts:

1. A Cryptocurrency called: Terra
2. A StableCoin called UST:

Terra could be treated as a speculative Crypto investment, or it could be converted into UST ""A stablecoin"" with 20% interest.

The two were supposedly algorithmically pegged, in the event UST lost value and depegged from $1 a repeg could be reestablished my taking money from Terra to get the value back to $1.

But... What happens when UST depegs and people also lose trust in Terra? The answer is a death spiral, and that is exactly what happened in May of 2022. First UST depegged and lost it's $1 peg, than Terra began to mass inflate decreasing the value of all other Terra tokens. This caused more people to want to get out of UST and resulted in a complete collapse of both projects.

CoinDesk has an in depth article on this subject: [Here](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/the-fall-of-terra-a-timeline-of-the-meteoric-rise-and-crash-of-ust-and-luna/)

Many crypto projects were taking advantage of the supposedly safe 20% yield that UST offered and this single event cause shockwaves through the entire crypto ecosystem with many Crypto entities failing or going bankrupt as a result.

Barry Silbert the once famous CEO of Digital Currency Group was one of many organizations to fail after the collapse of Terra and UST.

# FTX Goes out of Business

FTX was once the #3 Crypto Exchange behind only CoinBase and Binance. Towards the end of 2022, it was discovered that FTX was padding their books with their own exchange token FTT. This questionable financing lead to many users doubting the liquidity of FTX and created a run on the exchange.

A few days later FTX declared bankruptcy and it was discovered there was a multi billion dollar hole of user assets in FTX.

# The End of an Era: Binance CEO CZ steps down and pleads guilty

After the collapse of FTX, CZ Binance famously said that 2023 would be full of FUD and he would respond ""4."" to FUD.

https://preview.redd.it/4z4a8pfbqdmc1.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&s=d33a1f3562d038a823b06333b403ba67ee598cdc

What wasn't FUD is that Binance was a shady organization that aimed to put Corporate Growth over Compliance. At the end of 2023, CZ stepped down as the CEO of Binance and plead guilty to not following anti-money laundering policies.

Over the coming days lots of evidence would come out showing CZ knowing allowed high value criminals to use their platform for the sake of profiting from them.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano - Step by step guide to staking ADA,"Cardano, and its native coin ADA, is one of the most solid blockchain platform projects currently. The team has shown repeatedly that they can deliver on their promises and the project is famous for being backed by peer-reviewed research. Exciting news are coming for this project so be sure to check their website [https://cardano.org](https://cardano.org) and their roadmap [https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/).

This post will be a step-by-step guide to staking your ADA. There are various ways to proceed but we will be using the **Yoroi chrome extension**. Additionally, although not required, it is **highly recommended to use a hardware wallet**. Any of the following will do:

* Ledger Nano S
* Ledger Nano X
* Trezor model T

This guide will cover the following:

1. Set up the Yoroi google chrome extension
2. Connect or create your ADA wallet
3. Send ADA to your wallet
4. Choose a stake pool and delegate your ADA
5. Staking rewards

# 1) Set up the Yoroi google chrome extension

First of all, we need to install the Yoroi Chrome extension. Navigate to the official wallet page [https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/) and download the extension.

&#x200B;

[Download the Yoroi Google Chrome extension](https://preview.redd.it/qg5evijpl9w61.png?width=1267&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c7f1f64edf61e9aab53ccffc52422579f4c1b5)

Once dowloaded, you will need to click 'Add to Chrome' and 'Add extension' to enable the extension in Chrome.

It will then appear in the top-right corner of your Chrome browser (click the little puzzle piece icon) and you may want to pin it to keep it visible.

&#x200B;

[Shortcut to the Yoroi extension](https://preview.redd.it/8ecdgxntl9w61.png?width=326&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b77ff98d2e77b7999d034346da8ef4deb134b03)

Now you can launch the Yoroi extension and, as this is the first time, we will need to go through a few setup steps:

* Choose language
* Agree to the terms and conditions
* Choose 'Simple' level of complexity
* Skip 'Cardano payments URL' and confirm (you can always set it up later if needed)

That's it, the extension is ready to use and your home page should now look like this.

&#x200B;

[Yoroi wallet home screen](https://preview.redd.it/rsutop7vl9w61.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=66e90e3c773afef5225494bd1c808165ff5617ca)

# 2) Connect or create your ADA wallet

The safest option at this point is to use a hardware wallet. If you do not have one yet, you can always create a local wallet to start with (and and transfer your coins to your hardware wallet when you do buy one).

# 2.a) Connect to a hardware wallet

I will use the Trezor model T to illustrate but the Ledger Nano works similarly

* One the home screen menu, select 'connect to a hardware wallet',
* Select 'Cardano'
* Select your hardware wallet type: either Ledger or Trezor
* Choose Shelley-era wallet, as we want to be able to stake
* Your hardware wallet needs to have already been initialised, press 'Next'

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2gn4kmrwl9w61.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c79fe239e5b7691504cb808998406fdf900b070

* Now, make sure your hardware wallet is connected to the computer and unlocked, press 'Connect'

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fqtxyesxl9w61.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=3021abf0a96c419a95c29bdcd2575a2f7d477f96

* A new page pops up to ask you to transfer your public key to the wallet. This is expected as the public key allows you to receive money to your wallet. Note that the private keys never leave your hardware wallet. Now click, 'Export'

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a7bg4hvyl9w61.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=af7e7cd73343e4e803797abd151a2f85d74f6423

* Then, the wallet name, retrieved from your hardware wallet, will appear. Click 'Save' to complete this step and reach the Yoroi dashboard.

# 2.b) Create a local wallet

This section is only if you do not own a hardware wallet and want to use a software wallet instead. If you own a hardware wallet and have completed step 2.a, you can skip this section and proceed to step 3.

* On the home screen menu, select 'create wallet',
* Select 'Cardano'
* Choose 'Create wallet'
* Enter a wallet name and a strong password, then 'Create personal wallet'

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lk699320m9w61.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=58fd77bf09890ddc655590c92ec9f1cf840b4626

* The next step will give you your 15 words seed phrase. Make sure to write it down (on paper, no electronic support) and to keep (several copies) safe and labelled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3cwl5x21m9w61.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&s=091cc3fb943d0775033ca00fd20ef9388660b67f

* Once you have written it down, you will be asked to enter it to check you have it correctly.
* Now you can confirm, your wallet is created and you are taken to the Yoroi dashboard.

# 3) Send ADA to your wallet

Welcome to your Yoroi dashboard.

&#x200B;

[Yoroi dashboard](https://preview.redd.it/szzqx7d2m9w61.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd301b23c37296518447beeee0df735e33d55833)

In order to transfer ADA to your wallet, simply go to the 'Receive' tab in order to copy your address. You can then use this address to transfer the ADA you will have bought in your favourite exchange. Note that ADA transaction fees are rather low at roughly 0.17 ADA.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zgghlhj3m9w61.png?width=1238&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f71d4a58885bcbbb9c0c8008d0635a84baf13ee

# 4) Choose a stake pool and delegate your ADA

From your dashboard, we now move on to the 'Delegation' tab.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fthbb2r6m9w61.png?width=1231&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d326a09dd1e5653bf5dfe98f9e4a9656ea6d21e

Here, we need to choose a staking pool from the list. If you do not know yet which pool to use, the best thing to do is to navigate to [https://pooltool.io/](https://pooltool.io/) in order to find a staking pool that you like, more on that later.

Once you have chosen a pool from the list, simply click 'Delegate' and confirm. You will also have to confirm the delegation with your Trezor/Ledger if you are using a hardware wallet. That's it, you're all set and you should see the total ADA delegated onto your dashboard. A few things to note:

* you can only delegate to a single pool
* but you can cancel the delegation or switch pool at any time, there is no lock-up period
* there is a 2 ADA staking fee registration that you need to pay the first time you start staking, so you do not need to pay it again in the future if you switch pool or add ADA to your wallet
* any ADA sent to your wallet will automatically be staked in the pool you have chosen
* similarly, the rewards are automatically added to your wallet and thus the interest is compounded.

Now the remaining question is how to choose a stake pool. The first thing to keep in mind is that there is no risk associated with staking ADA and the worst that can happen is that you do not receive any reward. First of all, we need to consider the following

* **Epoch**: the staking rewards are computed for each epoch, which lasts 5 days.
* **Fees**: each pool will charge a fixed fee (typically 340 ADA per epoch) and a variable fee (aka pool margin). The fees will not be taken from your wallet and you can only earn ADA by staking. The fees are charged to the total amount earned by the stake pool during the epoch and then, the remaining is distributed among the participants of the pool proportionally to their contribution to the stake pool. In the example below, there will be 9,000 ADA left to be distributed to the members of the pool:

&#x200B;

|Total pool reward (example)|10,340 ADA|
|:-|:-|
|Fixed fee (340 ADA)|\-340 ADA|
|Left after fixed fee|10,000 ADA|
|Variable fee (e.g. 10%)|\-1,000 ADA|
|Left after all fees|**9,000 ADA**|

&#x200B;

* **Saturation**: in order to discourage centralisation, the concept of saturation decreases the amount of reward to too large pools. Currently, the saturation level is 64M ADA. This means that you should not stake your ADA to pools where the staked amount is more than 64M ADA.

Now, let's go to [https://pooltool.io/](https://pooltool.io/) to select our pool.

&#x200B;

[A few stake pools on pooltool.io](https://preview.redd.it/wnv8xzahm9w61.png?width=1285&format=png&auto=webp&s=14ad9703b6d6f0bcc42ef5967b236ac97e91d8b6)

The important fields are the following:

* **Pool ID:** you can copy this address to paste in your Yoroi delegation tool once you have selected the right pool
* **Epoch Fee:** these are the fixed fees and should be 340
* **Variable Fee:** you want to avoid too large fees but it is also worth paying a bit more to join a pool that you trust. Be aware that some pools are effectively closed and thus charge a 100% fee. Note also that some pool will have a very low, even zero, fee to help them grow but it might be increased in the future.
* **Declared pledge:** the amount pledged by the pool operator at the time of creation of the pool, not massively important for the pool selection.
* **Epoch ROS:** the expected annualised return in the current epoch, this will typically be around 5%.
* **Live stake:** the total amount staked in the pool, it is important that this remains under the saturation threshold of 64M.
* **Lifetime ROS:** the historical return of the pool, this shows you past performance of the pool.

There is also an official calculator to compute your expected rewards depending on the various parameters: [https://cardano.org/calculator/?calculator=delegator](https://cardano.org/calculator/?calculator=delegator) .

# 5) Staking rewards

The staking rewards are paid with a three epochs delay. This means that you do not receive any reward for the first 15-20 days but you keep receiving rewards for 15-20 days if you cancel your delegation.

The rewards are paid at the end of every epoch (for the amount you delegated three epochs prior), hence every 5 days. The typical APY will be around 5% but the rewards are spread over 365/5 = 73 payments. Consequently, the average rewards per epoch is approximately

&#x200B;

[Average reward per epoch](https://preview.redd.it/1v9htknkm9w61.png?width=204&format=png&auto=webp&s=be842927c1319a7cca337d7908ac1a986c300ebd)

For example, this is **approximately 0.68 ADA per epoch per 1,000 ADA delegated**.

&#x200B;

[Average reward per epoch for 1,000 staked ADA](https://preview.redd.it/73y0pu5mm9w61.png?width=214&format=png&auto=webp&s=42a245321926fc974676355c7b984f5bef041667)

I hope you will find this guide helpful.

# Edit

Adding a small edit to discuss a common question in the comments: many people are asking how this compares with staking directly on Binance. The decision is up to you, I will simply list a few pros and cons.

Pros of staking on Binance:

* Binance allows you to stake directly on the exchange which is certainly easier to set up than the above. 
* Moreover, Binance claims to be able to provide a better return than the 5% you get when staking through Yoroi.

Cons of staking on Binance:

* ""Not your keys, not your coins"": the coins are held by Binance rather than safely in your hardware wallet. Therefore, you are at risk of losing them: Binance servers could go down, be hacked, ...
* Staking in smaller pools helps with the decentralisation of the network. Staking in the large Binance pools is against the spirit of the project.
* Another minor point, Binance proposes locked staking so you do not always have access to your coins contrary to the above staking method where there is no lock-up period.

----------

# Advantages

#### **Parallel processing from the UTXO model**

There are 2 ways to store users’ balances. The simpler and more intuitive model is the account model. This model is like how you have an account with a balance at a bank account. It’s very simple and easy to understand.

The other model is the UTXO model which is what Cardano uses. This model is more like a list of coins with the current owner of the coins. When users want to spend a coin, they will destroy the coin(s) they own and create new coin(s) with new owner(s). The new coin(s) need to have the same value as the destroyed coin(s).

This model is more complicated to understand at first, but when it comes to parallel processing, the UTXO model is much simpler. If you have 2 transactions trying to spend different coins, you can easily have different cores of a processor process each transaction. It’s only in cases where two transactions are trying to spend the same coin that you need to have agreement between the nodes on the order they came in.

With the account model it is more complicated to parallelize transactions but newer chains like Algorand and Solana have done it which makes the UTXO model less of an advantage compared to before.

#### **UXTO’s and state bloat**

The UTXO model also seems like the easier model to prevent state bloat. Cardano has set it up so that the more data you want to store in the UTXO set, the more ADA is required in the UTXO. This sets a limit on the maximum state size so prevents the state from growing too large. State bloat is a big issue with EVM based chains so this is a big advantage.

#### **Native assets**

Compared to the typical ERC20 style smart contract for managing secondary tokens in the network, native assets are a nicer solution.

Native assets have a much better UX as they are treated as first class citizens of the chain and don’t need things like setting approvals which is an annoyance with ERC20 tokens.

They are also much cheaper to use than ERC20 tokens as they are just a field in the UTXO instead of a smart contract that you need to interact with.

#### **Easy to verify (Good decentralisation)**

It’s very easy to verify the Cardano blockchain. Block sizes are small and occur roughly every 20 seconds. To verify the correct staker posted the block, you just have to verify a simple verifiable random function. This means you can run a Cardano node on lightweight and accessible hardware which allows for high decentralisation.

Currently the node specs might actually be too low. One of Cardano’s main selling points is using the UTXO model so it can do parallel transactions however nodes only require a 2 core CPU. Parallel processing is not much of an advantage with only 2 cores so I’d expect node specs to increase a bit in the future.

#### **Low to zero inflation rate**

Cardano’s current inflation rate is only 3% and is expected to slowly drop to 0% by around the year 2050. This inflation rate is already pretty low so gives Cardano good tokenomics for potentially being a store of value.

#### **Fairly good distribution**

It’s not as well distributed as Bitcoin or Ethereum but compared to the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, Cardano tokens are well distributed. Distribution tends to get better over time and generally more distribution happens when the price goes up. ADA is now a fairly old token and has gone through multiple hype cycles so should be fairly well distributed.

The initial distribution of tokens is not bad either. Again, not as good as Bitcoin or Ethereum who mainly distributed via mining but compared to most cryptocurrencies, not too many tokens went to the founders and VC’s. Most tokens were distributed via a public ICO which is the second best way after mining.

#### **Large development fund**

If you are not the first mover who already has the majority of developers, having the funds to develop the protocol and ecosystem is important.

Network effects are incredibly important for blockchains. Dapps and users attract more dapps and users to a chain. However it’s incredibly difficult to attract developers and users away from the status quo in the first place so being able to tempt them with money to bootstrap the ecosystem is a valid strategy. Cardano has a sustainable source of funds to do this through its treasury which gets built up through fees.

#### **Designed for robustness**

Cardano uses a consensus method called Ouroboros which is based on the longest chain style of consensus methods. Longest chain methods tend to be more robust than BFT based methods as they don’t need to receive a vote from every single participant to stay live and instead just use probabilistic finality based on how the recent participants have voted with their blocks. BFT style methods will shut down if more than 34% of the participants are offline but longest chain methods will keep going even if 99% are offline, albeit at a much slower speed.

----------

# Disadvantages
#### **Slow**

When you use the longest chain model for consensus, you get improved liveness but generally sacrifice speed. However, even taking that into account, Cardano is slow to reach a solid level of finality.

Consensus methods are voting models. With longest chain models, every time there is a fork, each validator votes on the chain they want to win by adding a block to the chain they prefer. Whichever chain ends up longest will have had the most votes so will be the winner.

The problem for Cardano is that only 1 validator votes every ~20 seconds and each vote doesn’t have much voting weight behind it. Ethereum also uses the longest chain model but each block added has many validators attesting to it so has much more voting weight behind it.

With Cardano, every epoch, a random set of validators, based on their stake, are selected to produce blocks/votes. These chosen validators will have 100% of the voting power within this epoch. For Cardano, an epoch 21,600 blocks. This means there are 21,600 votes over the epoch, each one represents 1/21600 or 0.0046% of the voting power for the epoch.

Ethereum has 100% of validators split into 32 equal committees every epoch and each committee is responsible for producing a block/vote. For Ethereum, an epoch is 32 blocks. This means each block represents 1/32 or 3.1% of the voting power.

It would take almost 4 hours for Cardano to have the same amount of voting weight on a block as Ethereum does after one 12 second block making it 1200x slower.

This method of comparison probably isn’t the best but it’s very hard to find a good way to model the voting weight for each Cardano block.

#### **Low Throughput**

Cardano is currently not scalable at all and is in fact one of the lowest throughput chains in the space being only able to handle around 7tps of basic transactions and more like 1-4tps when smart contract transactions are mixed in. Bitcoin which is known for low throughput does 7tps.

Increasing the node specs and future updates like Input Endorsers should increase the throughput significantly so it should get better over time. However, it’s unlikely to compete with high throughput chains like Algorand or Solana unless it makes the same sacrifices to decentralisation as them.

#### **Lack of actual finality**

Longest chain models do come with the major advantage of being robust but this comes at the cost of only having probabilistic finality.

More modern PoS longest chain models such as the ones used in Ethereum, Polkadot and Near, tend to use an Ebb and Flow model where they use the longest chain model to produce blocks but also have a BFT finality gadget running on top of it to provide finality. These models get the benefits of the longest chain model whilst also being able to provide finality.

Cardano does not have this and should think about adding a finality gadget on top of Ouroboros. There’s little to no downside of the Ebb and Flow model compared to a pure longest chain model.

#### **No priority mechanism**

Cardano has static fees. If there are more transactions than the network can handle then people don’t pay higher fees but instead join a queue and just have to wait. ~~The mempool for Cardano is not that big so the queue gets full quickly. This means people have to keep posting their transaction over and over until there is room in the mempool again.~~ (edit: it looks like I used old info here. Nodes can make their mempools bigger.) There is no in-built method to guarantee your transaction reaches the blockchain during times of congestion.

If this scenario were to play out for a significant length of time, you will end up with users contacting stake pools directly and giving them a fee to guarantee their transactions will be included in blocks. If there is demand for block space, people will be willing to pay extra to get it, even if it’s outside of the protocol.

Fee markets are inescapable if there is not enough supply to match demand so whilst Cardano may not have an on-chain fee market, an off-chain fee market would develop if people actually used the chain. If a fee market is inevitable, it’s better to have it on chain where it’s transparent and fair.

#### **Concurrency issue**

Every block, each UTXO can only be spent by 1 person as when they are spent, they get destroyed. For simple transactions this is fine. If you own the UTXO then being the only person who can spend it is not an issue.

However smart contract UTXO’s are UTXO’s that can be spent by anyone. If more than one person within a block wants to interact with a DEX to buy a token, they can’t. The first person will spend the UTXO destroying it so the second person can no longer interact with it. This means you can’t have multiple people concurrently interacting with a smart contract per block.

To get around this limitation, apps have had to force users to interact with them off chain using centralised services. Here they are more prone to censorship or things like sandwich attacks.

The concurrency problem is not something that is unavoidable with the UTXO model. FuelLabs have created a smart contract language using UTXO’s that don’t suffer from the same issue but they sacrificed being completely deterministic to do it. Cardano could go in the same direction to get rid of this issue. The current situation where users are forced off chain already sacrifices determinism for users so FuelLabs’ UTXO model seems like the better option.

#### **Hydra as the main scaling method**

If you are unfamiliar with Hydra, I have a video explaining how it works here:
https://youtu.be/Mx79j_-HRmk

Hydra can give potentially unlimited scaling between a small group of users as long as they are all online, have powerful enough computers to do it and are in complete agreement with each other. However the use cases for this are limited.

It’s very difficult to keep a large group of people in complete agreement over something for long periods of time and you are always prone to trolls who just like to disagree for no reason. This limits the number of people per Hydra head to around 10 people which limits its use cases.

Many dapps have community owned assets like liquidity pools which users interact with for things like trading or taking loans from. You can’t move these pools to hydra heads so the heads are limited to whatever assets the group of users bring with them. This means that the majority of defi is not possible on Hydra.

State channels like the lightning network (BTC) and Raiden (ETH) have largely been a failure but it looks like Cardano is still pursuing them heavily with Hydra. It’s hard to see why Cardano has so much confidence in a technology that doesn’t have a good track record.

Hydra is meant to be made up of two parts, Hydra heads and Hydra tails. Very little information has been revealed on Hydra tails so maybe they have something up their sleeve that will solve the problems with Hydra heads but we will have to wait and see.

#### **Sidechains for scaling**

Sidechains also seem like a big part of Cardano’s scaling roadmap. Sidechains don’t share security with Cardano and each sidechain needs to find its own security. This is incredibly difficult. Not only do side chains need a token with a large market cap, they need it to be well distributed as well if they want a good level of security. This is not an easy problem so the number of secure side chains will be limited.

Again, this is another technology that the rest of the crypto ecosystem has tried and deemed not good enough but Cardano seems to be spending a lot of resources pursuing them.

#### **No slashing**

If you are a staker then no slashing will be an advantage for UX but staking is meant to be about security first and foremost and slashing brings added security to the protocol. Proof of stake protocols that don’t implement slashing are more open to bribe attacks or collusion between validators. In Cardano, if a validator adds a block to 2 conflicting forks there is no punishment.

If consensus methods are voting models and validators are being paid to choose a side, shouldn't there be a punishment if they vote for both sides?

#### **Delegated stake being more prone to bribery attacks**

If I am running a staking pool I may have staked with just 1 ADA out of my own tokens and have 64,000,000 ADA delegated to my validator node. In this scenario, I will have little alignment with keeping Cardano secure and yet I will have quite a bit of power within the ecosystem.

If an attacker came along with a large bribe for helping with an attack, it would be rational behaviour for me to accept the bribe. I don’t have a lot of tokens locked up that can be slashed and I don’t care if my 1 ADA loses some value.

No slashing combined with the majority of stake being delegated and not owned by the validators makes Cardano more prone to bribe attacks than other proof of stake protocols that do have slashing and don’t have delegation.

#### **Untested by actual users**

Cardano may spend a significant amount of time researching the best ways to do things but this has meant it doesn’t really have real world experience on what is needed. When I look at Ethereum or Solana’s roadmaps I see things addressing MEV and fee markets due to the unpredicted ways in which users used their chains.

For Cardano there’s nothing on MEV. Barely anyone is using Cardano so they don’t have a problem with it but if they ever start to get an active DeFi economy they will realise it’s inevitable and something that will need to be researched. We’ll then have to wait years for a solution to be researched and built.

When I look at Ethereum L2’s, I can see they already tried building state channel solutions and plasma chains which failed. Them failing with these experiments completely changed their roadmap and was one of the best things that happened because these failures eventually developed into rollups.

Cardano decided it wanted to use state channels with Hydra years ago and is only trying it now. The ideas it is developing haven’t actually been tested in the real world.

-----

# Conclusion

Despite listing a lot of disadvantages here, I actually like Cardano. The tokens are fairly well distributed, they prioritise keeping node specs modest and they value robustness. Their core values are great.

They also actually try different things. They aren’t trying to recreate Ethereum with slight improvements. They have their own methods for trying to achieve the same goals.

Unfortunately, different is not always better and they have been very slow to implement their ideas. To me when I look at Cardano I see a chain that is trying to become the ideal cryptocurrency from the ideas available in 2015. The rest of the space has largely moved on from experimenting with side chains and state channels but Cardano has not.

So whilst the core values may be good, they are too slow at implementing them. The rest of the space is racing ahead. By the time Cardano will have completed its roadmap and realised it’s not good enough, other projects will already be far ahead.

Looking at it as an investment, Cardano has largely lived on hype. Reality will never match the hype so when it launched smart contracts that didn’t solve all the world’s problems, it was seen as a disappointment.

I struggle to see Cardano being able to generate as much hype as it did in previous bull cycles. It can no longer live on the promise of smart contracts and Hydra solving everything as these both now exist on main net and neither have lived up to the hype. For this reason, I see it struggling to reach the same heights in the next bull cycle unless it gains significant adoption.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano is currently the most expensive smart contract blockchain (and other reasons I'm bearish),"Cardano currently has the most expensive fees of any smart contract blockchain. While this is probably temporary due to low ETH activity, ETH currently has cheaper fees than Cardano despite having 10x the daily active wallets, 400x the DEX volume, and 31x the average TPS of Cardano.

Minimum transaction fee on Cardano is $0.06 (0.17ada). On Eth $0.03 https://etherscan.io/tx/0x73bf5f439d98b48552f726e0895d550eb298e4dc766608c5e32a3cc977929614

Minimum DEX swap fee on Cardano is $0.45 (1.17ada). On Eth $0.32 https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8fda8034129413e448b0004bab26aa699015949e8abbf24303b557c4bbc64bc6

Cardano averaged 0.4tps in the latest epoch (504). Cardano community often excuses low TPS with ""transactions within transactions"", but EVERY chain supports this. For example this TX has 61 recipients but only counts as 1 transaction on Ethereum: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8d296e3cc8cac4651579bb8d54f5452502abe81a72853fc53f67a78a57680d17 (Also this would cost 61 ADA on Cardano because you need to attach 1ada for each recipient when sending CNTs)

Cardano security budget is currently paid with 99.5% inflation and 0.5% user generated transaction fees (see Cardanoscan epoch 503 for proof). Even if blocks were 100% full Cardano wouldn't be economically sustainable.

For some reason Cardano has a higher % of closed source apps than any other ecosystem, which goes against the ethos of blockchain and decentralization.

The largest ""DEX"" on Cardano (Minswap) is centralized, partially closed source, and can be frozen at any time (already happened once).

The largest lending app on Cardano (Liqwid) is centralized, closed source and can be frozen at any time (already happened once).

The largest stablecoin on Cardano (iUSD) is centralized (oracle) and has been depegged for almost a year.

Plutus V2 and Aiken upgrades were supposed to be a big TPS boost, but weren't enough of a TPS boost to avoid major congestion during the launch of the Butane token, Kiseki meme token, and Axo token during Axo prelaunch (these are the ones i personally experienced, there are probably more).

Cardano's upcoming L2 Hydra scaling solution has a limit of 20 members per instance (due to transaction limits when opening a channel), and all members must REMAIN ONLINE for it to work. In addition Hydra can't be used for DEXs or anything involving liquidity pools.

Governance is soon coming to Cardano but less than 2k people participated in the community vote leading up to governance.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano is very much in the spirit of bitcoin,"If you put aside your tribalism towards this certain coin and negative feelings towards Charles Hoskinson (and I agree, he is a controversial figure) and just delve into the tech you will see that Cardano is very much in the spirit of bitcoin.

Some examples:**The eUTXO model:** Bitcoin uses the utxo model (instead of the global state/accounting model Ethereum and many other blockchain's use).This model was adopted by Cardano and extended (eUTXO) to add a turing complete scripting language. In bitcoin there is also a scripting language but it's not turing complete (curious fact, it is harder to create a non turing compete language. For example, turing complete languages were sometimes created by mistake when some tech was created!).It is true that this scripting language in bitcoin was non turing complete by design but I see Cardano's extension as the next logical step.

**Consensus mechanism:** The most important thing about the consensus algorithm is that it's secure and decentralised. Cardano's Proof of stake algorithm is proven to be at least as secure as Bitcoin's proof of work algorithm. Also, It can even be said that Cardano is **more** decentralised due to it's many pools/evolving governance/etc...

All in all, I really think that there is a lot of merit to Cardano if you look objectively into the tech.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Our beloved Cardano (ADA) Successfully Launches Testnet That Will Bring Ethereum Tokens to Its Ecosystem,"**Cardano (ADA)** developer Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) is announcing the successful launch of a test network (testnet) to allow **Ethereum-based** tokens to migrate to the **Cardano blockchain**.

IOHK [says](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/12/07/the-agix-erc20-converter-testnet-is-now-live/) that it is initially partnering with decentralized artificial intelligence network [SingularityNET](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/singularitynet/) (AGIX) in the initiative.

*This marks a significant step forward in driving interoperability between blockchains to establish a functional environment for decentralized finance (DeFi).”*

The testnet is a working prototype and paves the way for the mainnet, which is the ready product. The mainnet converter will be launched “soon after” the testnet, per SingularityNET CEO and chief scientist Dr. Ben Goertzel.

According to IOHK, the testnet converter transforms Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens into native tokens on the Cardano blockchain. An ERC-20 token is a standard used to create and issue smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

The Cardano developer also says that the sixth-largest blockchain by market cap is also working on connecting to other decentralized protocols.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano does not have USDT and USDC because it adheres to the principles of decentralization at the protocol design level and does not allow token issuers to censor transactions. Ethereum/Polygon/EVM USDT & USDC solidity contracts can freeze your funds and zero out your balance.,"**Cardano** employs a so-called **multi-asset ledger**. **Tokens are stored directly in the ledger and treated similarly to ADA coins**. **No smart  contract is needed to mint tokens on Cardano**. Issuers must define a minting policy script and sign a specially created mint transaction. 

To issue tokens on EVM platforms, it is necessary to deploy a smart contract, which is then used for transferring tokens. The token issuer can define support for transaction censorship and token freezing in the  contract. Let's explore how the two approaches differ and think about  what Cardano should be.

TLDR

* USDT and USDC can only be issued by complying with the requirements of the regulators.
* The ecosystem's dependence on a stablecoin that can be frozen at any time by a centralized entity is very dangerous.
* Cardano does not have USDT and USDC because it is unable to meet the requirements of the regulators.
* **Owners are always in full control of their tokens in the Cardano ecosystem. Even the issuer cannot change that.**
* It can't be said that Cardano has fewer capabilities than EVM platforms just because it doesn't allow transaction censorship.

Regulatory Compliant Stablecoins

The  issuers of the well-known stablecoins USDT and USDC had to comply with  the requirements of regulators in order to be allowed to tokenize USD on  blockchain platforms. It's important to note that this has brought huge liquidity to the ecosystem and stablecoins are one of by far the most  used tokens. DeFi ecosystems definitely benefit from the ability to use  this kind of stablecoins. Unfortunately, and users are not always fully  aware of this, this comes at the cost of violating the basic principles  of decentralization.

 See for yourself what the smart contract for Tether USD contains.

**How is it actually possible to censor transactions on EVM-compatible platforms?**

When people want to mint fungible tokens on Ethereum, they use standards like ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155. These standards are essentially smart contracts. Smart contracts define a common list of rules that EVM tokens should adhere to. A customized and deployed smart contract is then used each time tokens move from address to address. **A smart contract can define any behavior that EVM will allow and this can be the ability to censor transactions based on a blacklist or freeze an account. The owner may lose the ability to spend or use the tokens in any way.** 

 A deployed smart contract can never be stopped or otherwise manipulated by a third party. **Ethereum** and other EVM-compatible platforms are mostly decentralized at the network level. **Token issuers, however, can write whatever they want in smart contracts**, including the things described above. 

**People sometimes ask why Cardano doesn't have USDT and USDC. Cardano is unable to censor transactions or freeze an account. All tokens have exactly the same properties as ADA coins.** Transfer of tokens is done directly by the protocol through transactions. 

**Cardano has an accounting infrastructure for assets defined in the ledger model and can transfer tokens and NFTs natively. Tokens are stored directly in the ledger similar to ADA coins.**

**No smart contract is needed to mint tokens on Cardano. Issuers must define a minting policy (monetary script) and sign a specially created mint transaction**. The rules might specify who (what private key owner) has control over the asset supply through minting and burning. The owner of the private key (issuer) can only burn tokens that he has at his address. 

**It is not possible to affect the existence of tokens at other users' addresses in any way. In other words, the issuer is not able to burn coins remotely or restrict the token owner from signing the transaction and sending the tokens.**

Once the tokens are minted, Cardano does not need any smart contract to interact with the tokens. All the logic for transmission, transaction fee calculation, etc. happens at the protocol level, similar to sending ADA coins. **Owners are always in full control of their tokens and the issuer cannot change that.**

Cardano stablecoins like [DJED](https://cotinetwork.medium.com/why-djed-should-be-referred-to-as-an-overcollateralized-stablecoin-and-not-an-algorithmic-332637d1e741), [USDA](https://emurgo.io/emurgo-introduces-first-usd-backed-stablecoin-for-the-cardano-ecosystem/), [iUSD](https://indigoprotocol.io/) are native assets i.e. you have full custody and they can't be frozen.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano community we need to talk.,"Yesterday I posted a thread about Twitter users experiencing some problems with early DeFi projects running on the Cardano network and since then I have been accused of being part of a “coordinated” FUD campaign aimed to damage the Cardano project by the Cardano community and the YouTube Channel ‘Altcoin Daily’.

The thread I made yesterday was not meant in anyway to spread FUD about Cardano in anyway. It was solely to discuss the problems some Twitter users had with Cardano DeFi projects and I asked if someone more tech savvy and more  experience with Cardano  tech can further explain the problem that Twitter users reported. 

Since then, I have received hostile messages from a lot of Cardano community members and even the popular YouTuber ‘Altcoin Daily’, accusing me of spreading “coordinated FUD” against Cardano. 

There is 0 proof that this is a coordinated FUD attack on Cardano and the fact that the youtuber ‘Altcoin Daily’ is accusing me of spreading FUD and having “proofs”, which absolutely is not true, is just plain slander against me. 

I find it very toxic how hostile and aggressive the Cardano community responded to my thread and how the YouTuber ‘Altcoin Daily’ is accusing me doing a coordinated FUD attack. If he has proofs he can show them, or I will take legal action against him for accusing me of spreading misinformation in a coordinated matter.

Edit: I tried to communicate in a civil manner and tried to address the FUD accusations. I got downvoted to hell, threatened, gaslighted, and called a lier and FUDer.

I will clarify it once again to everyone.

I did NOT aim to spread FUD against Cardano.
I am NOT part of some group or a coordinated Cardano FUD attack campaign.
I NEVER intended to damage Cardano. 

If Altcoin Daily has any proofs that  tried to FUD or that I am part of some group or coordination against Cardano then he shall present these proofs or delete the video of him calling me a FUDer, liar and manipulator and apologize.",214,2021-09-06 01:03:59,448
ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano DeFi is having a bull run within a bull run! ADA will be unstoppable in the coming bull run!,"Let's go back to '21, no smart contracts, no DeFi, no DEXes... ADA at 3$.

The smart contracts era came to Cardano in September '21.

Fast forward now, in just 2 years the Cardano DeFi is booming and it's been booming throughout the bear market times as it can be seen on this [defillama chart](https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano?currency=ADA).  No other major blockchain (ETH, SOL) witnessed a TVL growth in the native currency during the bear market like Cardano did.

https://preview.redd.it/qu2ovp3p045c1.png?width=1613&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a1218b9d507fddb2ddae3c61fe457aeff418adc

For the first time ever, Cardano just entered the top 10 chains by TVL in $ as it can be seen on this [defillama chart.](https://defillama.com/chains)

https://preview.redd.it/c8cic3u3345c1.png?width=1607&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b941f18172700e87ddbea529ac60e25fdc8b39e

Note that Cardano has no USDC or USDT options like other chains so to be in the top 10 is an incredible achievement. It has 2 stablecoin options which are still limited though: DJED (overcollateralized algorithmic stablecoin) and iUSD (synthetic $ asset). Most tokens on Cardano DEXes are still priced vs. ADA.

Cardano had its own memecoin mania called $SNEK back in May '23 during the deep winter of the bear, look at the volume then. The mania with Cardano native tokens started again in December and the daily volume on DEXes is exploding as it can be seen via [taptools.io](https://taptools.io) data.

https://preview.redd.it/wtsbxr3p145c1.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a38acbae14cbde6ea89578e261812b54178ff9d

Besides the memecoin $SNEK , the gaming tokens on Cardano will be the next big thing during the next cycle like DEADPXLZ's $DING and some others like $CLAY, $COPI...

$LENFI, $LQ, $INDY are lending and borrowing protocols +- similar to AAVE or Compound...

The top 50 tokens are really diverse and can be seen on [taptools.io](https://taptools.io) site.

https://preview.redd.it/v7us0h9o145c1.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=0755bf292484a7abd99d54fc40dc2f9fb6c015f7

This time Cardano has a thriving ecosystem with multiple lending/borrowing protocols, synthetics, stablecoin options, DEXes and aggregators, great NFTs and gaming projects. The new teams and new projects are popping up like crazy and people are just coming up with new crazy ideas to harness the magic of Cardano's unique eUTXO model bringing the enterprise grade trading experience (check out [axo.trade](https://axo.trade) for example) like you're on a CEX. Also, options, indexes, baskets, perpetuals, you name it, it's there or in the pipeline for coming months!

So, if you're wondering why ADA price is going up, it's because, this time for the first time Cardano is actually totally ready for the bulls and it will probably be one of, if not, THE best performing major crypto asset this coming bull run!

ADA,cryptocurrency,Charles Hoskinson of Cardano (ADA) calls for togetherness in crypto community,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson held a [session on YouTube yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jex6wItSvzE) to answer pressing questions from the community.

&#x200B;

**Gap due to tribalism**

During the livestream, Hoskinson gave a wish list of what he would like for Christmas; he did not ask for physical gifts this time. Instead, Hoskinson decided to name a pressing problem in the crypto space and that is the growing gap between investors of different projects due to tribalism.

&#x200B;

**Lots of similarities, but still lots of hate**

Hoskinson is done with the hate and actually wants everyone within crypto to get along better.

&#x200B;

'All I want for Christmas is for everyone to get along in our industry. It's extraordinary to me that when people are so close in philosophy and views, and in some cases technology, they can be so far apart as individuals. It's extraordinary.

&#x200B;

**Crypto is different**

Hoskinson finds it strange that investors in crypto are so different and so more emotional than in other industries. There is much less hate in other places.

&#x200B;

'You don't see this in other industries,' Hoskinson said. 'You don't see this in physics, or biology, or cell phone manufacturing, or whatever, pick an industry, the amount of tribalism, hatred and vitriol that our industry has for each other.'

&#x200B;

He went on to explain that as long as people continue to hate each other, there will be no way to fight the real enemy: the legacy systems. He said that this system holds three billion people and will continue to do so. The founder also acknowledged that this will not be easy because there will always be people trying to divide others in space.

&#x200B;

**More collaboration in 2022**

He also sees that there are books and podcasts that say things to divide people. Especially on social media, he sees the community being divided.

&#x200B;

'That has to stop and the only way it will stop is if we get better systems that are fairer. The only way we can do that is by working together. We'll see if that's achieved in 2022.'",293,2021-12-09 20:28:23,270

Djed is a decentralized, algorithmic stablecoin that is built on Cardano. An algorithmic stablecoin maintains stability through a combination of collateral and a reserve token. In this case, Shen is Djed’s reserve coin and has the role of ensuring price stability — specifically it guarantees the collateralization rate and the peg of the stablecoin.

Furthermore Coti holders will also benefit as a portion of the transaction fees go into Coti funds.

ADA,cryptocurrency,"The dust has settled. From a user perspective, Cardano has the better Proof of Stake model.","I feel like I have to preface this with the empirical fact that the last few crypto purchases I've made, and indeed the majority of Crypto I've bought in the last year has been Ethereum. I'm a fan of Ethereum. I'm a believer in Ethereum. But ETH 2.0, for the every-day user, is quite a let down.  


# #1 Minimum stake

ETH 2.0 chose to bizarrely lock out the vast majority of Crypto users and require a minimum amount of 32 ETH to stake, currently valued at $46,624. This is supposed to be a decentralised platform and yet, the people who before could buy a GPU for $700 and mine and earn an ROI are now locked out. The only choice left is to either stump up $46,624 in ETH and become a validator yourself, which puts your funds at risk of slashing if you don't have business-class Internet stability, or you can *literally send your Cryptocurrency out of your own wallet in exchange for something like RocketPool's version of ETH*... hang on.. that sounds a lot like trusting your funds to a third party.  

On the other hand, Cardano's minimum stake is 5.5 ADA, plus the transaction fee of 0.17 ADA. That's currently $2.75.  

# #2 Decentralisation  

Currently, [two entities are producing the vast majority of blocks on ETH](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*uxWfMLmwWUso36GrmswpIQ.png) - Lido & Coinbase. While this problem is inherent to Proof of Stake networks (and not forgetting how a few entities produce the majority of Bitcoin hashrate) Cardano fares much better here - With the largest single entity (Binance) [only controlling 11% of the active stake](https://adapools.org/groups).

# #3 Rewards  

Current pro-rated calculations are putting ETH's staking reward's at a 4% ROI. Cardano's ROI averages at 5% but if you select a decent unsaturated staking pool, it can go as high as 7-8% ROI.  

# #4 Staking liquidity  

What prompted this post was the discovery that, as of yet, there is no timeline on how people who staked $46,000 to ETH can withdraw these funds.  

I've seen estimates placed at between 1-2 years which is when the Shanghai upgrade is due to be finished. 

> Staked ETH cannot be unstaked or transferred on the Ethereum network until after the Shanghai upgrade. This means that clients should only stake ETH that they plan to hold long-term  

Let's compare with Cardano: 
 
* Your funds **never** leave your wallet when you stake.  
* Your stake automatically increases or decreases as you receive / spend ADA
* Staking rewards automatically compound  
* You are free to change Staking Pools at will with no penalty at a cost of 0.17 ADA. 



To me, this absolutely kills all credibility for ETH being for anyone other than the rich. You cannot stake to ETH unless you are rich or are willing to risk your funds. You cannot perform transactions on ETH, particularly when congested, unless you are willing to spend on high transaction costs. You cannot withdraw your funds because the developers didn't think that might be a priority for anyone.  

I mean, what the fuck, really? You can say what you want, ghost-chain this, Hoskinson that, but surely even ETH maxis can give credit where it is due. Cardano got this right years ago.",99,2022-09-17 22:01:44,372

The project seems very promising and I could see it someday overtaking ETH in market cap. I’ve decided to invest lots of money in it , which I hope is not a mistake.

ADA,cryptocurrency,"The ugly parts of using Cardano: UTXO limitations, minADA, locked ADA, and collateral","**Disclosure:** Am disappointed long-term ADA user (and small bagholder)

There are a lot of good things about Cardano like high decentralization and deterministic fees (mostly deterministic, since [Phase 2 Tx validation can still fail](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/collateral-mechanism/)). Ultimately, adoption requires good user experience, and I don't think Cardano will ever get there. There are many ugly user experiences to using Cardano that all stem from its use of UTXOs instead of global accounts.

Swaps still require off-chain operators due to concurrency issues, but I think end users have mostly gotten used to them. There are bigger UX annoyances.

**Minimum 1-1.5 ADA per transaction UTXO**

If you've used Cardano, you've probably noticed that tokens lock 1 to 1.5 ADA with them, and wallets usually have 5+ ADA locked up as collateral before you can perform any DeFi transaction (due to the risk of Phase 2 validation failure). dApps can't update token, NFT, and SFT balances without sending the token along a minimum of 1-1.5 ADA in a UTXO. Each Cardano UTXO has a [minimum amount of 1 ADA](https://forum.cardano.org/t/minimum-ada-per-transaction/55109/2). For NFTs and tokens, wallets usually usually lock [1.5 ADA](https://forum.cardano.org/t/nft-minimum-utxo/51839/7) with each token UTXO since there are other factors that affect the minimum amount like utxoCostPerWord.

Imagine if 1 ADA rises to $10 in the future, raising the minimum UTXO amount. Cardano would be unusable. It's not super easy for it to reduce this minimum because the purpose of Min-ada-value is to prevent UTXO bloat. (Edit: I originally wrote spam, but UTXO bloat in memory storage is more accurate).

**No global accounts and simple balance updates**

In addition, accounts aren't global, so there's no good way of tracking user progress. This is better for privacy, but not good if you're trying to build a decentralized identity. Each Cardano wallet is just a collection of UTXOs and lacks a unified account. The staking address is useful, but it's not completely unified. There are 4 different types of Cardano addresses (base, pointer, enterprise, reward account). Not every address can have a pointer to a staking address or uses the same staking address. This severely limits POAPs, airdrops, gaming, and DeFi swaps. Airdrops and POAPs usually check an account's DeFi progress, but without accounts, how can the airdrop owners figure out the activity of those users? Tracking is also inefficient since you can't simply query a single account or contract to get the balance.

ADA,cryptocurrency,The hate on Cardano is unjustified.,"I understand the legitimate concerns but man does it feel like the majority of criticism against Cardano is brainless especially when every project has their own legitimate concerns. People are either misinformed or pull random facts out of their butts. No Cardano won't fail just because you FOMOed in near ATH, no Cardano doesn't suck because it surpassed your favorite project despite not having a dex and no Cardano doesn't suck just because it doesn't give you any huge returns yet. If you care about returns, zoom out and look at the bigger picture. 

Cardano has always been a slow project, it was always meant to be a long-term investment with long-term goals. The cryptospace is filled with people looking for a quick buck who couldn't give a rats ass about the tech and honestly, what did I expect? If you invest before doing any research about the project, tough luck. 

Someone made a beautiful and thorough post about Cardano the other day. It talked about Cardano's goals for Africa by 2025 and real world change in general, heck their involvement in Africa has already begun. Cardano is a promising project and if successful, millions of people all over the world will be granted access on a scale most projects could only dream of. 

The main take from this is that Cardano is not to blame for your misfortunes with the project, it's your impatience.",194,2022-01-02 19:29:32,257
ADA,cryptocurrency,PSA: Cardano (ADA) runs at SEVEN (7) transactions per second. Full sources and calculations in comments.,"There are 3 things that determine transaction speed: block size, block time and transaction size. Let's look at all 3 for Cardano.

1. Block size. The maximum size of a block is 65536bytes.

Here is the source: [https://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-initial-updatable-parameter-values/42261/3](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-initial-updatable-parameter-values/42261/3)

If you scroll down you see the variable ""maxBlockBodySize 65536"" and it is helpfully explained ""Maximum size of a block body. Limits blockchain storage size, and communication costs.""

2. Block time. This is 20 seconds on average. Can't find a great source for this as the block time jumps around a lot on the explorers but Google give you loads of sources e.g. [https://uk.advfn.com/crypto/Cardano-ADA/fundamentals](https://uk.advfn.com/crypto/Cardano-ADA/fundamentals)

3. Transaction size. It varies but it is around 500 bytes often more. Go here [https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html) and look at the number of transaction in a block and its size, divide.

&#x200B;

So to calculate tps we do: 65536 / 20 / 500 = 6.55tps.

&#x200B;

The Cardano sub is aware of the issue see here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lh21a5/someone\_help\_me\_figure\_this\_out\_max\_tps\_under/](https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lh21a5/someone_help_me_figure_this_out_max_tps_under/) where this issue was discussed quite technically.",169,2021-04-24 12:55:09,385
ADA,cryptocurrency,Why is Cardano so popular?,"I'm always researching smart contract chains, in particular ALGO, EOS, Polkadot and Cardano. I'm trying to figure out why Cardano is so vastly popular compared to other coins.

For example, Cardano has a comparible market cap to Polkadot (DOT), but its subreddit has \~300k members vs Polkadots \~20k. It seems like they have almost equal market cap, and are at similar points in development (Cardano smart contracts vs Polkadot parachains). ADAs subreddit has about half of /r/ethereum which has been around forever and dwarfs the other two in market cap.

Not hating on ADA or DOT technology. I'm just trying to understand why one seemingly has an order of magnitude larger community when everything else seems roughly equal.",204,2021-04-06 15:46:18,336
ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano's Vasil Hardfork upgrade has deployed successfully! Find out what this means for Cardano,"Cardano's newest upgrade in the Basho (scaling) era is the Vasil upgrade, named after the late Bulgarian mathematician Vasil Dabov who was a respected member of the Cardano community.  

##What does the Vasil upgrade do?  

The key component of the upgrade is to make Cardano's transaction sizes smaller. In layman's terms, previous transactions were filled with some fluff which bogged down the available space in each block. With the Vasil upgrade, each transaction takes up less space and therefore more of them can fit into blocks. This also makes running different types of Smart Contracts a lot easier than before, which was one of the main complaints from developers.  

This is because of 'reference scripts' where a transaction can include a reference to a script on a previous transaction, thus preventing the same code being written into multiple transactions.  

It's important to note that while the upgrade was executed without issue, it's because of extensive testing. Earlier this Summer, a critical flaw was found and it was uncertain whether it could be fixed in time for the previously scheduled deployment of the Vasil upgrade.  

---

One more thing to remember is that this won't be a snap-of-the-fingers speed upgrade for Cardano, the Smart Contract developers must also upgrade their code too - however, a majority of developers have already signaled readiness for the Vasil hard fork so we should see some good improvements soon.  

---

And to get in before everyone else (phrasing), yes, the Vasil hardfork is like adding Vasiline to the Cardano network. I'll see myself out!",273,2022-09-22 22:18:09,144

ADA,cryptocurrency,Will DOGE be worth $100 a coin? Can it become as big as ETH? Could Stellar Lumens be worth $1000 a coin? Will Safemoon make me rich?? We all need to look at total supply vs market cap to manage our expectations and be more logical about what is possible.,"The answer to all of those lofty expectations? Impossible. This is a mistake a lot of people are making. You have to look at total supply and multiply it by price per coin to get the market cap. Let’s look at a few popular ones…

Bitcoin is rare like gold, difficult to mine like gold and is used as a store of value like gold. As it becomes more scarce, it will continue to rise in price. It has a total supply of 21 million, of which 18 million are already circulating. After the 21 million are mined, there will be no more available. 18 million x $57k means it has a market cap of over a trillion dollars. That is huge. The total market cap for ALL crypto is 2.38 trillion. Bitcoin is king. Bigger than Visa and MasterCard combined. Bigger than nearly every world bank. It is the world’s 3rd largest currency. 

Ethereum has a total supply of 115 million. More coins than Bitcoin. At the moment, it allows for 18 million to be mined each year max. In July, they are making a change with the London Hardfork, EIP 1559, and every time a transaction is made with ETH, the ETH fees will be burned, making the supply more limited and much more valuable, similar to BTC. Many are saying that ETH will go up to $10k per coin this year because of these changes. When ETH 2.0 is released next year, the price will probably go much higher. With 115 million in circulation, ETH has a market cap of $400 billion. That’s worth more than all of Walmart. 

So, it is really important to check the coin supply and then multiply that by the price you wish it would go to to make you rich. See if the amount seems realistic or not. 

Let’s look at DOGE. Doge has a total supply of 127 billion coins and a max of 10,000 are mined each day [EDIT: DOGE mints 10,000
coins every *minute*, not every day!]. That’s an additional 5 billion coins each year. If you multiply 127 billion coins the $100 you wish it were per coin, it would have a market cap of $12.7 trillion dollars. There is $37 trillion dollars in the world. Is DOGE worth 1/3 of all the money in the world? The entire economy of the United States is $25.3 trillion. Is it realistic to say a meme coin is worth roughly half the US economy…the largest economy in the world?

Let’s take a look at Stellar Lumens. The max supply is $50 billion. The supply increase is 500 million a year, which alone is 23 times the total amount of BTC each year. Anyway, if it were $1000 per coin, the total market cap would be $50 trillion, more than double the US economy. At the very most, maybe they could be $10 each? I say it could be worth $10 because it has actual utility. I think DOGE would top out at $1, and that would be pretty crazy. 

If DOGE were worth as much as ETH, which I’ve seen people on the doge subreddit think might happen, Doge would be worth a modest $388,720,000,000,000. $388 trillion. That’s at least 3 times all the money in the world economy, if Google serves me right.

Then you have to be really careful of coins that are just a rug pull and get promoted on Tik-Tok, like Safemoon. I don’t even need to do the math on Safemoon to know it’s a scam. They will get people to throw all their money into it and then they cash out their supply and take everyone’s money. The total supply for Safemoon is 1 quadrillion coins!!! Stay away from that. Insanity. 

Look at supply of successful coins beyond BTC and ETH and see if you think they could be worth a lot more in the future. Here are some I think worth investing in:

Polkadot (DOT): Total supply: 935.5 million, total supply 1 billion

Chainlink (LINK): Total supply: 419 million, max 1 billion

Cardano (ADA): Total supply: 45 billion. This coin has many great uses, but will not be worth as much as others simply because of the number of circulating coins. Maybe $10-$12 a coin max? But it is under $2 right now. 

ATOM: Total supply: 248 million. New coins are created each year as rewards for people that hold (stake) ATOM. If you can find a good coin that gives you APR, many are 5-6%…much better than a traditional savings account! 

Algorand (ALGO): 2.96 billion, also releases new coins as rewards to people that hold ALGO. 

Tezos (XTZ), circulating supply: 756 million. Total supply: 763 million. 

MANA: this coin is only used for a video game called Decentraland. Atari is making a casino opening in May in that virtual world. Supply available: 1.5 billion. Total supply: 2.6 billion. 

Polygon (MATIC): 10 billion, half in circulation. Because there is a max supply of 10 billion, if it grew to the size of ETH…which won’t happen…each coin would be worth $35 a coin (Take the market cap of ETH and divide it by the supply of MATIC to see what it would be if it were as huge as ETH). It’s under a dollar now. Maybe it could grow to 1/4 of ETH if we’re being optimistic? That would put it at $8.75 a coin. 

Enjin (ENJ) 1 billion coins max, 834 million circulating. 

The list goes on, I just picked a handful of random coins I hear mentioned a lot, but all you need to do to check out what a realistic expectation for a coin is is to take the current supply of tokens, multiply it by what you wish the coin was worth and compare the market cap to BTC or ETH’s market cap, over a trillion and $400 billion, respectively. I don’t expect any alt coin to be worth as much as those those two. And, it bears repeating, the entire cryptocurrency market is worth 2.38 trillion. If you calculate that your coin at $100 is going to be worth double, triple, or quadruple that, I’d say that’s an impossibility. Likewise, you can do the math the other way to see what your coin would be worth per coin if it were as big as ETH or BTC by simply dividing the market cap for ETH or BTC by the number of coins circulating for your prospective coin. Your coin won’t grow as big as those two, but it’s a good way to visualize it and manage your expectations. 

(Note that some of my supply numbers might be off a little, but they should be in the general ballpark)",15395,2021-05-06 02:01:00,3145

TVL and daily users are the most important factors when analyzing a chains usage and popularity. Base has also overtaken optimism in total daily transactions which is an impressive feat for a new chain. Bases initial growth spike is due to many projects choosing to launch on base chain rather than other layer 2s.

I'm one of these Cardano investors who was trading very happily with ADA until the crash that stuck us on the 0.35-0.45$ area. Welp, that sucks.

So despite my very calm investing strategy is to analyze trendings and wait for the price to reach what I expect, I have to accept that ADA is very unlikely to recover the ""golden age"" it once had. And despite I'm not one of these who put their life savings in crypto, it still sucks.

**So, what strategy would you follow in my situiation? I'm interesting on hearing your thoughs.** 

On average, I bought Cardano at a price of **1.51$.** For the time being I have a trailing order that triggers at 1.5$, as I would be happy enough if I recover what I invested. 

As an investor I try to avoid high risk options such as futures. I like to simply buy low, place a trailing order to sell, wait for the notification to execute, trailing order to buy lower, rince and repeat.

This is the boat I believe ADA is in. It isn't all just about the tech. Smart contracts are currently not as big in the world to the point where superior tech makes that big of a difference (hence why all the other ""Ethereum killers failed"" even with better tech). Ethereum has such a huge network effect as well as first-mover advantage where I can't see it getting flipped any time soon, especially with EIP 1559 coming out in July and ETH 2.0 being fully released (within a year?). At this point, most people/whales that are buying ETH are not in it for the tech but for what it is - the second most valued crypto (and generally more stable than the altcoins).

Withdrawing ADA on Binance, until 2 days ago, would ""only"" cost 1 ADA.

They increased it to 3 ADA yesterday, and some time between yesterday and today they increased it further to 5 ADA.

That's a 400% increase in less than 48h. For comparison, transaction fees on Cardano are only 0.17 ADA.

And yet, after a user from r/cardano enquired about this issue, Binance claimed that the 5 ADA fee ""depends on the blockchain and miners"" (Miners on Cardano? Am I missing something?).

Proof: https://ibb.co/5k0MMpq

EDIT: proof of higher fees https://ibb.co/b6X5zh3

This is disgusting.

They're promoting their BNB coin boasting about their low fees, making other coins like ADA look like much less appealing alternatives.

For the sake of the free market, and to prevent Binance to pull off any more shady stuff á la Robinhood, please consider complaining to Binance about this.

Not cool Binance. Not cool.

EDIT: at the time of writing, the fee is down to 2 ADA (I'm based in UK if it matters). They keep changing it, fuck knows why",5368,2021-02-10 20:40:19,895
ADA,cryptocurrency,Many ADA holders are deranged cultists. This is the reason why I think it is the safest bet right after the big two.,"ADA holders can be really weird. I want to reiterate that not all of them are like this, but the Venn diagram of ADA fans and neck beards, who start discussions about the age of consent in japan, looks like the Mastercard logo. Those guys are also extremely idealistic and are often more interested in a perfect theoretical platonic ideal of a blockchain than the real thing.   
They do not care about the price, they do not care about the speed of Cardano. As long as Charles Hoskinson makes videos, they will buy ADA every week and stake all of it forever. And lets face it, Charles will never stop making videos.   
Don't get me wrong, Cardano can become a formidable blockchain for sure, but I also think that ADA will stay in the top 10 even if it literally stops working for years, as long as Charles makes videos about how everything is proceeding according to plan. That's the reason why I have some Cardano in my Portfolio and maybe you should too.",2324,2022-04-10 08:37:45,896
ADA,cryptocurrency,Congrats to ADA holders - $2 has been breached!,"With the market still recovering from Elon Musk’s tweet ADA has held steady and continued to grow reaching a new ATH of $2!

ADA,cryptocurrency,Binance is not holding verifiable proof of reserves for ETH/XRP in the BNB ecosystem and is failing to hold adequate reserves / or show reserves for most of its other cryptos. They only verify that they hold 30% of the ADA in the BNB ecosystem.,"Please also check the edit at the bottom for an update regarding lack of proof of reserves on the stables on BNB as well:

**TLDR:** Binance fails to provide adequate proof of reserves for assets in the BNB chain. Binance encourages users to withdraw their crypto into the Binance ecosystem by charging higher fees to withdraw into native ecosystems - and are failing to Provide Proof of Assets altogether or a sufficient amount in their Proof of Assets for the crypto in the Binance ecosystem. This gives Binance a huge opportunity to manipulate the crypto market by creating ""fake crypto tokens"" in the BNB ecosystem that are not backed by any underlying asset and then selling/using your assets. Furthermore, it pushes volume into BNB chain by encouraging withdraws into the BNB ecosystem that may end up not backed by any assets....

**What you need to know**

* [BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2 tokens) and BNB Smart Chain (BEP20 tokens) are two native chains of the Binance ecosystem](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/854415cf3d214371a7b60cf01ead0918). Binance allows users to withdraw lots of different crypto as tokens into their native chains which then allows users the ability to use ""those assets"" in the Binance ecosystem.
* As you can imagine, this could create a few concerns... The largest being Binance could sell/send the underlying asset of the BEP2/20 Tokens as the user no longer holds the true crypto but a token on the Binance ecosystem, essentially allowing them to manipulate the total supply of those cryptos by creating ""fake BNB tokens"" with no actual backing on the native chain.
* To ease concerns about artificial manipulation Binance began providing [Proof of Asset](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof) wallets where, for crosschain assets (Ether, XRP, ADA, Doge, etc..) they should theoretically hold an underlying asset equal to the amount of the asset that is in the BEP2/20 ecosystem. This is supposed to ensure the Binance asset you are holding is backed by an equal amount on its native chain and the supply is not being artificially manipulated.
   * The problem however is they do not provide a Proof of Asset list for most of their assets in the Binance ecosystem. Additionally of those that have a Proof of Asset wallet, most are not fully backed or actually list no real backing at all.
      * The [LTC proof of reserve address](https://blockchair.com/litecoin/address/MQSs17ECe51kqhkFPQY98wiyPvGuK5iCB6) holds 745K LTC. However there are 857k LTC in the BNB ecosystem - 725k in the [BEP20 addresses](https://bscscan.com/token/0x4338665cbb7b2485a8855a139b75d5e34ab0db94) and 132k in the [BEP2 addresses](https://explorer.bnbchain.org/asset/LTC-F07) \-  **87% backed**
      * THE [ADA proof of reserve](https://explorer.cardano.org/en/address?address=addr1q8hsff3uwtphx7dtya7unjwjwug52e5jvqp09je6pwqx8k4jvuxrw2x5rr7e258a33yzkrhhlrrc5ezvd2z7qtdq0gasme44c9) address holds 200M ADA. However there are 672M ADA in the BNB ecosystem - 241M circulating in [BEP20 addresses](https://bscscan.com/token/0x3ee2200efb3400fabb9aacf31297cbdd1d435d47) and 431M circulating in [BEP2 addresses](https://bscscan.com/token/0x3ee2200efb3400fabb9aacf31297cbdd1d435d47) \- **29.7% backed**
      * (very concerning) The following is the [listed](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof) proof of asset address [for ETHER](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9BF4001d307dFd62B26A2F1307ee0C0307632d59). It's supposed to hold all of the ETHER on the BNB ecosystem but it currently sits at .017 ETH and the ETHER was moved to [this address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf977814e90da44bfa03b6295a0616a897441acec), labeled as Binance 8. The BNB ETHER reserves were comingled with non-BNB reserve ether, meaning you can't verify how much the BNB Ether is backed verse regular user funds. - **0% verifiably backed**
      * (very concerning and easier to understand) The [XRP](https://xrpscan.com/account/rJpj1Mv21gJzsbsVnkp1U4nqchZbmZ9pM5) proof of reserves wallet for the BNB Chain is just as bad as the ETHER but since it doesn't show any tokens **it's easier to see how bad it is**. It holds a total of 10 XRP. The rest was transferred to [this wallet](https://xrpscan.com/account/rs8ZPbYqgecRcDzQpJYAMhSxSi5htsjnza) \- a general Binance wallet for XRP, which interacts with [this wallet](https://xrpscan.com/account/rDAE53VfMvftPB4ogpWGWvzkQxfht6JPxr) \- the withdrawal address for users of XRP. Again all XRP in the BNB reserves have been comingled with regular user funds not in BNB. with no way to verify they hold sufficient XRP in the BNB chain. - **0% verifiably backed**

\-----------------------------------------------------

Binance lists 35 different crypto assets in their [Proof of Assets Page](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof), however in the top 200 cryptos by market cap, over 80 of them can be withdrawn as BEP2/20 tokens. Meaning there are at least 45 cryptos assets that do not have any sort of ""proof of asset"" listed. The total number of unbacked assets is even higher, as there are assets above 200+ by marketcap that can be withdrawn into the Binance ecosystem.

Even for assets that have a proof of reserve listed that doesn't mean it is adequately backed or backed at all. For example; ETH ERC2/20 tokens have no verifiable backing, XRP ERC2/20 tokens have no verifiable backing, ADA ERC2/20 tokens are 29.7% backed. LTC ERC2/20 tokens are 86.9% backed and those are just a few of the listed assets that I checked.

\----------------------------

**Complications**: This problem has been unchecked and inflated since, I posted about this issue [6 months ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uz09wu/binance_is_encouraging_withdrawingminting_your/). Since then XRP and ETHER have lost all verifiable backing and ADA backing dropped from 71% to \~30%.

It continues to be compounded by the fact that Binance encourages users to send their crypto into BEP 2/20 tokens by making it more expensive to send the asset into the native chain. As an example Dogecoin costs 1.94 Doge to withdraw as a BEP 2/20 token and 5 Doge to withdraw into the native Dogecoin network. This is standard practice for [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/fee/cryptoFee)/[BinanceUS](https://www.binance.us/en/fee/schedule) for nearly all assets available to withdrawal into the Binance ecosystem, and the unbacked assets will likely continue to grow if left unchecked.

If the last few weeks haven't made it clear yet, the last people left holding unbacked assets end up with nothing.

# Edit:

As pointed out by [another user](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/yxxugl/comment/iwrfyhd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Binance also no longer has proof of reserves of the **PAXD or the USDC stablecoin** both of which are still circulating in the BNB ecosystem. Both appear to have been comingled with regular user funds in the Binance 8 wallet (link below).

PAXD [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8e870d67f660d95d5be530380d0ec0bd388289e1?a=0x47ac0Fb4F2D84898e4D9E7b4DaB3C24507a6D503)

ADA,cryptocurrency,Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin Says Cardano (ADA) Is Introducing Fresh Ideas to the Crypto Space ((Any chance we could stop with the ETH vs. ADA bull? Go read his quotes. The truth is actually more nuanced)).,,2987,2021-06-12 13:24:53,636
ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano (ADA) has officially made a lower low to prices not seen since January 2021,"Cardano (ADA) has officially made a lower low to prices not seen since January 2021.

Ever since the April/May drop, ADA has failed to achieve much upward movement, even during BTC’s bear market rally to $25k. 

Recently, the price of ADA has reached $0.3750,  which has not happened for the coin since the beginning of the crypto bull market January 2021. 

If CPI data dumps the market, we could see a $0.30 ADA in the near future, as there is not much support below these levels. 

Do I still hodl some? Yes. Not a humongous bag, but enough to find this price movement interesting to say the least. I still believe this coin will survive this bear, and possibly thrive in the next bull. However, as we all know in this space, there are no guarantees.

Looks like theyre really committed to the rapid fire approach.

Im sure theres more that they have this opinion on but “Schroedinger’s securities” i guess we will have to wait and see",563,2023-06-05 16:25:41,998
ADA,cryptocurrency,I don't care how many down votes this gets. Everyone here needs to understand the security risks with ADA's smart contracts are not FUD.,"Tldr: This isn't debatable: ADA will not have defi until they deploy a sidechain or other solution that has not yet been developed, let alone tested. Telling people ""it's okay, don't worry about this FUD"" will directly cause people to lose serious amounts of money. Everyone needs to understand the additional risks they will be taking on if they use centralized ""defi"" on cardano. 


This is not FUD; this is a serious problem. The cardano chain absolutely cannot run a uniswap DEX. That's bad, but the real problem is that everyone, including devs [learning plutus ](https://plutus-pioneer-program.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pioneer/week10.html), are actively being misinformed by cardano's leadership. 


The problem is fundamental to cardano's eUTXO architecture. In plutus, every AMM pool has an NFT that must be referenced to create a tx on the exchange. And, every tx writes over that pool NFT with an updated NFT that reflects the current state of the pool. Every tx must create a new pool NFT, and no txs can call the previous NFT.

In UTXO all txs are deterministic. That means that if you and me both call the existing NFT pool for our tx, only one of our txs will be completed. I can't reference the pool NFT if it doesn't exist anymore, because you beat me to it. My tx will fail, and I will have to call the new NFT that your tx created. 

So, you can code a Uniswap AMM program, and everything will look completely fine as long as one person trades at a time. When 50 people attempt to interact with it (within the amount of time it takes to query the state of the pool, consider accepting the exchange rate, and actually submitting a tx), 49 of their txs will fail, and you will soon have a pile up with thousands of txs failing for every one tx that succeeds. Realistically, the pool will change before most people even attempt to submit the tx, causing it to immediately fail.

That's why it currently is not possible to run a DEX on cardano. DEXs will have to be run on non-eutxo sidechains or use other methods that have not been fully tested yet. This is a PITA, but the real problem is the workaround solutions that are going to be implemented. The ADA community's (and Charles' very intentional) misrepresentation of the issue is going to end disastrously.

https://twitter.com/ErgoDex/status/1434241109283287041?s=20

https://sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/concurrency-state-cardano-c160f8c07575


Sidechain and decentralized solutions to this problem do exist, but none of them have been developed or tested yet. Sundaeswap claims to have a secret solution, but it's really not possible that they have a decentralized solution ready to go. 

There is a HUGE difference between going ""off-chain"" to a decentralized sidechain and going ""off-chain"" through a centralized, trusted custodian (even if they route your tx to another decentralized chain). Charles knows this, and he also knows that you don't. 

This means, that for the time being, cardano will not have decentralized exchanges, and because of the community's refusal to acknowledge and honestly address this conversation, most ADA users will have no understanding of the vulnerabilities these centralized  exchanges represent.

Until this problem is solved, treat every cardano ""DEX"" like a ""CEX."" Do not leave large amounts of money in their SCs. There will be DEXs that pop up and offer great APRs using the same code as well-known projects, but they will exit scam. People will exploit this. Cardano should delay smart contracts until this is resolved. This will make cardano the riskiest chain for defi.

At present time, all 3 coins have dipped approximately **22%**. All this while BTC and Eth have only both dipped a modest **3%** \- so this isn't a market wide panic crash, but more so for the select altcoins.

ADA's current price sits at 24 cents, MATIC 60 cents, SOL $14. Quite shocking prices for coins that are the top 10 cryptos, and I guess goes to show that really nothing is safe apart from BTC and Eth.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Why i am investing on ADA in this bear market.,"I am fully aware that Cardano is one of the most divisive coins in this sub, and that this post will either be buried with dislikes or completely ignored but I think this post can show a different way of investing. Firstly, it is important to say that I only invest in the long term, I believe that the market is much more predictable when predicting a larger time frame.

My investment journey started in stocks in 2019 and my only pick was AMD, I went against trend of investing in ETF's, and thought it would be more efficient and would give more returns to identify a good company than playing safe with the boring SP500, with long-term-potential, luckily amd was one of those companies. 

Then I joined Crypto in 2021 I followed the same approach, which led me to invest most of my money in BTC and ETH, but as much as I think these currencies are excellent investments, I wanted to find my optimal investment, minimizing the risks to invest in altcoins and looking to outperform BTC/ETH i found ADA. This was the factors I looked for:

Leadership

There are no metrics to measure leadership, there are no statistics that say how good a leader is, and in the Crypto world where currencies are supposed to be decentralized there shouldn't even be a leader right?  After all, cryptocurrencies are not private companies managed by an individual or group so it shouldn't apply. But let me make a point, a leader is not an owner or a dictador, a leader is the one who inspires and sets the path, a leader doesn't even have to be popular, fair, or good, but he has to have the ability to influence, a good leader, even if he is not present, can guide us forward and we have no better example of this than Satoshi Nakamoto. 

Lisa Su was the main reason I invested in AMD and Charles Hoskinson is the reason I choose the Cardano network, I know what you're thinking, ""Charles is a charlatan, a prick, scummy..."" I heard this too a million times and I'm the first to admit that Charles is never going to be unanimous, he's always going to be a divisive figure, and the reason is that a lot of what Charles says is controversial, and that's not a bad thing, matters worth talking about will always offend or hurt someone, the truth can be hard and raw, and when the people who you bother the most are people with power, you can be sure you will be an enemy, and this is reflected in the media coverage, public opinion, and even here in this sub. 
This is why i did my due diligence, decided i needed more than a headline or quote to form my opinion of him, and to my astonishment i was amazed at his coherence, eloquence and competence not only technically but in dealing with difficult problems. But my objective here is not to say what you should think of it, but to emphasize the importance of listening and analyzing the leaders of the projects you like, because no project survives without strong leadership, think of Elon Musk, Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, have you seen the hate they carry, how divisive they are? But they still manage to create some of the most successful companies in the world, there is no reason to believe that Crypto is different, business is made of people and crypto is people.

Strategy

how many monopolies have failed due to poor planning? Or due to sudden growths that were not sustainable? Blockbuster, Nokia, Kodak and many other companies were not ready for a world in constant evolution, we have examples of more recent companies that are doing everything in their power to adapt to changes in the market that they failed to foresee, Zoom, Netflix, Gopro for example, grew abruptly during the pandemic only to be pulled back to reality. These are not the kind of companies you want to invest in for the long term, and again crypto is no different. Perhaps BTC does not need to adapt, but we have seen how difficult it has been for ETH to adapt to the chaotic world of cryptocurrencies, (I am not attacking Ethereum) as I even think that Ethereum is one of the few coins with a clear and well defined vision, but this is another point that made me choose Cardano, the Roadmap is clear and adjustable, there are 5 phases taking place simultaneously to create what I believe to be the objective of a layer 1 a decentralized, autonomous and sustainable blockchain. I have not found any project with such solid foundations and prepared to adapt to the market while prioritizing governance and the democratic process, not even Charles himself can decide anything by himself, of course if we look at metrics we see more developed projects, with better numbers, but the security of having solid fundamentals is something non-negotiable in my opinion, this are systems that will interact with entire financial markets, we need guarantees that the blockchain is not only prepared for anything but will not be corrupted or manipulated by people or groups bad intentions. 

X Factor

I know it's weird to talk about an x ​​factor in this context but think with me... why are people obsessed with Apple products? When you imagine an expensive watch, do you remember Rolex? When it comes to photo editing, do you remember Adobe photoshop? Probably yes. We human beings are emotional beings, and not recognizing this is just lack of rationality, if brands or even products can awaken feelings and sensations and this leads people to buy or use, how would this be different in Crypto? Many projects have unique characteristics, but few have the X factor. 
It is undeniable that BTC transmits security in the chaotic world that are alternative investments, the fact that we do not know who created Bitcoin was a great impetus to make BTC the people's currency , a symbol of resistance, the first crypto, the ""grandfather"" and depending on who you ask, a cult. This is the real reason why no coin is going to replace BTC, emotion. ETH has its X-factor, Vitalik and his vision, the first smart-contracts blockchain, it's hard to imagine a future where ETH is not here. This brings me to Cardano, where a strong community has come together with a focus on democracy and decentralization and freedom, even if it means falling behind AKA (turtle ap roach) how much will these foundations and Predictability be worth in the future? Cardano is often called a cult, and in part those who say it are not wrong, but devaluing the importance of community and sentiment is. 

These were the factors I used to invest in the markets and pick winning projects, both in stocks and crypto. I'm not saying to think like me, but to use critical thinking to identify the best investments, we often end up clinging to metrics that tell us little about the future, people control the market, numbers are just a reflection of that.

I know it was a long post, so thanks for reading until the end. Good investments.

The author invests in long-term stocks and cryptocurrencies, and chooses Cardano (ADA) as an investment for the long term. The author believes that strong leadership, clear and adaptable strategy, and an ""X Factor"" are important in choosing investments. The author sees these qualities in Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, and the Cardano network's roadmap. Additionally, the author values the security of solid fundamentals in a cryptocurrency project. The author suggests that the emotional aspect of a cryptocurrency, or its ""X Factor,"" is also important in attracting investors.",403,2023-03-09 15:57:41,557
ADA,cryptocurrency,You know shit is about to get real when VET and ADA start to pump.,"After like 6 months of just crabbing and bleeding a lot. We are finally picking up some pace. And a what a pace that is. Before that always BTC went up and we thought the rally is about to start. But this time we got the real indicators going up. The famous ADA and VET stablecoins are on the rise!

I mean seriously what was the last time we saw ADA making double digit gains nearly everyday and goddamn VET pump 30% in one day. Other Cryptos pump double digits nearly every second week or so. That's nothing special and does not mean anything at all. 

And if we are all lucky we may be going on such a MASSIVE rally that ADA would be capable of regaining its stablecoin status at 1.20$ and VET its stable coin status at 0.11$. Buckle up everyone we are in for a helluva crazy ride.",921,2022-03-27 17:24:45,317

ADA,cryptocurrency,To the people that say that ADA will rise a lot in the long term: Why?,"I noticed that this sub is responding to serious concerns about Cardano by calling it FUD or calling the poster out for allegedly being only into short term gains or buying the peak.

People are also blaming the bear market that started in November and the war that started recently as the sole reason for the dip, even though the ADA price has been falling non-stop since September.

So far, I have not met a single person here that made an actual argument for ADAs long term value.

I would like to know what’s so special about it? I get that ETH is currently unbearable and its true that Cardano has Proof-of-Stake while ETH doesn't. But there are literally dozens of Proof-of-stake blockchains with working smart contracts and a blooming network of dApps.

Tezos, Harmony, Fantom, Juno, Algorand, Solana, BSC, Tron, Flow, Cronos, Secret Network, Oasis, Near, Klaytn, Celo, Avalanche, Moonbeam and many more are proof of stake and have tons of dApps. They all have their pros and cons, but every single one of them is much further in their development than Cardano. Some of them also seem more scalable for the long term like Harmony and Near.

So, what about Cardano is so promising? Why is everyone so sure that it will outperform all this other ETH competitors?

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano now has almost 574 million ada in its treasury or almost 1.5 billion USD to fund YOUR projects and ADA HODLers having been voting on them throughout 2021! This is how self-sustainable ecosystem with governance looks like!," Exactly   a year now ADA HODLers have been staking and delegating their ADA to   stake pool operators = validators and getting their rewards every epoch   (= 5days)  and on average yearly delegation rewards of around 5%.   Meaning that if you started with 100k ada you'll end up with around 105k   after one year... Note that the rewards from one epoch are added to  the  next and the next rewards are calculated based on that, pretty  sweet!

Cool  thing about staking  with ADA is that your ADA is never locked and you  can move it at any  time, which is not the case for ETH2 and  others...Also, pretty cool!

About 70% of the total CIRCULATING supply is staked, see [https://adapools.org/press](https://adapools.org/press) and you can imagine what that means for the price once the smart contracts drop on mainnet on 9/12!

Here's the excel file with the treasury info. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xny1W7HhHANLNeQcnbr8El5rakJ80VIM7fgDwJ-uqys/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xny1W7HhHANLNeQcnbr8El5rakJ80VIM7fgDwJ-uqys/edit#gid=0)

ADA,cryptocurrency,Binance is blocking ADA withdrawals towards the end of each 5-day 'epoch' (staking reward cycle),"I haven't experienced this myself, but people are talking about having ADA withdrawals blocked towards the end of the epoch. Binance is motivated to do this because a 'snapshot' of staking wallet balances is taken at the end of the epoch, and staking rewards are calculated based on that. This is highly unethical however , because it means Binance is staking other people's ADA, collecting those staking rewards, and making the ADA unavailable to the owners when it suits them. Supposedly the hold on withdrawals can be as long as a full day before the end of the epoch, but typically happens at least an hour before the end of the epoch.

ADA,cryptocurrency,I don’t understand the hate for ADA and Charles.,"*****Obvious disclaimer, among others, I have a big bag of ADA.*****

Most people’s dislike of ADA seems to come from Charles. I’m going to put aside another big point people bring up, the fact that Haskell is inherently harder to code in than other languages and only focus on the Charles aspect - maybe Haskell can be another post. 

I cannot deny that Charles is a very outspoken man and has MANY times contradicts himself on things such as ignoring the haters or not feeding the trolls. I’ll waive the white flag on the point all day. 

The problem is that most people seem to gloss over the fact that Charles cares immensely about crypto as a technology and wants nothing but the best for it. In fact, a lot of the things he says - and then gets absolutely ripped to shreds for in this sub - are valid, real problems of other technologies. FUD is not the same as criticism and people immediately label anything that puts a “bad light” on their coin as FUD. If people can’t understand that constructive criticism, or even blatantly stating problems with other cryptos is for the greater good of the entire community, then that’s just going to delay adoption even further and prevent all of us from getting a Lambo sooner. 

I’d also like to remind everyone of how Charles went and spoke in front of the government on behalf of the entire cryptocurrency community/technology and he was highly regarded across not only internet, but also this sub for his speech. Everyone couldn’t have been happier with what he said and that he did  it for the betterment of the entire crypto space. I’m sorry people, but you can’t have it both ways. 

He cares about the tech, has a vision, and is striving for success. Does he run his mouth too much sometimes? Yes. But to me, this doesn’t warrant the hate he and ADA get.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano (ADA) Staking Has Reached More Than 650k Addresses,,797,2021-06-26 10:34:48,280
ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano - Step by step guide to staking ADA,"Cardano, and its native coin ADA, is one of the most solid blockchain platform projects currently. The team has shown repeatedly that they can deliver on their promises and the project is famous for being backed by peer-reviewed research. Exciting news are coming for this project so be sure to check their website [https://cardano.org](https://cardano.org) and their roadmap [https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/).

This post will be a step-by-step guide to staking your ADA. There are various ways to proceed but we will be using the **Yoroi chrome extension**. Additionally, although not required, it is **highly recommended to use a hardware wallet**. Any of the following will do:

* Ledger Nano S
* Ledger Nano X
* Trezor model T

This guide will cover the following:

1. Set up the Yoroi google chrome extension
2. Connect or create your ADA wallet
3. Send ADA to your wallet
4. Choose a stake pool and delegate your ADA
5. Staking rewards

# 1) Set up the Yoroi google chrome extension

First of all, we need to install the Yoroi Chrome extension. Navigate to the official wallet page [https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/) and download the extension.

&#x200B;

[Download the Yoroi Google Chrome extension](https://preview.redd.it/qg5evijpl9w61.png?width=1267&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c7f1f64edf61e9aab53ccffc52422579f4c1b5)

Once dowloaded, you will need to click 'Add to Chrome' and 'Add extension' to enable the extension in Chrome.

It will then appear in the top-right corner of your Chrome browser (click the little puzzle piece icon) and you may want to pin it to keep it visible.

&#x200B;

[Shortcut to the Yoroi extension](https://preview.redd.it/8ecdgxntl9w61.png?width=326&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b77ff98d2e77b7999d034346da8ef4deb134b03)

Now you can launch the Yoroi extension and, as this is the first time, we will need to go through a few setup steps:

* Choose language
* Agree to the terms and conditions
* Choose 'Simple' level of complexity
* Skip 'Cardano payments URL' and confirm (you can always set it up later if needed)

That's it, the extension is ready to use and your home page should now look like this.

&#x200B;

[Yoroi wallet home screen](https://preview.redd.it/rsutop7vl9w61.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=66e90e3c773afef5225494bd1c808165ff5617ca)

# 2) Connect or create your ADA wallet

The safest option at this point is to use a hardware wallet. If you do not have one yet, you can always create a local wallet to start with (and and transfer your coins to your hardware wallet when you do buy one).

# 2.a) Connect to a hardware wallet

I will use the Trezor model T to illustrate but the Ledger Nano works similarly

* One the home screen menu, select 'connect to a hardware wallet',
* Select 'Cardano'
* Select your hardware wallet type: either Ledger or Trezor
* Choose Shelley-era wallet, as we want to be able to stake
* Your hardware wallet needs to have already been initialised, press 'Next'

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2gn4kmrwl9w61.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c79fe239e5b7691504cb808998406fdf900b070

* Now, make sure your hardware wallet is connected to the computer and unlocked, press 'Connect'

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fqtxyesxl9w61.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=3021abf0a96c419a95c29bdcd2575a2f7d477f96

* A new page pops up to ask you to transfer your public key to the wallet. This is expected as the public key allows you to receive money to your wallet. Note that the private keys never leave your hardware wallet. Now click, 'Export'

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a7bg4hvyl9w61.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=af7e7cd73343e4e803797abd151a2f85d74f6423

* Then, the wallet name, retrieved from your hardware wallet, will appear. Click 'Save' to complete this step and reach the Yoroi dashboard.

# 2.b) Create a local wallet

This section is only if you do not own a hardware wallet and want to use a software wallet instead. If you own a hardware wallet and have completed step 2.a, you can skip this section and proceed to step 3.

* On the home screen menu, select 'create wallet',
* Select 'Cardano'
* Choose 'Create wallet'
* Enter a wallet name and a strong password, then 'Create personal wallet'

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lk699320m9w61.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=58fd77bf09890ddc655590c92ec9f1cf840b4626

* The next step will give you your 15 words seed phrase. Make sure to write it down (on paper, no electronic support) and to keep (several copies) safe and labelled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3cwl5x21m9w61.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&s=091cc3fb943d0775033ca00fd20ef9388660b67f

* Once you have written it down, you will be asked to enter it to check you have it correctly.
* Now you can confirm, your wallet is created and you are taken to the Yoroi dashboard.

# 3) Send ADA to your wallet

Welcome to your Yoroi dashboard.

&#x200B;

[Yoroi dashboard](https://preview.redd.it/szzqx7d2m9w61.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd301b23c37296518447beeee0df735e33d55833)

In order to transfer ADA to your wallet, simply go to the 'Receive' tab in order to copy your address. You can then use this address to transfer the ADA you will have bought in your favourite exchange. Note that ADA transaction fees are rather low at roughly 0.17 ADA.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zgghlhj3m9w61.png?width=1238&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f71d4a58885bcbbb9c0c8008d0635a84baf13ee

# 4) Choose a stake pool and delegate your ADA

From your dashboard, we now move on to the 'Delegation' tab.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fthbb2r6m9w61.png?width=1231&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d326a09dd1e5653bf5dfe98f9e4a9656ea6d21e

Here, we need to choose a staking pool from the list. If you do not know yet which pool to use, the best thing to do is to navigate to [https://pooltool.io/](https://pooltool.io/) in order to find a staking pool that you like, more on that later.

Once you have chosen a pool from the list, simply click 'Delegate' and confirm. You will also have to confirm the delegation with your Trezor/Ledger if you are using a hardware wallet. That's it, you're all set and you should see the total ADA delegated onto your dashboard. A few things to note:

* you can only delegate to a single pool
* but you can cancel the delegation or switch pool at any time, there is no lock-up period
* there is a 2 ADA staking fee registration that you need to pay the first time you start staking, so you do not need to pay it again in the future if you switch pool or add ADA to your wallet
* any ADA sent to your wallet will automatically be staked in the pool you have chosen
* similarly, the rewards are automatically added to your wallet and thus the interest is compounded.

Now the remaining question is how to choose a stake pool. The first thing to keep in mind is that there is no risk associated with staking ADA and the worst that can happen is that you do not receive any reward. First of all, we need to consider the following

* **Epoch**: the staking rewards are computed for each epoch, which lasts 5 days.
* **Fees**: each pool will charge a fixed fee (typically 340 ADA per epoch) and a variable fee (aka pool margin). The fees will not be taken from your wallet and you can only earn ADA by staking. The fees are charged to the total amount earned by the stake pool during the epoch and then, the remaining is distributed among the participants of the pool proportionally to their contribution to the stake pool. In the example below, there will be 9,000 ADA left to be distributed to the members of the pool:

&#x200B;

|Total pool reward (example)|10,340 ADA|
|:-|:-|
|Fixed fee (340 ADA)|\-340 ADA|
|Left after fixed fee|10,000 ADA|
|Variable fee (e.g. 10%)|\-1,000 ADA|
|Left after all fees|**9,000 ADA**|

&#x200B;

* **Saturation**: in order to discourage centralisation, the concept of saturation decreases the amount of reward to too large pools. Currently, the saturation level is 64M ADA. This means that you should not stake your ADA to pools where the staked amount is more than 64M ADA.

Now, let's go to [https://pooltool.io/](https://pooltool.io/) to select our pool.

&#x200B;

[A few stake pools on pooltool.io](https://preview.redd.it/wnv8xzahm9w61.png?width=1285&format=png&auto=webp&s=14ad9703b6d6f0bcc42ef5967b236ac97e91d8b6)

The important fields are the following:

* **Pool ID:** you can copy this address to paste in your Yoroi delegation tool once you have selected the right pool
* **Epoch Fee:** these are the fixed fees and should be 340
* **Variable Fee:** you want to avoid too large fees but it is also worth paying a bit more to join a pool that you trust. Be aware that some pools are effectively closed and thus charge a 100% fee. Note also that some pool will have a very low, even zero, fee to help them grow but it might be increased in the future.
* **Declared pledge:** the amount pledged by the pool operator at the time of creation of the pool, not massively important for the pool selection.
* **Epoch ROS:** the expected annualised return in the current epoch, this will typically be around 5%.
* **Live stake:** the total amount staked in the pool, it is important that this remains under the saturation threshold of 64M.
* **Lifetime ROS:** the historical return of the pool, this shows you past performance of the pool.

There is also an official calculator to compute your expected rewards depending on the various parameters: [https://cardano.org/calculator/?calculator=delegator](https://cardano.org/calculator/?calculator=delegator) .

# 5) Staking rewards

The staking rewards are paid with a three epochs delay. This means that you do not receive any reward for the first 15-20 days but you keep receiving rewards for 15-20 days if you cancel your delegation.

The rewards are paid at the end of every epoch (for the amount you delegated three epochs prior), hence every 5 days. The typical APY will be around 5% but the rewards are spread over 365/5 = 73 payments. Consequently, the average rewards per epoch is approximately

&#x200B;

[Average reward per epoch](https://preview.redd.it/1v9htknkm9w61.png?width=204&format=png&auto=webp&s=be842927c1319a7cca337d7908ac1a986c300ebd)

For example, this is **approximately 0.68 ADA per epoch per 1,000 ADA delegated**.

&#x200B;

[Average reward per epoch for 1,000 staked ADA](https://preview.redd.it/73y0pu5mm9w61.png?width=214&format=png&auto=webp&s=42a245321926fc974676355c7b984f5bef041667)

I hope you will find this guide helpful.

# Edit

Adding a small edit to discuss a common question in the comments: many people are asking how this compares with staking directly on Binance. The decision is up to you, I will simply list a few pros and cons.

Pros of staking on Binance:

* Binance allows you to stake directly on the exchange which is certainly easier to set up than the above. 
* Moreover, Binance claims to be able to provide a better return than the 5% you get when staking through Yoroi.

Cons of staking on Binance:

* ""Not your keys, not your coins"": the coins are held by Binance rather than safely in your hardware wallet. Therefore, you are at risk of losing them: Binance servers could go down, be hacked, ...
* Staking in smaller pools helps with the decentralisation of the network. Staking in the large Binance pools is against the spirit of the project.

ADA,cryptocurrency,A sovereign wealth fund of 1.5B ADA (~$500M) unlocks later today to be used by and for every single member in the Cardano ecosystem. The most consequential upgrade (Chang hard fork) brings the most advanced governance system in the history of the cryptocurrency industry.,"1. **Decentralization** and the concept of **sound money** has always been a **bedrock of the cryptocurrency space**. Another bedrock is the idea of **being governed by the many for the many, instead of the few**. With **blockchains** we **don’t have leaders**; instead, we all **come together as a community and decide on doing things**.
2. A step towards realizing **Satoshi's vision of decentralized systems** potentially running economic, political and social systems globally.
3. Positions **Cardano to become an open platform that seeks to provide economic identity to the billions** who lack it by **providing decentralized applications to manage identity, value and governance**.
4. Chang is the **most consequential upgrade** because it **unlocks the most advanced on-chain governance system in the history of the cryptocurrency industry**. It introduces the concept of **liquid democracy**.
5. The Chang (named as a tribute to Phil Chang & his significant contributions to Cardano's governance strategies) hard fork brings **the age of ""Voltaire""** to Cardano & it will take place **today at 21:44 UTC**
6. After Chang, **community takes over** and that is the reality and nature of a structure that is here to stay because it can survive the loss of its founders, bad roadmaps & the founders being wrong.
7. This approach emphasizes the **long-term thinking** vs. short term price fluctuations -> **built to look at the world in terms of decades and centuries**, a stark contrast to the ‘move fast and break things’ blockchain industry around us.
8. it unlocks **a sovereign wealth fund of 1.5bn ada valued at almost $500m today**. This is a truly extraordinary thing **to be used by and for every single one of the millions of members in the Cardano ecosystem** who don’t know each other, have never even met each other, are now going to work together through a blockchain and make decisions.
9. The **purpose of Voltaire is to harness, aggregate, and refine that collective will into one clear voice – despite decentralization –** about where to go and how to get there. The reality is that **no one is smarter than everyone.**

Bonus (for the haters): yep that means that **Charles becomes just another community member** as genesis keys (of IOG, Cardano foundation and Emurgo) will be burnt.

ADA,cryptocurrency,"Comparison: ETH, ADA, DOT, ATOM","Alright so I'm starting this post off because there is a lot of misinformation in our community and lack of understanding of what each one of these (and many other) crypto's are attempting to do and solve with their blockchain technology.

and not enough 

*  ""Polkadot could be a good thing for Ethereum, might as well load up on both.""


I will not be providing any advice on what to buy, sell, or hodl in this post but rather exposing the differences between these TYPES of projects and why they do not compete with one another or how they do. These explanations are not super in-depth but I know that many aren't taking the time to actually read the documentation from these projects and hopefully some of this will help give our community a better understanding.

#  Smart Contract Blockchain Platform

## Ethereum (ETH):
Ethereum was the first of it's kind, at least, the first to successfully make a large blockchain platform that successfully deploys and runs smart contracts while also handling millions of transactions a day. (Running a smart contract is also considered a transaction.  As of today, Ethereum has managed to put out 1.303 million transactions and there are over 3000 decentralized applications (dApps, https://www.stateofthedapps.com/platforms/ethereum)


With those transactions in mind, Ethereum has an issue on its hands and you can guess it. Gas. Gas is the method for which the entire blockchain runs. Imagine your car, you need gas to crank it and drive it. Same thing you need gas to send transactions. Why is this? This is due to to the Proof of Work protocol that allows for these transactions to be done. I won't go into the nitty gritty. But basically, you're paying the miners to process your transaction.

## Cardano (ADA):
Cardano is developing a smart contract platform on their blockchain technology. Supposedly it will be more feature-rich than Ethereum. However, the biggest difference between Cardano and Ethereum is that Cardano utilizes a newer concept known as Proof of Stake. Proof of stake basically has members who hold a specific token the ability to stake their tokens into a stake pool so that the representing server of that pool may process transactions and earn rewards. Those rewards are then dispersed to the members staking their funds. (Expecting personal attacks for mentioning this name, but this is how the Tron (TRX) network runs).

Literally not much else to be said at this point, until Cardano releases Smart Contracts and their documentation and mission proves friendly enough for developers. We can't speculate whether it's a better platform than Ethereum. 

With ETH 2.0 expecting to come out next year, there will not be much difference between these two except for how their governance works and how their Proof-of-Stake works. With this in mind, what matters is the community between these two and which platform provides better documentation for the community and big organizations to be able to developer their own decentralized applications on.



# Internet of Blockchains

## Polkadot (DOT)

Polkadot's main goal is to utilize a relay chain to coordinate the system and the Parachains. Parachains are the platforms which will be built by other development teams to create their own blockchains ON the DOT platform. For example, if Ethereum were in the development stages of OG Ethereum, then they may have considered developing Ethereum on DOT  so that some features were already handled (such as security and communications between other blockchains.) 

You can not run a Smart Contract on DOT's network. The relay chain was deliberately minimized in functionality so that it could focus on the main components of DOT. However, there are Ethereum competitors known as Ink!, Moonbeam, and Edgeware that will be coming out on the DOT platform as Smart Contract Parachains (blockchains.)

Validators are basically servers producing blocks on the Relay chain and they receive staking rewards for producing them.

Collators are nodes on both a Parachain and a relay chain, they collect transactions and produce state transition proofs for the validators to accept. Also are the method of communication between blockchains through XCMP (cross-chain message passing)


##  Cosmos (ATOM)

Cosmos main focus is Internet of Blockchains but is a tad different in how they want to interact with these blockchains compared to DOT. Seems more like ATOM wants to compete with Smart Contracts by allowing Application-Specific Blockchains. It looks like they are trying to attempt this by allowing developers to develop a blockchain that is customized to operate a single dApp. I don't fully understand how they plan to do this. I'll come back and edit this section in the morning.


The main goal of Cosmos however is still to allow developers to create blockchains on top of Tendermint (cosmos default consensus engine) so that they can interoperate with one another. The main difference between DOT and ATOM is that DOT will be more specific about how you can create your blockchain in order for it to operate on the DOT network. ATOM has more freedom for the developer.


I'm always welcome to criticism. 


Edit:


Some people misinterpreted my poorly worded mention of TRX to mean that the network of ADA through PoS would cause more network attacks. I really meant that I expected the sub to blast me for mentioning Trons name

Edit 2:

ADA,cryptocurrency,Another green day for the market saw ADA reach monthly high!,"Is it alt season already? Following the news of Apes (bored ones) working with GME, market saw a rally around metaverse projects. Apecoin itself saw more than 15% rise in price (currently rank 86). Several other metaverse projects (like Axis infinity and its SLP, enjin, star Atlas) saw some nice gains too. it is very hard to say if it is just a phase or gonna have long lasting effect on the whole trend tho.















Altcoins also saw some long overdue rises. Carano saw almost 17% to the monthly high of 1.15$ which is by no mean near ATH of 3.09$ but still a source of joy for long time hodlers struggling with sluggish price action for several months now.
Other big gainers include: Dogecoin (14.6%) and Near(10.2%). 












Most alts are green today and most stablecoins are red. Just how we like it! (Unless you missed the last dip like me which is very very sad).
Market doesn't seem whiling to give up 2 trillion floor too. Which is a nice change of scenery to be honest.

* At 17, she met Charles Babbage (""the father of the computer""), and worked with him on developing the Analytical Engine. The algorithm they developed for this machine has been recognized as the first computer algorithm ever made. The Analytical Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit and control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops and integrated memory. The machine is considered Turing Complete

ADA,cryptocurrency,Our beloved Cardano (ADA) Successfully Launches Testnet That Will Bring Ethereum Tokens to Its Ecosystem,"**Cardano (ADA)** developer Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) is announcing the successful launch of a test network (testnet) to allow **Ethereum-based** tokens to migrate to the **Cardano blockchain**.

IOHK [says](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/12/07/the-agix-erc20-converter-testnet-is-now-live/) that it is initially partnering with decentralized artificial intelligence network [SingularityNET](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/singularitynet/) (AGIX) in the initiative.

*This marks a significant step forward in driving interoperability between blockchains to establish a functional environment for decentralized finance (DeFi).”*

The testnet is a working prototype and paves the way for the mainnet, which is the ready product. The mainnet converter will be launched “soon after” the testnet, per SingularityNET CEO and chief scientist Dr. Ben Goertzel.

According to IOHK, the testnet converter transforms Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens into native tokens on the Cardano blockchain. An ERC-20 token is a standard used to create and issue smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

The Cardano developer also says that the sixth-largest blockchain by market cap is also working on connecting to other decentralized protocols.

If someone claims to know otherwise they are lying.  No one here or on the planet can provide you with a definitive response. People only predict what will happen, and the prediction itself is usually biased and based on a foundation of personal interest/emotion.  

Please be patient and observe statistical data over the coming hours/days and make your own conclusions based on this statistical analysis. 

However, that being said, ADA has already made some groundbreaking price movements in the last few weeks, and in comparison, nothing special can be noted in the last 72hrs, of trading, in the runup to smart contracts, so my personal prediction is that there will be no significant rise in price straightaway. 

In addition to this, you may need to worry about the people, who bought in a few weeks ago, that will look to dump the moment the headlines read ""Cardano now smart contract proficient"".

In fact this means ETH has wiped all out gains against BTC since April 2021 when ETH was \~2k and BTC was around \~$60k. Since then ETH has completed the merge moving it from POW to POS and Proto-Danksharding (which dropped the gas cost on L2s). Still in comparing it's value against BTC, ETH has officially lost all of it's bear market gains.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano DeFi is having a bull run within a bull run! ADA will be unstoppable in the coming bull run!,"Let's go back to '21, no smart contracts, no DeFi, no DEXes... ADA at 3$.

The smart contracts era came to Cardano in September '21.

Fast forward now, in just 2 years the Cardano DeFi is booming and it's been booming throughout the bear market times as it can be seen on this [defillama chart](https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano?currency=ADA).  No other major blockchain (ETH, SOL) witnessed a TVL growth in the native currency during the bear market like Cardano did.

https://preview.redd.it/qu2ovp3p045c1.png?width=1613&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a1218b9d507fddb2ddae3c61fe457aeff418adc

For the first time ever, Cardano just entered the top 10 chains by TVL in $ as it can be seen on this [defillama chart.](https://defillama.com/chains)

https://preview.redd.it/c8cic3u3345c1.png?width=1607&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b941f18172700e87ddbea529ac60e25fdc8b39e

Note that Cardano has no USDC or USDT options like other chains so to be in the top 10 is an incredible achievement. It has 2 stablecoin options which are still limited though: DJED (overcollateralized algorithmic stablecoin) and iUSD (synthetic $ asset). Most tokens on Cardano DEXes are still priced vs. ADA.

Cardano had its own memecoin mania called $SNEK back in May '23 during the deep winter of the bear, look at the volume then. The mania with Cardano native tokens started again in December and the daily volume on DEXes is exploding as it can be seen via [taptools.io](https://taptools.io) data.

https://preview.redd.it/wtsbxr3p145c1.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a38acbae14cbde6ea89578e261812b54178ff9d

Besides the memecoin $SNEK , the gaming tokens on Cardano will be the next big thing during the next cycle like DEADPXLZ's $DING and some others like $CLAY, $COPI...

$LENFI, $LQ, $INDY are lending and borrowing protocols +- similar to AAVE or Compound...

The top 50 tokens are really diverse and can be seen on [taptools.io](https://taptools.io) site.

https://preview.redd.it/v7us0h9o145c1.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=0755bf292484a7abd99d54fc40dc2f9fb6c015f7

This time Cardano has a thriving ecosystem with multiple lending/borrowing protocols, synthetics, stablecoin options, DEXes and aggregators, great NFTs and gaming projects. The new teams and new projects are popping up like crazy and people are just coming up with new crazy ideas to harness the magic of Cardano's unique eUTXO model bringing the enterprise grade trading experience (check out [axo.trade](https://axo.trade) for example) like you're on a CEX. Also, options, indexes, baskets, perpetuals, you name it, it's there or in the pipeline for coming months!

So, if you're wondering why ADA price is going up, it's because, this time for the first time Cardano is actually totally ready for the bulls and it will probably be one of, if not, THE best performing major crypto asset this coming bull run!

ADA,cryptocurrency,Charles Hoskinson of Cardano (ADA) calls for togetherness in crypto community,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson held a [session on YouTube yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jex6wItSvzE) to answer pressing questions from the community.

&#x200B;

**Gap due to tribalism**

During the livestream, Hoskinson gave a wish list of what he would like for Christmas; he did not ask for physical gifts this time. Instead, Hoskinson decided to name a pressing problem in the crypto space and that is the growing gap between investors of different projects due to tribalism.

&#x200B;

**Lots of similarities, but still lots of hate**

Hoskinson is done with the hate and actually wants everyone within crypto to get along better.

&#x200B;

'All I want for Christmas is for everyone to get along in our industry. It's extraordinary to me that when people are so close in philosophy and views, and in some cases technology, they can be so far apart as individuals. It's extraordinary.

&#x200B;

**Crypto is different**

Hoskinson finds it strange that investors in crypto are so different and so more emotional than in other industries. There is much less hate in other places.

&#x200B;

'You don't see this in other industries,' Hoskinson said. 'You don't see this in physics, or biology, or cell phone manufacturing, or whatever, pick an industry, the amount of tribalism, hatred and vitriol that our industry has for each other.'

&#x200B;

He went on to explain that as long as people continue to hate each other, there will be no way to fight the real enemy: the legacy systems. He said that this system holds three billion people and will continue to do so. The founder also acknowledged that this will not be easy because there will always be people trying to divide others in space.

&#x200B;

**More collaboration in 2022**

He also sees that there are books and podcasts that say things to divide people. Especially on social media, he sees the community being divided.

&#x200B;

'That has to stop and the only way it will stop is if we get better systems that are fairer. The only way we can do that is by working together. We'll see if that's achieved in 2022.'",290,2021-12-09 20:28:23,270

I believe holding it should be fine, since the ADA project is still a solid project overall and with time we can regain value after they fix any mistakes that might happen.

To start this discussion, my main dislike of ADA, is the confrontation with other coins such as ETH or XRP. The unnecessary amount of trash-talk between coins wont help anybody, and it wont help any one of us to get out of the shithole the market currently is.

\-Now he had a talk with the Chief of Technology (CTO) of Ripple. Maybe they plan to collaborate and that's why he talked with the CTO of Ripple afterwards? 

\-Trump plans to remove capital gains tax from US cryptocurrencies (this would include XRP and ADA)

\- There is a rumor Brad Garlinghouse met with Trump 

There are many common grounds and goals and a very promising environment. The market is reacting and the price of those coins are moving despite there is not an official partnership announcement.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Support for ADA has Been Quietly Growing in This sub,"For the newer members who never experienced it, mentioning ADA in this sub before the Alonzo hard fork (what allowed for defi and smart contracts) was an invitation to polarizing debates in the comments section with both sides ultimately getting bombarded by downvotes. This was especially true if you commented something positive about ada to a post about ETH or other coins. 

It’s no secret that ADA has been hard snd slow to develop, and that Charles is….Charles. However, lately I’ve noticed that ada isn’t getting as much hate from those who aren’t invested into it as it used to, nor is it as much of a downvote war. Sure, there are still some people who want nothing to do with ADA, and that’s perfectly fine. There’s also people who openly criticize it for some of the flaws it has - but this is also great and helps build a better ecosystem!

Overall people may be starting to actually see it as less of a joke or a cult or a “ghost chain” and it’s allowing more ADA supports to feel comfortable about posting in this sub. I especially noticed a turning point when cardano had the random bug that caused a 60% outage, but immediately started rebooting and coming back online all by itself - a very good display of the network doing what it should. We’ve still got a long way to go, but it’s been awesome to see this support grow and the hate or tension between different coin holders becomes less and less.

*Edit - Very sad to see the downvotes rolling in on this post. I really thought this was something the sub had moved away from. If you don’t like ADA that’s okay, but why go out of your way to try and crush positivity*",72,2023-04-02 12:53:22,240
ADA,cryptocurrency,ADA shills saying “cARdAno iS 100% dECenTrALisEd” are being dishonest and misleading.,"I want to preface this by saying I am heavily invested in ADA and love Cardano’s ethos and mission. But I also appreciate honesty and don’t like misleading hype news. If you believe in the fundamentals, lies and hype are not required. 

Everyone but newbies know De-centralized nodes is not enough for network de-centralization. Full decentralization happens once governance is implemented. Stop changing the definition to fit your narrative. 

The majority of development is done by a single team (IOHK/IOG) who have full governance control and are on Charles Hoskinson’s payroll. Most crypto projects launch with D=0 from day one (ie. Bitcoin). So achieving D=0 isn’t a cause for celebration, it’s a concern that it was launched in a fully centralised way in the first place, and I’m glad it’s solved now. 

Bottom line is, those who own ADA validate the network transactions and control the votes. Who owns the ADA supply? Can anyone provide a good analysis showing that the supply is well distributed among a large number of individuals, and not massively controlled by a small group of people?

Edit : I find it hilarious that the biggest argument against this post in the comments is “FUD” or “ETH maxi circlejerk”. How about actually engaging with the arguments I have put forward in the post and perhaps have some constructive conversation? Point me to sources that would say I’m wrong? The name-calling just weakens your stance and makes you look insecure.

ADA,cryptocurrency,"The ugly parts of using Cardano: UTXO limitations, minADA, locked ADA, and collateral","**Disclosure:** Am disappointed long-term ADA user (and small bagholder)

There are a lot of good things about Cardano like high decentralization and deterministic fees (mostly deterministic, since [Phase 2 Tx validation can still fail](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/collateral-mechanism/)). Ultimately, adoption requires good user experience, and I don't think Cardano will ever get there. There are many ugly user experiences to using Cardano that all stem from its use of UTXOs instead of global accounts.

Swaps still require off-chain operators due to concurrency issues, but I think end users have mostly gotten used to them. There are bigger UX annoyances.

**Minimum 1-1.5 ADA per transaction UTXO**

If you've used Cardano, you've probably noticed that tokens lock 1 to 1.5 ADA with them, and wallets usually have 5+ ADA locked up as collateral before you can perform any DeFi transaction (due to the risk of Phase 2 validation failure). dApps can't update token, NFT, and SFT balances without sending the token along a minimum of 1-1.5 ADA in a UTXO. Each Cardano UTXO has a [minimum amount of 1 ADA](https://forum.cardano.org/t/minimum-ada-per-transaction/55109/2). For NFTs and tokens, wallets usually usually lock [1.5 ADA](https://forum.cardano.org/t/nft-minimum-utxo/51839/7) with each token UTXO since there are other factors that affect the minimum amount like utxoCostPerWord.

Imagine if 1 ADA rises to $10 in the future, raising the minimum UTXO amount. Cardano would be unusable. It's not super easy for it to reduce this minimum because the purpose of Min-ada-value is to prevent UTXO bloat. (Edit: I originally wrote spam, but UTXO bloat in memory storage is more accurate).

**No global accounts and simple balance updates**

In addition, accounts aren't global, so there's no good way of tracking user progress. This is better for privacy, but not good if you're trying to build a decentralized identity. Each Cardano wallet is just a collection of UTXOs and lacks a unified account. The staking address is useful, but it's not completely unified. There are 4 different types of Cardano addresses (base, pointer, enterprise, reward account). Not every address can have a pointer to a staking address or uses the same staking address. This severely limits POAPs, airdrops, gaming, and DeFi swaps. Airdrops and POAPs usually check an account's DeFi progress, but without accounts, how can the airdrop owners figure out the activity of those users? Tracking is also inefficient since you can't simply query a single account or contract to get the balance. Instead, you have to rely on a full node + indexer that adds up the balances from every separate UTXO for that user, assuming that indexer can even identify them.

**Are these issues fixable? Or will Cardano user experience continue to be limited due to using UTXOs?**",8,2024-06-21 17:47:15,90

ADA,cryptocurrency,"My thoughts after studying ADA, DOT, ETH","I'll keep this basic but I'll be happy to answer any questions in the comments.

So I'm relatively new, I bought in at the peaks of 2021 for profits, I'd didn't know anything.

After losing all my money I wanted to understand where I was throwing my money to help give my best shot in 2024-2025 so I read about the top project and I'm making this post because I feel like these 3 surprised me the most. 

So let's start with ETH. ETH is the seemingly leader in creating the whole Web3 situation, nothing else comes close in TVL, dev staying power, dapps, and profit via fees. You wanna dex? You wanna bridge? You wanna stable coin? You wanna NFT? ETH has all of that and more

So what about DOT? Well it has a different governance system, arguably better. Different shards than ETH perhaps better. It's built on a chain that makes interoperability much easier than ETH. Ok so why isn't DOT #1? That's because 1st mover benefit, name recognition, and tokenomics. On the shards you don't have to pay with DOT tokens so that doesn't increase price. And your DOT can be locked for up to 2 years if you choose to lend to particular shards (parachains) during auction. Oh and last I checked 10% inflation compared to ETHs Deflation.

And ADA? First I'm going to simply say there's been a lot of drama in the ecosystem, too much to cover here but I don't love that. I found that ADA isn't different enough from ETH for me to feel it offers anything special. At least DOT had interesting governance, auctions, interoperability and sharding. ADA is different than ETH, it's a bit more secure in language, staking pools are also nodes, and it's one of the most decentralized cryptocurrencies there is. But it also has a decent inflation rate low price demand and no real stable coins to help demand in tokenomics.


So TLDR? I found that at least for me, I'd rather buy eth and layer2 protocols than DOT or ADA and I was disappointed that they were so similar to eth and poor supply and demand.


Also ps this isn't perfect, I'm not especially intelligent, this is just my take away.",26,2023-04-06 11:15:59,257
ADA,cryptocurrency,PSA: Cardano (ADA) runs at SEVEN (7) transactions per second. Full sources and calculations in comments.,"There are 3 things that determine transaction speed: block size, block time and transaction size. Let's look at all 3 for Cardano.

1. Block size. The maximum size of a block is 65536bytes.

Here is the source: [https://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-initial-updatable-parameter-values/42261/3](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-initial-updatable-parameter-values/42261/3)

If you scroll down you see the variable ""maxBlockBodySize 65536"" and it is helpfully explained ""Maximum size of a block body. Limits blockchain storage size, and communication costs.""

2. Block time. This is 20 seconds on average. Can't find a great source for this as the block time jumps around a lot on the explorers but Google give you loads of sources e.g. [https://uk.advfn.com/crypto/Cardano-ADA/fundamentals](https://uk.advfn.com/crypto/Cardano-ADA/fundamentals)

3. Transaction size. It varies but it is around 500 bytes often more. Go here [https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html) and look at the number of transaction in a block and its size, divide.

&#x200B;

So to calculate tps we do: 65536 / 20 / 500 = 6.55tps.

&#x200B;

The Cardano sub is aware of the issue see here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lh21a5/someone\_help\_me\_figure\_this\_out\_max\_tps\_under/](https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lh21a5/someone_help_me_figure_this_out_max_tps_under/) where this issue was discussed quite technically.",171,2021-04-24 12:55:09,385
ADA,cryptocurrency,ADA Could Drop soon or Survive?,"The crypto trader and analyst Dan Gambardello highlighted in a tweet this morning that Cardano (ADA) was able to remain in the top 10 list of the biggest crypto projects despite Robinhood selling off its holdings of the altcoin. In his tweet, he also included his latest technical analysis for ADA.


One of the key things mentioned in Gambardello’s analysis was that ADA was able to secure a spot in a significant Hong Kong index. Despite this positive development, the altcoin’s price is still at risk of losing the support of the 20-day EMA line, which the analyst stated needs to hold as support for the next few days in order to prevent ADA’s price from dropping significantly.


Gambardello did share, however, that he was not confident that the 20-day EMA support will hold in the coming week. Should ADA’s price drop below this level, the analyst predicted that the altcoin’s price may fall to $0.22. On the other hand, if bulls identify ADA’s current level as a buy opportunity, then he believes it could rise to $0.32.

At press time, ADA was trading at $0.2759 according to CoinMarketCap after the Ethereum-killer had printed a 2.36% loss over the past 24 hours.",30,2023-06-28 10:55:00,206

Step 2: send them to a wallet, write down the seed phrase in a piece of paper an store it somewhere safe.

Step 3: delete whatever trading app/website you are using, unsubscribe from al crypto news, forums and whatever, just cut all your connections with crypto and don't even look at the market.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Will DOGE be worth $100 a coin? Can it become as big as ETH? Could Stellar Lumens be worth $1000 a coin? Will Safemoon make me rich?? We all need to look at total supply vs market cap to manage our expectations and be more logical about what is possible.,"The answer to all of those lofty expectations? Impossible. This is a mistake a lot of people are making. You have to look at total supply and multiply it by price per coin to get the market cap. Let’s look at a few popular ones…

Bitcoin is rare like gold, difficult to mine like gold and is used as a store of value like gold. As it becomes more scarce, it will continue to rise in price. It has a total supply of 21 million, of which 18 million are already circulating. After the 21 million are mined, there will be no more available. 18 million x $57k means it has a market cap of over a trillion dollars. That is huge. The total market cap for ALL crypto is 2.38 trillion. Bitcoin is king. Bigger than Visa and MasterCard combined. Bigger than nearly every world bank. It is the world’s 3rd largest currency. 

Ethereum has a total supply of 115 million. More coins than Bitcoin. At the moment, it allows for 18 million to be mined each year max. In July, they are making a change with the London Hardfork, EIP 1559, and every time a transaction is made with ETH, the ETH fees will be burned, making the supply more limited and much more valuable, similar to BTC. Many are saying that ETH will go up to $10k per coin this year because of these changes. When ETH 2.0 is released next year, the price will probably go much higher. With 115 million in circulation, ETH has a market cap of $400 billion. That’s worth more than all of Walmart. 

So, it is really important to check the coin supply and then multiply that by the price you wish it would go to to make you rich. See if the amount seems realistic or not. 

Let’s look at DOGE. Doge has a total supply of 127 billion coins and a max of 10,000 are mined each day [EDIT: DOGE mints 10,000
coins every *minute*, not every day!]. That’s an additional 5 billion coins each year. If you multiply 127 billion coins the $100 you wish it were per coin, it would have a market cap of $12.7 trillion dollars. There is $37 trillion dollars in the world. Is DOGE worth 1/3 of all the money in the world? The entire economy of the United States is $25.3 trillion. Is it realistic to say a meme coin is worth roughly half the US economy…the largest economy in the world?

Let’s take a look at Stellar Lumens. The max supply is $50 billion. The supply increase is 500 million a year, which alone is 23 times the total amount of BTC each year. Anyway, if it were $1000 per coin, the total market cap would be $50 trillion, more than double the US economy. At the very most, maybe they could be $10 each? I say it could be worth $10 because it has actual utility. I think DOGE would top out at $1, and that would be pretty crazy. 

If DOGE were worth as much as ETH, which I’ve seen people on the doge subreddit think might happen, Doge would be worth a modest $388,720,000,000,000. $388 trillion. That’s at least 3 times all the money in the world economy, if Google serves me right.

Then you have to be really careful of coins that are just a rug pull and get promoted on Tik-Tok, like Safemoon. I don’t even need to do the math on Safemoon to know it’s a scam. They will get people to throw all their money into it and then they cash out their supply and take everyone’s money. The total supply for Safemoon is 1 quadrillion coins!!! Stay away from that. Insanity. 

Look at supply of successful coins beyond BTC and ETH and see if you think they could be worth a lot more in the future. Here are some I think worth investing in:

Polkadot (DOT): Total supply: 935.5 million, total supply 1 billion

Chainlink (LINK): Total supply: 419 million, max 1 billion

Cardano (ADA): Total supply: 45 billion. This coin has many great uses, but will not be worth as much as others simply because of the number of circulating coins. Maybe $10-$12 a coin max? But it is under $2 right now. 

ATOM: Total supply: 248 million. New coins are created each year as rewards for people that hold (stake) ATOM. If you can find a good coin that gives you APR, many are 5-6%…much better than a traditional savings account! 

Algorand (ALGO): 2.96 billion, also releases new coins as rewards to people that hold ALGO. 

Tezos (XTZ), circulating supply: 756 million. Total supply: 763 million. 

MANA: this coin is only used for a video game called Decentraland. Atari is making a casino opening in May in that virtual world. Supply available: 1.5 billion. Total supply: 2.6 billion. 

Polygon (MATIC): 10 billion, half in circulation. Because there is a max supply of 10 billion, if it grew to the size of ETH…which won’t happen…each coin would be worth $35 a coin (Take the market cap of ETH and divide it by the supply of MATIC to see what it would be if it were as huge as ETH). It’s under a dollar now. Maybe it could grow to 1/4 of ETH if we’re being optimistic? That would put it at $8.75 a coin. 

Enjin (ENJ) 1 billion coins max, 834 million circulating. 

The list goes on, I just picked a handful of random coins I hear mentioned a lot, but all you need to do to check out what a realistic expectation for a coin is is to take the current supply of tokens, multiply it by what you wish the coin was worth and compare the market cap to BTC or ETH’s market cap, over a trillion and $400 billion, respectively. I don’t expect any alt coin to be worth as much as those those two. And, it bears repeating, the entire cryptocurrency market is worth 2.38 trillion. If you calculate that your coin at $100 is going to be worth double, triple, or quadruple that, I’d say that’s an impossibility. Likewise, you can do the math the other way to see what your coin would be worth per coin if it were as big as ETH or BTC by simply dividing the market cap for ETH or BTC by the number of coins circulating for your prospective coin. Your coin won’t grow as big as those two, but it’s a good way to visualize it and manage your expectations. 

(Note that some of my supply numbers might be off a little, but they should be in the general ballpark)",15393,2021-05-06 02:01:00,3145

After that week, XRP did a 11x in 15 weeks.","Almost 7 days ago, the SEC called many popular tokens a security, such as Cardano, Matic, Solana, Atom, Algorand, Near, and others. They have all seen major losses over the past week. In 7 days, they dropped:

* ADA: -19%
* Solana: -22%
* Matic: -24%
* Atom: -9%
* Near: -14%
* Algo: -10%

Fear is high, and many people have sold or are considering selling. Is it over for these cryptocurrencies? Perhaps not!

&#x200B;

A similar thing happened to XRP, when Ripple was sued by the SEC on December 22, 2020, because XRP was alleged to be a security. XRP instantly started crashing and went down 67% in a week! A much more severe reaction. Everyone panicked and thought it was over. Many people capitulated.

[XRP capitulation: -67&#37; in 7 days.](https://preview.redd.it/orsw1v4ee86b1.png?width=1877&format=png&auto=webp&s=877b3a04fafa9dd6c10500fa93bd0c28534250d7)

.. but it was not the end. A week after the lawsuit started, XRP hit the price of $0.17. That was the ultimate buying moment. From that point, XRP did about a 11x to $1.96 in 15 weeks! Also, the $0.17 price was not seen again.

If you bought the blood, you would still be up more than a 2x now. That said, even now, XRP is below the price of $0.52 - the price it had when Ripple was sued by the SEC.

Im not saying that the same thing must happen to the alts called a security now. But it might be good to know that buying the blood with XRP paid off. It was the final shakeout (""spring"") before liftoff.",78,2023-06-15 19:42:02,150
ADA,cryptocurrency,"Cardano Unveils Smart Contracts Timeline, Pushing ADA",,251,2021-03-26 18:26:38,230
ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano (ADA) presents a get example of learning to dial in expectations. There really is ground between dead and to the moon.,"A fair few posts either talk up a project like it's going to be cool to tattoo it on your ass in a few days or talk it down that it's worse then cancer. It's pretty much why the saying ""Buy the rumour, sell the news"" exists. As people don't know how to dial in expectations to make a fair price judgement.

You need to be realistic with the news, basically see through the hype with your own research. Ask the fundamental questions, and not just leave it to following the crowd.

**Cardano Smart Contracts Example**

The news was painting it as ""this is it, see the explosion of a new dApp ecosystem"". Whereas if you stepped back and realised for that to happen you'd need heaps of independent projects all tested and ready to go off testnet to mainnet.....which definitely was not the case. 

There was no Plutus Application Backend ready, which without kinda prevents dApps developing. If you did some research you'd of discovered that as Cardano didn't make it a secret. Even googling a few of the annouced dApps would of shown it.

The price climbed, people bought into the hype. Smart Contracts arrived and reality hit, price dropped way back. People who blindly followed the hype were pissed, just take a look at the posts on here from then.

**Well that's just hindsight?**

Maybe, but take what's happening now. Sundaeswap is releasing their Dex (in beta but some news sites leave that part off) in a few days on the 20th Jan. ADA has been climbing in price with hype building of ""this is it, see the explosion of a new dApp ecosystem"".

However if you have been just doing a little research, you'll understand that Sundaeswap has said:

*Even with all these factors in play, due to staggering levels of demand and excitement from our community, we expect a large backlog on mainnet as well — even under our most optimistic predictions. To be as transparent as we can, we want to inform you all that while orders (including swapping, providing liquidity andwithdrawing liquidity) may take days to process*

https://sundaeswap.finance/posts/expectations-congestion-mainnet-launch

Which among other reasons is because the Cardano blockchain is only slowly being dialled up in performance. Measure twice and cut once approach. They had this to say about a recent 12.5% increase in performance:

*We are taking a steady, methodical approach to changes in Cardano's parameterization. A 12.5% increase is sizable, but not too big. It leaves room for further expansion, and allows stake pool operators (SPOs) to adjust to the increased demands.*

https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/22/slow-and-steady-wins-the-race-network-evolution-for-network-growth/


**What's it all mean?**

Really what it spells out is that people who don't keep up with things, which is a large percentage, will buy in on the ADA price rise thinking this Dex will be bangin' on day 1. Then they see the Dex come out only to be extremely slow initially. 

No doubt you'll see a bunch of posts basically calling it a complete failure as the ADA price dips on the perceived bad news. 

You can apply this to all project updates, ADA is just a very clean example. With both the project and the blockchain Dev making no secret of what is to come.

**If you dialled in your expectations**

You still need to make a fundamental call on the price of the project. Even with all the hype you may still see it as a buy opportunity.

**If you judge the majority of people have hyped a coming release, feature or update then you can take advantage of the now expected dip when people wake up to reality and sell.**

Research pays off, and hopefully you get to count your fat stacks you beautiful SOB.",253,2022-01-18 07:50:34,169
ADA,cryptocurrency,Is ADA dead?,"It seemed like Cardano had so much going for it with Smart Contract release, staking, and a massive run. I of course bought in too late ($2.97) and have been averaging down for months now. But it just keeps going down.

I am not talking about this little dip, but even last week it just kept going down. I feel like I’m chasing my tale on this one. 

I hear allot of trash talk about ADA, but it never seems to be backed by anything. 

What’s everyone’s thoughts on ADA? Is it just going to collapse back down to a $1.00 or hold strong? Assuming that this dip we are in is not the end of the Bear.

Edit: Allot of very thoughtful responses, thank you all! Sorry if the title is a bit dramatic, seems like sometimes that’s what it takes in the feed to get participation.",72,2021-11-17 04:10:40,339
ADA,cryptocurrency,I got Hacked and lost over 300K Today,"This is my first post and my most sad one to date. There of my wallets got hacked totaling over 300k.

I'm a ***complete moron*** for storing passwords and seed phrases for these accounts in Evernote here.

Metamask - 0x023D8a816A8b6394f3144fD74aA3820689fEcaA0

Rocketpool Node - 0xa24757BC32579541F33B1bCD2E36355D39B1686a \[withdrawl address was changed\]

I'm a big fan of MOONs and had over 80k. I can see the hacker swapped all my Metamask assets into ETH where they are currently stored at this address - 0xe147a73e7d783166f791f10342a0122db80814c4

I'm absolutely devastated and not sure what to do.

Should I contact the FBI?

It appears the hacker could be from Germany based on the Evernote access logs. I could be wrong and both logins could be from a VPN. **\[UPDATE - These login attempts came from a TOR Exit Node as mentioned in the comments. The below, however, was the first attempt to connect to my Evernote. It was not a successful login.\]**

My biggest loss is the Rocketpool Node. I may have the first compromised node? He changed the withdrawl address to - 0x8294b95d303949699167f7579c9da49f6359d4ff. I can do nothing while he collects rewards. I believe I have some time here since nothing can be physcially withdrawn until the Shanghai Upgrade.

Lastly the Deadalus account had maybe 8k in ADA where it currently hits in the Hackers address here - addr1q8lee9tt64w6uwj9xwne2hnca8x8e2vg87prhl43uqdhdgk232uaxahskg735wxx28xwrhjj97fhphnyz3ppn3fjpygsywcdlv

Thanks again and I deserve all the shame headed my way!

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 1 -** Thanks for the love and support. I biggest concern is the Rocketpool Node which has about 250k staked. I can't change the the withdrawl address but looking at other options since the hacker can't withdraw until Shanghai upgrade

I was not only personally insulted in PMs, called a FUDer and an liar by the vast majority of Cardano holders, but was also told that Cardano dapps would be running 1 week after Alonzo Fork and dexes like Sudaeswap and ERGO would be fully functional any “moment” after the Alonzo Fork.

So, are there any news about that?? Did the concurrency problem get resolved? If yes, why are there no functioning dexes on Cardano yet? Can someone from the Cardano community enlighten us please?",5973,2021-11-24 14:53:39,3015

***Find the full blog post with all the tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the FOUR YEAR REPORT for the 2018 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, NEM, DASH, IOTA,** and **Stellar.**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting every single month for four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and more recently, the [2022 Top Ten a few weeks ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/). ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.
* **December** **Highlights:** A bloody, all-red month
* **Overall since Jan. 2018:** **ETH** solidly in the lead, followed by **BTC** and **ADA.**  After briefly pulling ahead earlier in the year, ***the 2018 Top Ten are now significantly underperforming the S&P 500*** over the same time period.  Q: So, big crypto fail, right?
* A: Only if I stopped after the first year.  The **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 406%, much, much better than traditional markets over the same time period (**fancy new chart at the very bottom of the post).

***Some exciting new changes for*** [2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!***

1. I'll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis (down to two reports per month)
2. Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time. 
3. Factoring in stablecoin gains:  In past years, I have not included the ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports.  This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).
4. Giveaways: Who doesn’t love a good old fashioned giveaway? I’ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I’m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.
5. Friendly competition: I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP r/TotalCryptoMarketCap) to see which one outperforms.

And here we go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Four Year Report – UP 34%

https://preview.redd.it/c3c6wlctpgb81.jpg?width=1056&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=380248b14486edaa5749fba7a390198bf81260a0

Welcome to the four year report!

The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, IOTA, NEM, Dash,** and **Stellar**.  

December highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **100% red month**. **IOTA** falls the least, only down -4% (on news that staking on the Firefly wallet will yield two cryptos, Assembly and Shimmer).
* **ETH** maintains a solid overall lead, **BTC** in second place, **ADA** in third.  Three coins in the green since January 2018.
* After four years, the 2018 Portfolio is +34%, behind the S&P 500’s ROI over the same time period.

## December Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in ranks since January 2018:

https://preview.redd.it/ulc9dwgvpgb81.jpg?width=412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2eadc9a98ec75b726cef37af7cb716fddf3126db

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:** After four years of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have remained.  **NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA**, and **Litecoin** have been replaced by **Binance Coin, Tether**, **DOT, SOL**, **LUNA**, and **USDC.  NEM** looks like it wants to be the first to drop out of the Top 100.

## December Winners and Losers

***December Winners*** –  **IOTA** outperformed the pack, dropping only -4% this month. 100% of the cryptos in the red.

***December Losers*** –   Losing nearly a third of its value, **Litecoin** fell the most, down -30%. **NEM** followed **LTC**, dropping -27% in December.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After four years, here’s a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment. 

https://preview.redd.it/lisz7rgxpgb81.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbf41f94e9716f0140f3a7dfff3f655fa9d21a59

With 11, **Bitcoin** has two more monthly wins than second place **Cardano**.  **NEM** has finished last place most often (12 months out of 48).

**Bitcoin** is still the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).

## Overall Update –  2021 ends with a whimper. After four years, ETH in first place, and Dash and NEM tied for worst overall performance.

After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in [October](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46), the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio continued to lose value.  After four years of holding these cryptos, only 3 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green: **BTC,** **ETH,** and **ADA.**

Overall, first place **ETH** (+413%) is well ahead of **BTC** (+257%) and third place **ADA** (+99%).

The initial $100 invested in first place **ETH** four years ago?  It’s worth $515 today.

**DASH** and **NEM** are virtually tied at the bottom, both down over -86% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.**  The initial $100 invested in each four ago is worth about $13 today.  

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/mldnsr7zpgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=d82435bc0e39657707f2143fb5dd1951f6ddcfd1

End of December 2021 market cap: **$2,211,626,655,207**

The total crypto market dropped significantly in December.  Crypto as a sector is still up +285% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+34%), the return of the S&P (+78%) over the same period of time, and nine of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for **Ethereum)**.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.65T in** [**October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/)**.**

## Bitcoin dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/qygnx0a0qgb81.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=567958cf7214839fa7befa749d61125dade6a9a8

**BitDom** declined a bit in December, ending the month at 40.2%.  When looking at the entire four year 2018 Experiment time frame, **BTC** dominance is near the low end.  For context:   

Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**33% in January 2018**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one).

High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: 

https://preview.redd.it/cxtd9lb1qgb81.jpg?width=339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25b3da0034194812e2b66f977450fff1555b48fb

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost $325 in December.

If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, **the $1000 initial investment would be worth $1,341**, up 34% from [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

Green is unfamiliar territory for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio and a recent development.  Over the first four years of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only ten months of green.  And all ten of the green months have come in 2021. 

Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment four years ago:

https://preview.redd.it/cbumx113qgb81.jpg?width=654&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bba9861143359ff6b70ff0ca8e6ba75de5d00d6

The all time high for this portfolio is [October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46) (+72%).  The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down [\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).   

Remember: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.  The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.

But I didn’t stop the Experiment in 2018:  I invested another $1000 in the ***2019***, ***2020,*** and ***2021*** Top Ten Cryptos as well (***(and, just announced,*** [***again in 2022***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!)***.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?    

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48): up +34% (total value $1,341)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36) up +504% (total value $6,044)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24): up +795% (total value $8,951)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +292% (total value $3,921)

So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,257** ($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).

**That’s up +406%** on the combined portfolios, **down from** [**last month’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47) for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/xcl80o35qgb81.jpg?width=511&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2cd4923360a5492259faf606b3649c893fd4b16

***That’s a +406% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four years in a row.***

## Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  

https://preview.redd.it/3uss07c8qgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e68ae4c88a82ff35b70538ec11dd137e83447e2

After four years: the S&P 500 is up +78% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) would be worth $1,780 had it been redirected to the S&P.  That’s more than double the +34% return of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio over the same period of time.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,430** ($1,780 + $1,900 + $1,480 + $1,270)

That is up **+61%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+406%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Cardano Ada Reaches New All-time High As Smart Contract Countdown Continues,,265,2021-08-23 15:52:12,174
ADA,cryptocurrency,"For the newcomers: the top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence.","I tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
15. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
17. **Bitcoin SV (BSV)\*:** Bitcoin Scam Variant
18. **EOS (EOS):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
19. **Elrond (EGLD):** Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR)\*:** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
37. **SushiSwap (SUSHI):** a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
38. **Binance USD (BUSD):** Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.
39. **FTX Token (FTT):** It’s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.
40. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the token of Crypto.com public blockchain, that tries to enable transaction worldwide between people and businesses.
41. **Filecoin (FIL):** a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services.
42. **UMA (UMA):** it builds open-source infrastructure in order to create synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain
43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",14815,2021-02-09 12:03:25,1588
ADA,cryptocurrency,Former ADA Skeptic. More skeptical of this sub now.,"I've historically never owned ADA, loathed its community on social media, and I don't buy anything unless there's some something to actually use.

Used Sundaeswap... Nice.

In addition to the growing dismissal and negative sentiment of r/cc in regards to Cardano after shilling it obscenely. I'm convinced the weak hands are out and I have made my first purchase.

Always counter trade the sentiment of this subreddit. That's my rule. I recently graduated school in the summer and started crypto in March 2021. I am heavily in the green, paid off all my student loans, and I can objectively say its largely because of this rule. Please please please actually DYOR, and don't assume someone here who told you to actually did theirs.

Look at Tokenomics, and ask why is this token needed. What will make the value of this token go up in the long run? Is this token inflationary, do the rewards for holding make up for the inflation? These are the type of questions you should be asking.

This subreddit was shilling vechain quite hard in the past. Made an entry without doing any of those things. Finally figured it out, luckily exited in profit. It is now less than it was when I entered, almost 25% less. If Algo reminds you of this, it should. Actually research the tokenomics, look at the price action, and the vesting schedule.

Stay safe everyone. Stack blue chips projects while you still can (btc, eth, Link, etc.). Focus on adoption that's how you will win. Don't capitulate and sell on your own terms.

Update: I read several times that I think I'm a genius even though re-reading this I don't see it. If it's there, I fully retract my statements. 

Also finishing school, doesn't make me naive or young & dumb. Med school is difficult. Come by my hospital, I'll still try and save you despite any negative comments you made.",119,2021-12-13 16:39:25,239
ADA,cryptocurrency,"Bullish ADA Analysis, will we reach 3$? Correction incoming! See the graph and analysis!","Ada has been in a strong bullish tendency, we had little correction until now, Price went from 1 to 2 usd very quick after the MACD turned to buyer, something like this only happened before at May and we can say the price went up fast. we are seeing the same scenario now, the price is going high fast, being supported by a great and continuous Buy Volume and a strong MACD, got to say that thing are looking much better now than in May. Here is the graph:  


[Bullish tendency supported by MACD and Volume similarly as May](https://preview.redd.it/u4bpqh6ducj71.png?width=1637&format=png&auto=webp&s=654c3199522d1088d785d23bde5a35114563b62e)

I use a Fibonacci project to find the targets, we already past most of them and can expect a huge fight for the price between buyers and sellers now, we reached 80% of fibo which is satisfactory zone where many will sell to earn after the bull run, but we can expect it to reach 100% of Fibonacci easily. At 50% fibo (2.48$)  we saw a little fight for the price, players indeed took a breath before continuing the movement and now at 80% (2.82$) we saw a bigger fight for the price. In my opinion we can expect the price to reach the zone of 3.088$ this week before a stronger correction, but remember everything about this coin is bullish based on this graph, the MACD is still very buyer and the volume is consistent positively. Prepare your diamond hands for a correction once it reaches 3$\~3.1$. If you like my analysis drop an Upvote, I need those beautiful moons, and if you want a correction analysis when it reaches 3$ tell me!",201,2021-08-24 19:18:24,202
ADA,cryptocurrency,"The Bullish Case for Tezos, with ETH-DOT-ADA advices (Update New Metrics)","**Quick Overview of Tezos**:  Tezos is a public, open-source, self-amending smart contract protocol, one of the biggest ICOs ever,  based on a liquid proof of stake consensus model and allowing for  digital asset transactions and smart contracts execution. The network  officially went live in 2018 known as the Genesis block (the network has  upgraded 7 times since then and is currently on the Granada block) and  the native currency on the Tezos blockchain is the Tez (symbol: XTZ).  Expanded detail regarding on-chain governance, LPOS, Delegation.

Tezos  was founded by Arthur and Kathleen Breitman (married) and the money  raised in the ICO was provided to the Tezos Foundation that is overseen  by a committee/board with a variety of cryptoindustry experts. The  Tezos Foundation helps oversee the Tezos ecosystem and part of the role  it plays is the issuance of grants to prospective new platforms and  protocols. The Tezos Foundation currently manages over $1.2 billion  which is used for grants, awareness, development, marketing, etc

Valuation:  Figured I would cut straight to the juicy part first. I have found the  best way to value smart contract platforms would be a multiple of their  usage, which can be quantified by smart contract calls (“SCC”). Another  way you could value these platforms is applying a multiple of TVL across  the entire network, but those numbers are often inflated and not always  accurate. Below is a comparison of valuations for Ethereum and Tezos:

https://preview.redd.it/tugintdoqcr71.png?width=793&format=png&auto=webp&s=614f231ec75eac803bf3627c71f7ea3b83f63628

At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at a higher multiple of smart   contract calls compared to Tezos. This makes sense given the fact that   Ethereum’s network is much larger than Tezos and has the most widespread   adoption. However, the growth in smart contract calls has slowed  across  Ethereum as seen in the chart below (Ethereum is currently at  \~3.2M SCC  per day):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/89drz6uxqcr71.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&s=6091ce3ecc52d789189278870dc572d63da6b18b

Tezos on the other hand is seeing exponential growth across the network   and is currently averaging \~190k smart contract calls per day:

https://preview.redd.it/3orbyth9rcr71.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=d45b5a89197deb7a4919abcf1966bac5d4016d1b

Using a daily run-rate of 190k SCC per day, Tezos  in September reached 5.7M+ smart contract calls. Growing 35% monthly the remainder of 2021 will mean Tezos reaches 14M smart  contract  calls in the month of December.

**As a result, by year end Tezos should theoretically be valued at $23.49 per Tez.**

For   those who enjoy sensitivity tables, see below what Tezos could   theoretically be valued at across various monthly smart contract call   volumes and multiples. If you assume that there would be multiple   expansion from Tezos becoming a larger network with higher usage, the   valuation of $23.49 by year end 2021 at a 1.4x multiple looks extremely   conservative (again, Ethereum’s multiple of SCC is 3.2x):

https://preview.redd.it/t2rbymworcr71.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=b19737585acb5877225795c1d9ad9d7fd131ea46

To close this section out, below are  some interesting metrics on Tezos and Ethereum at the time of writing.  Ethereum Daily Transactions (1.2M): Ethereum Daily SCC (3.2M):  Tezos  Daily Transactions (667k, almost 60% of Ethereum's):  Tezos Daily SCC  (190k).

Smart  Contract Calls: Interaction with a smart contract, for example,  initiating a “Harvest All” of farming rewards. Transactions: On chain  transactions, for example, after initiating a “Harvest All” for rewards,  if you are providing to liquidity to 3 different pairs then your  rewards will be sent to you in 3 separate transactions

Why Tezos?

**Secure Smart Contracts:**   the process of formal verification, based on Michelson programming   language, provides the mathematical proof of the correctness of the   contract, that can be verified automatically. It is the golden standard   of ""trustless"" guarantee in a blockchain system.

**Participative Governance:**  ""Bakers"" can submit and/or vote on a propose due to the very efficient  on-chain formal voting procedure.  By extension, all Tez holders can  express their opinion by delegating  their Tez to a Baker that shares  the same view on a given subject (to  consult the voting history of a  given baker, click on a baker from the then access the ""voting"" tab)

**Proven Upgradeable Network without Forks:**   Tezos’ formal on-chain governance model has already allowed for 7  (yes,  7) smooth, successful upgrades of the Tezos protocol and lets  Tezos  stay on top of innovation (Granada was the most recent upgrade:

https://preview.redd.it/g4fg5u4rrcr71.png?width=1102&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d30b0182f16d90e1ae93d6689b0288810ef0c61

This is a major advantage over other  blockchains and gives Tezos the  ability to quickly incorporate proven  features of other chains or innovate with proprietary upgrades  (liquidity baking: Additional notable upgrades include reduction of gas  fees and block times (now 30 seconds), TPS (now around 200).

While   all this is great, what makes Tezos exciting is that there are always   additional network improvements on the horizon, specifically the   TenderBake upgrade coming sometime in Q4 2021/Q1 2022 will push that up   to 1000 TPS and near instant finality meaning block times will be 1   second or less.

**Energy-efficient/Low gas fees:** Tezos has been quoted at being **8000x less expensive**   and more energy efficient than its peer Ethereum. POS requires   significantly less energy than POW (which is part of the reason Ethereum   is looking to upgrade to ETH 2.0)

**POS Staking and Deflationary Economics:**   At each block, 80 new Tezos are created and distributed to the bakers   and then to respective delegators. Currently you can earn between 5%-6%   in rewards by staking your Tezos with a baker with \~80% of all Tezos   currently staked (you can delegate your Tezos to a baker through Ledger   Live, for example). You can also stake with centralized custodians such   as Coinbase, but as the saying goes “not your keys, not your coins”  and  they also take a hefty fee leaving you with closer to 4% returns.  The  big misconception with the POS concept is that many people confuse  Tezos  with being inflationary (they think in % terms) when in reality  the %  will decrease over time because it is based on the **amount of Tezos created at each block**,   which over time is divided by a larger Total Supply (i.e. Tezos is   deflationary). As many of you are aware, Ethereum is attempting to   switch to POS with ETH 2.0, so it is a similar concept but extremely   hard to implement without having to fork the network. In the last   section of this post, I provide an overview for beginners looking to   stake their Tezos and earn 5-6%, which is a safe and secure way to earn a   modest return.

The recent  Granada proposal that went live at the  end of July added a new DEX  contract to the Tezos protocol between Tez  and tzBTC. This contract is  unique because the protocol itself creates  additional Tez at every  block (2.5) and adds them to the contract. This  incentivizes users to  provide liquidity to the contract in order to  capture a portion of the  subsidy (this added bonus to liquidity  providers is set to expire 6  months after the upgrade went, so it is not  permanent).

I’m Intrigued, Where Do I Start?

All  major CEX allow you to trade Tezos – if you’re looking for DEX/AMM I  would point you to Plenty  and Quipuswap . Kukai and Temple are great  wallets to use (similar to Metamask) that allow you to manage  your  Tezos and various FA1.2 and FA2 tokens (which are Tezos’  equivalent to  ERC20 / ERC 721 tokens, although FA2 has NFT capabilities  for example,  so it is not apples to apples). I typically link my Ledger  Nano to  Kukai which allows me to 1) view my Tezos and FA1.2/FA2 tokens  and 2)  interact with platforms such as Plenty to stake/farm/trade at  extremely  low gas fees (we are talking gas fees in USD pennies). If you  have  ERC20 tokens, you have the ability to WRAP those onto the Tezos  network  (examples include: wLINK, wAAVE, wWETH, wWBTC, wBUSD, wUSDC,  wMATIC,  etc.), you can actually do that on Bender Labs’ WRAP platform.  It is  extremely easy and is an efficient way to get 5 your tokens onto  the  Tezos network to start playing around with DeFi on Tezos and earn  high  interest from farming.

Below is a  screencap of some (not  all) of the farming options offered by Plenty – I  encourage you to visit  their site and poke around. Right now, Plenty  offers high rewards in  the form of Plenty DAO, which is extremely  lucrative at the moment, and I  would recommend anyone looking to dip  their toes in DeFi to give this a  shot. APRs currently are in the high  300%-400% (these APRs are not  updated to reflect the temporary double  rewards that are shown in the  picture below so it is even higher at the  moment). You will be amazed at  how far less expensive it is to use  DeFi on Tezos versus Ethereum which  makes it more fun to interact with  (again, gas fees are pennies). Even  if you believe that Ethereum will  hold the throne in the realm long  term, you can still earn a  significant amount of Plenty and exchange it  over time to your favorite  ERC-20 tokens that are wrapped on Tezos, and  then unwrap them onto the  Ethereum network (although once you see the  fee difference between  Tezos and Ethereum you may not want to!).

QuipuSwap   is also a great reliable DEX that is similar to Plenty. Personally, I   have found Plenty a bit easier to use and the rewards are better than   any other DEX built on Tezos (QuipuSwap does offer a few more trading   pairs at the moment). Again, providing liquidity has its risk of   impairment loss, but currently the reward potential seems to outweigh   that risk at least in the near term. APRs of 300%+ you should be yelling   sign me up!

[Additionally, Kolibri \(LINK\)  is a lending platform that you can borrow  kUSD with Tezos as collateral  \(BTB has touched on this strategy before,  it is risky, but the same  concept applies to what you can do in  various ways on the Ethereum  network\). There are various other DeFi  platforms that are listed in the  below Ecosystem chart that you can do  research on and play around with  as well.](https://preview.redd.it/enl9ec6urcr71.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff3313214e39c31a0e3fead7e56193425014a01e)

**Broader Tezos Ecosystem:**  As you will  see below, the Tezos ecosystem is robust and flourishing  with many  different platforms and projects across a variety of buckets.  One recent  notable partnership that is noteworthy is the 6 launch of **OneOf**  ,  a green NFT platform built on Tezos that connects artists and fans  via  NFTs. This partnership highlights the focus on the “Green”/energy   efficient movement a lot of companies have and exemplifies that Tezos is   the perfect network for that (in addition to its other advantages).   Adoption of NFTs on Tezos have been exponential, those that currently   are in the space might be familiar with **Hic Et Nunc**  (which means ""here and now"") which is the most popular NFT marketplace  on Tezos. For those looking to get into NFTs on Tezos, I would start  here.

[Another recent platform that just launched is Homebase \(LINK\),  a web  application that enables users to create and manage\/use DAOs on  the  Tezos blockchain. This application aims to help empower community   members and developers to launch and participate in Tezos-based DAO’s.   An entire post can be written about DAO’s in general, but this   highlights the continued adoptability of Tezos as well as the various   ways smart contract platforms are disrupting society \(in addition to   DeFi, NFTs, stablecoins, STOs, etc.\).](https://preview.redd.it/qyapq76zrcr71.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=60b871bd11d0366ca4c0cc9d598c75352cfaa015)

**But what about Solana/DOT/Cardano?**

These   platforms do share (according to their white papers) some similar   characteristics to Tezos. One thing that makes them really stand out in   the broader market is the incredible amount of marketing that each   network and their teams have done. However, as many of you know, the   hype created around coins often outweighs the actual fundamental value   until the platform can actually prove out the concept and execute.   Marketing, roadmaps, and hype only end up working for so long unless   there is actual adoption of the network. At some point, these platforms   will either succeed or fall hard on their face. Tezos on the other hand   has taken a different approach over the past 3 years and instead  focused  on building out a strong ecosystem that has tangible widespread  use  (second to Ethereum as far as daily/monthly smart contract calls  which  is the main indicator of a smart contract network usage). Keep in  mind  that smart contract calls and transactions are two different  things and  are often times confused as being the same. The Tezos  strategy of  choosing to build out a network (first) and marketing  (second) has been a  point of contention within the Tezos community (the  contention being  the lack of marketing) which many people attribute  slow price/valuation  action, but the reality is Tezos is fully  functional while many other  smart contract networks are still a white  paper / roadmap with far less  adoption.

**What  does that mean for you? You have the  potential to enter a fully  functioning smart contract platform that is  seeing exponential growth  at a steep relative value discount to where  these other peer networks  are trading.** Cardano does not  currently have smart contract  capabilities (still a promise on the  roadmap and in the whitepaper).  Polkadot (copy pasta of ETH) is still in  its testnet phase. Solana  (copy pasta of ETH) is valued at $50B+ and  claims to have a functioning  network but can’t seem to provide public  smart contract call level  data. Tezos, in comparison, has a strong  fundamentally established  network, has proven its ability to upgrade the  network with its  self-amending protocol, high-profile partnerships,  exponential growth  via monthly smart contract calls (due to growth  across DeFi, NFTs,  Stablecoins, and STOs), and a solid decentralized  foundation / team. I  am not suggesting that these other networks won’t  also continue to see  success, but Tezos is a great investment  considering its development  over the past 3 years.

Lastly, of  the  many partnerships that Tezos has (for example, Red Bull Racing),  the one  with the New York Mets (and subsequent mainstage advertisement  in the  stadium each game) is no coincidence. A quick Google of who the  Mets  owner is should have you chomping at the bit

**Quote:** “*I   think we need a new term: Ethereum extenders. Because that is what  they  are doing. They all use the EVM and solidity. They copy paste  Ethereum  dapps. They inherit all the strengths and all the weaknesses  of  Ethereum. They are Ethereum. They are derivatives of Ethereum.

ADA,cryptocurrency,“Give a man a steak and he will eat for a day but teach a man to stake and he will eat forever”,"Staking is a phenomenal way for the average person to make money. By staking you are 1. Contributing to something bigger then you and most importantly 2. You will make as much as if you were invested in an ETF in the stock market. Yes the price of the coin can go down which is a notable risk factor. However, staking the right coin is a very great opportunity which everyone should at least look into.

ADA,cryptocurrency,1st ADA DEX just launched.,"Disclaimer: My piggy bank is 28% ADA.


I am of the opinion that one of the legitimacy ADA currently lacks is a prolific DEX and the current Haskell barrier. I like Haskell (Yes, it has a learning barrier but I'm of the opinion of security >>> ease of use), their scientific approach and as long as there is regular progress, I'll still be in.


Now, the very first DEX on Cardano just launched: [MuesliSwap.](https://ada.muesliswap.com/) You can tell, as an ADA hodler, I was ecstatic to find out because I was expecting SundaeSwap to be the first. So I started digging and was met with some red flags. I'm just here to provide you some info from Cardano sub.

ADA,cryptocurrency,"Dear newbies, are you looking for a promising coin under $1, or even under $0.1? Don't!","**EDIT: read the post before you shill your sub-$1-coins, please, why does nobody do this today?**

I always see these posts a lot, but for some reason more in the past few days:

*""what are the best coins under $X?""*

And sure, it looks like that makes sense - Bitcoin (BTC) is super expensive already, while a coin like BitTorrent (BTT) is available for less than one cent! If you buy some now and they become as expensive as Bitcoin you will be rich! Bitcoin also used to be cheap! Right?

Lol, nah, wrong, obviously. The thing is: coin price doesn't matter. At all. Because it is strongly affected by how many coins are in circulation. There are currently about 18,700,000 BTC in circulation, there will never be more than 21,000,000. But there are 660,000,000,000 BTT at the moment and there will be 990,000,000,000 at some point. The important figure is the market cap, which is

**Market Cap =  Circulating Supply  X Coin Price**

So, for example, for BTC it would be  49,500 X 18,700,000, about 920 billion USD. So if we imagine BitTorrent becoming just as big as Bitcoin, how much would a single coin be worth? $1.38. So can't a single BTT be worth thousands of dollars, like BTC is? No, absolutely not. If 1 BTT would be worth 49,500, as 1 BTC currently is, its market cap once all the coins are in circulation would be almost 50,000,000,000,000,000. 50 quadrillion, or 50,000 trillion. The total amount of wealth in the world is about 300 trillion.

**tl;dr:** Coin price is NOT a good indicator how much a coin can still grow. Check the market cap and compare it to other coins to see how much a coin would need to grow to be as big as another coin. [The Coin Perspective](https://thecoinperspective.com) is a great website to make these comparisons. Also remember that you can buy fractions of a coin, like 0.001 BTC and don't have to buy a whole one.",8758,2021-05-15 15:08:46,1678

ADA,cryptocurrency,"For the love of god, please learn what market caps are","I’m seeing so many people just not have any understanding of one of the most basic measurements of valuation. If you don’t know what “market cap” means and you’re trying to get in early on “moonshots,” I’m begging you to take 2 minutes to read.

Market capitalization is the total value of all members of an asset. Just circulating supply * price. (Edited note: worth mentioning that you should be using the average price over different platforms. THAT BEING SAID: if the platform you’re looking at shows a price that would imply a market cap in the quadrillions, then that DOES mean the price is too high there. Even though the market cap calculated by that price wouldn’t be an accurate measurement of the combined value of the coin, it IS a good indicator of whether or not it will actually be able to maintain that price. If it’s not an accurate price, arbitrage is going to correct the price soon enough.) 

What does it tell us? It lets us know how much ~~money~~ value is attributed to it, and how it compares to other coins.


Take SHIB for an example. It has a circulating supply of **400 trillion tokens,** so at its price of 0.003¢, it has a market cap of nearly $12 BILLION. That’s 1/5 of doge’s cap of $60B, and it is therefore already one of the largest cryptocurrencies out there.

At 10¢, the market cap would be $40 trillion, double the US annual GDP. It will not hit 10¢. It will not hit 1¢z It will not hit 0.1¢. It MIGHT hit 0.01¢ because of how the market has been working lately, but those other targets are just mathematically far too high.

(Another edited note: when I say reach that price, I meant having a stable price that high on most/all trading platforms. Thanks to those of you who corrected me on that)

The creators want you to see all those zeros in front of the price and assume buying it would be “getting in early.” Don’t let them fool you. You are not getting in early by buying a coin with a $12B market cap. You are almost certainly very very very late.

DYOR. Please.

Edit:

A lot of people are hung up on “how much money is in it.” I didn’t mean it in terms of principal investment, I meant it in terms of valuation. I have a lot of BAT that I bought at 30 cents. I don’t value it as if it were the 30 cents per token that I bought it at, because I know I can just sell at the market price if I need to.

The argument that it would crash if everyone tired to sell at once is fallacious. It’s valued at what it is and it ISN’T crashing to nothing from everyone selling at once because people aren’t trying to all sell at once. They would rather have the BAT than the $1.30. If they didn’t, they would have sold already.

Edit 2:

Think I came off wrong here. Not a financial expert, that much is obvious. I know that things can crash from everyone selling, I was trying to say that everyone selling is BECAUSE they value the coin’s value in fiat/btc/eth/whatever less than they do the coin.

Second, I know there are flaws in it, as it can’t be instantly converted. I’m not trying to make it out to be some perfect metric of value. My intentions here are solely to tell people that their millions of scamcoin that they bought for $10 probably is not going to make them a 9 figure crypto whale.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Welcome to the scary part of crypto. This is where gains are made.,"If you are new to crypto, these times can be scary. It's uneasy for all of us.

But it's at these times gains are made. Not by trading (for some, sure) but by studying and planning your strategy. Now it's time for you to do your research on which coins you believe in and align your bags accordingly. 

**It's true what they say, ""Time in the market, beats timing the market""**. So don't over-leverage, don't sell high or on the way down, and stick to projects/coins you believe in. If you believe in crypto, your goal is to still be in this game years down the road. 

And it's way more profitable than jumping ship from coin to coin depending on what's pumping. Plus you will learn a lot along the way.

Once you've aligned your bags accordingly, all you need to do is to lay in a coma, trust your intuition and try to keep yourself from refreshing prices 24/7. 

This part is difficult for all of us to do, but it's important. Doing this is a lot easier if you have hobbies or things you're passionate about outside crypto. So try to pick up a new hobby or do something that keeps you from looking at charts every 5 minutes and FOMO into any shitcoin that's pumping this day. 

Best of luck to all of you.",8187,2021-05-16 12:37:04,1746

ADA,cryptocurrency,Reddit makes it nearly impossible for you to find coins early,"I've seen a lot of posts complaining about how r/cryptocurrency only shills stagnant coins that have already pumped. And coins like SHIB, LRC, KDA, and SOL are never mentioned until after they explode. 

This is entirely by design. Your exposure to posts on reddit is a function of how many upvotes those posts have received. And the more bagholders a particular coin has, the more upvotes. Which is why the front page is a billboard for ADA, ETH, ALGO, VET, and a handful of others. By definition, the coins you repeatedly see here already have large numbers of holders. You don't get rich buying something that everyone else already owns. Hence why projects start to stagnate when they become popular. Popularity on r/cryptocurrency is actually a great indicator for when growth can be expected to taper. Cardano is perhaps a prime example. 

By contrast, posts about undiscovered projects will almost universally be buried. There may well have been a post shilling SOL at $1 or SHIB in 2020, but they never would have made it past the last page.",5245,2021-11-09 13:47:35,2437
ADA,cryptocurrency,"For those of you who weren't here during the bear market, Cardano dumped from above $1 to $0.03 and no one talked about it because they had delivered nothing but empty promises for 3 years despite intense marketing and hundreds of millions of dollars in funding. Do you really think anything changed?","The main focus throughout the bear market was the development of the Ethereum ecosystem. That is why the most popular dApps are all currently comfortably situated on the Ethereum main network. Yes, Ethereum's price dumped during the bear market as well, but the OGs in the space and all of the developers kept their eyes laser focused on the development happening within the Ethereum ecosystem.

I personally believe there are several solid alternatives to Ethereum (Polygon, Avalanche, Solana), but unless such networks have built a bridge to Ethereum, they likely will not survive. That is why all of the chains I mentioned were forced to develop bridges to Ethereum because no developer in their right mind would leave the Ethereum ecosystem for a risky sidechain or other layer 1 network. I do not think Cardano will be any different, but this is just my opinion.

Unless someone can tell me otherwise, I am not aware of any actively used dApp that has committed to migrating from other chains to Cardano. Unless you see the likes of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, Synthetix, USDC, and Yearn talk about migrating to Cardano, there really isn't anything to talk about with regard to ""Cardano killing Ethereum"". Hint: they'll never migrate.

I'm posting this because I'm getting sick of the manic Cardano threads where bagholders are desperately trying to get others to buy so the price goes higher and they can sell. Yes, they are scheduled to release smart contracts soon, but the biggest question remains, ***who is going to use their platform***? I have seen extraordinarily innovative developments being made on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and those did not happen overnight and it's hard to imagine people just packing up their bags and leaving to work on Cardano.

To all of the people about to yell at me for making another ""Cardano is overhyped post"" I want you to take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror: have you ever actually *used* Ethereum? Polygon? Avalanche? Solana? Have you ever actually *used* a decentralized exchange, lending protocol, NFT marketplace/game, or provided liquidity to these networks? I have. I've done all of it. So do you really have the perspective to be arguing about ""Ethereum killers"" and how ""great"" Cardano will be when you don't even have experience with engaging and interacting with smart contracts?

Where is all of your hype really coming from, the echo chambers on Twitter and Reddit? I'm asking because I fell for the same ""academic scientific approach"" marketing in 2017 and it's just the same cycle over and over again - Cardano is great at making money during bull markets, but not very good at delivering promised products, but I really hope I'm wrong this time.

!remindme 8 months

EDIT: Maybe some users in the comment section can look at one another and realize that there is not a single rebuttal to my points (removed technical because one user is right, I didn't really provide ""technical"" arguments). Every post is about price action. Will Cardano potentially make you some money this bull run? Sure, that is, if you aren't stuck holding bags while everyone sells the top. But please, let's stay on topic. Present some counterarguments related to the actual utility of the network.

EDIT 2: People should be aware that there was very similar hype surrounding Cardano leading up to the Coinbase [listing date](https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-launching-on-coinbase-pro-694b1cb8c778?gi=2495f7011d1c) (March 16-18), and the hype pump peaked at 1.38 (ATH at the time) on March 17, dumped to 1.24 (-10%) by March 18, and continued to dump to 1.06 (-25%) by March 24. Sure, it kept going up, and we may see a similar ""pump, dump, pump"" related to the smart contract release, but the ""pump"" following the ""dump"" all depends on execution and whether people actually care to use Cardano's platform.

EDIT 3: Thanks to a great comment by u/BornToBeHwild, I learned that Cardano is already developing and supporting an Ethereum bridge ([https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/)), which proves my point entirely - Cardano won't ""kill everything in this space"", they are already building measures to integrate with the existing ecosystem and adapt, so maybe it's time to stop saying it will end all of the progress that has already been made in decentralized finance and media and take over the world.

EDIT 4: I realize that my post is very triggering and I will edit the language a bit to emphasize the points I'm trying to make and remove some of the more triggering elements. Sometimes you forget in all of the mania that people have money at stake and I by no means am trying to ""FUD"" Cardano. I have friends and family who own this coin and I actually like Charles as he introduced me to a lot of the concepts I learned about in this space through his videos and lectures. I hope Cardano succeeds.

The point of my post was that people need to understand there already a ton of great, functioning products out there that all promised similar ""Ethereum killing"" capabilities that ultimately had to adapt and integrate with Ethereum in order to remain relevant and I do not think Cardano will be any different (see EDIT 3). Just trying to set expectations, especially for newcomers who are probably feeling FOMO for Cardano and are tempted to buy it while it's up x2 it's 2017 ATH and at the peak of its bull run. I'm not saying it won't go higher, but I do think the mania can be harmful for people who are just getting into the space now.

EDIT 5: I want to bring attention to a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vgije?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in this thread made by u/Bwahehe, which is not getting enough upvotes and perfectly articulates the point I am getting across:

>ETH is like Manhattan. Horribly crowded with insane traffic, but they're doing a ton of business.  
>  
>Cardano is like someone selling a potentially lucrative spot of land but absolutely no businesses are there yet. They promise that they'll finish the roads in a month or two but they'll be some damn amazing and scientifically proven roads.  
>  
>Most up and coming smart contract coins promise massive highways and roads but nobody knows if the roads and bridges are really safe to drive on and only hydrogen powered vehicles approved by them are allowed on the roads.

EDIT 6: I'm trying to respond to everyone but this is exploding... Also, I keep getting accused of ""missing"" Cardano or ""buying it high"" or something. Guys, look at my username. [I'm all about The Graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owryqy/why_the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/) (GRT).

EDIT 7: I've been reading more and being a bit more selective about commenting back since there are just too many to keep up with and every time I refresh there's 50 more, but I'm really happy to see that the comments have shifted from price to actual discussion. Great to see! This is what r/CryptoCurrency should be all about! I like ADA, I like Charles, I want it to succeed for reasons I mentioned above.

This isn't meant to be a tribalistic war-igniting trigger post. I just think it's time to have real discussion on this sub and Cardano is the hottest topic because it is leading the bullrun in gains. Stop getting so bent out of shape, my post is not going to cause Cardano to dump, nor is it an attempt to provoke a dump. I think this is a great place for newcomers and old schoolers to join one another and discuss what they know. It's also a great opportunity for Cardano followers and supporters to counter my arguments and present their points and why they believe in the project - remember, I have not really kept up with Cardano since 2017, so I can totally be wrong about a lot of things and I accept that! The point is, this thread was a success because it reminded thousands of users here that we can still engage in high level discussions and not everything has to be about price and driving lambo rockets to the moon.

Just want to thank a few posters for their great comments including  u/orangeblack07 ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vtoat?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/todayismycheatday ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vsq6t/?context=3)), u/cali_dave ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vogw9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/OhIamNotADoctor ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vnxer?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). There are so many great comments, but as you can imagine, my inbox is absolutely obliterated and I need to go to sleep lol, so give these guys the upvotes they deserve!

EDIT 8: Last edit (I hope). Some great discussion ultimately ensued and I appreciate everyone who made thoughtful posts. I definitely don't appreciate the attacks on my character and assumptions about who I am as a person, but I guess that's part of making controversial posts like this. Had no idea it would blow up so much and did my best to answer as many comments as I can. I really hope everyone knows that I do like ADA, I do like Charles, and I hope Cardano succeeds (though I think I've already mentioned this in another of my 45 edits). I was just hoping to stimulate some actual discussion on a subreddit that is in dire need of it. Thanks for engaging me. Till next time!

EDIT 14: Lots of great comments actually made me realize I don't know the first thing about what is going on with Cardano at this point in time, I'm not ashamed to admit it. There's a lot more going on than I thought there was! I listed some of the good comments that pointed me in the right direction above in EDIT 6. Maybe I'm wrong about Cardano, maybe the slow and steady wins the race philosophy will prevail! Who knows. I'm just glad that there were so many newly introduced perspectives in this thread hidden between the shill and anti-graph\_marine brigading. I'll be eagerly awaiting the launch of their smart contract platform and dApps so that I can dabble with them myself.

Thanks again to everyone who provided quality discussion and also to anyone who gave me awards, you really didn't have to do that!

tl;dr (for those who want one) - Cardano has taken a very long time to release a product while others have thrived. People only seem to talk about Cardano during bull markets when the price is going up and I want to have a discussion about how people can think it is the end-all-be-all smart contract platform when it still doesn't have a working product. Discussion ensues. Some posters create great counter arguments and provoke thoughtful discussion while others brigade me with hateful spam.",5999,2021-08-22 04:03:49,2318

>IOG is aware of the recent complaints by the SEC against Binance & Coinbase, which contain references to the organization, the Cardano network, and Cardano’s native token ADA.

>The filing contains numerous factual inaccuracies and will not impact IOG’s operations in any way. Under no circumstances is ADA a security under U.S. securities laws. It never has been. Understanding how decentralized blockchains operate is a fundamental component in creating responsible legislation. IOG continues to welcome cross-industry collaborations with regulators to help develop frameworks, which not only safeguard consumers, but do not stifle innovation within the communities building decentralized protocols. This latest filing from the SEC demonstrates that we still have a long way to go in this regard. Regulation through enforcement action does not provide either the clarity or certainty to which both the blockchain industry and consumers are entitled.

ADA,cryptocurrency,"[Serious] SOL or ADA, I’m torn between a choice of alt coins","I’ve been reading up on more and more alt coins and more and more links have been popping up from this subreddit.
But after reading a ton of posts about alts it seems so many users are holding bags or believe in ADA.

I’m trying to go 50/50 in BTC and an alt coin and I’ve been leaning more to SOL than any other alt coin but wanted to hear others because I’m worried I’ll be convincing myself without having seen the pro’s and cons of different sides.

For SOLANA i’ve mainly seen the con being the unreliability and downtime that has occurred in the past. The pro’s are fast and low transaction fees. Also setting itself up for web 3.0 and having easy setup/connection for games and web 3.0.

It seems the Solana team have some updates in the works that should (in theory) completely eliminate the risk of downtime. Would this mean the only real con of Solana is gone? Or are there a bunch of other negatives that I’m just not seeing?

Between ADA and SOL, is one better than the other? Team behind them, applications, …?

I honestly don’t know and with the amount of people seemingly more invested in ADA I thought an earnest discussion about SOL and ADA would give some insights.
I’m mainly trying to look into alt coins which are in the top 20 market cap so perhaps other alt coins that fit that criteria are some I should look into as well? These 2 are just the ones that have drawn most of my attention.

Second, it's circulating supply is huge and it's still minting coins, so it's inflationary and the price will be affected negatively. On the other side, ETH is trying to become even more deflationary.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Everyone always says “DYOR” but never shows you how to DYOR. Here’s a comprehensive guide to doing your own research in the crypto space.,"## 1) Initial information gathering and filtering

Once I identify something that looks like a good potential investment, I first go to the CoinMarketCap page for that symbol and look at the website and blockchain explorer.

- Critically evaluate the website. This is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. If it uses terms like ""Web 4.0"" or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past.

- Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. Look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc

- Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts holding or selling? Which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account?

- Read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. Try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?


## 2) Fill out an Investment Checklist

I have a checklist of questions that I find important and as I'm researching a crypto I save little snippets in Evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions:

- What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve?

- What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?

- Who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? What is the roadmap they created?

- What current product exists?

- How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?

- What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?


## 3) Create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simple

A simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do:

- Metcalfe's Law which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic.

- Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply.

- If its meant to be just used as just a currency: Take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. Most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price.

Once you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. Modeling out a valuation will lead you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action.

Once you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. This is how ""smart money"" does it.

## Think about your portfolio allocation

You should think first in broad terms how you allocate between ""safe"" and ""speculative"" cryptos. For new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily BTC and ETH. I personally consider XMR to be safe as well. A good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. As you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps.

You should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment:

- Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum
- Smart contracts platform segment - Ethereum, Polkadot, ALGO, Solana …etc
- Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash …etc
- Finance/Bank settlement segment - Stellar ...etc
- Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment -VeChain ...etc
- Promising/Innovative Tech segment: NANO, ADA, Tezos ...etc

You should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. If you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. If you are a techie who loves the technology behind a coin, invest in that.


## Think of your ""circle of competence""

This is actually a term Buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain will achieve adoption? 

This where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every category and for every type of crypto you come across. If you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well.


## Continually educate yourself about the technology and markets

If you aren't already doing it: Read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. There are decent Youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like CryptoInvestor. If you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how POS/POW works or what a DAG is or how mining actually works, learn first. If you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Charles Hoskinson was just exposed for making some statements that,"So Laura Shin, the crypto journalist, released her book, the Cryptopians, which goes into detail about founding of Ethereum, its cofounders, and uncovers the alleged identity of the Ethereum DAO hacker. In the book, we learn many things about the founders including some of their behaviors. One that I found more fascinating was Charles Hoskinson's given how drawn many are to him.

Having read the book, a twitter user calls out Laura for portraying Charles in a bad light. Hoskinson replies to the user that Laura's book is a , "" Great work of fiction. Tough market to beat George R.R. Martin and Tolkien, but we wish her well."" She then replies with some receipts, showing that Charles hasn't been very honest regarding some of his claims such as his level of education. At this point, can we trust anything Charles has to say because time and again, he's shown to not be very reliable?

Hang in there everyone, no dip lasts forever.

**Disclaimer:** This exit strategy relies on a bunch of assumptions. The point of this post is not to debate those. If you think this bullrun will last well into 2022 or perhaps even longer, that's cool, you do you. What I'm about to describe is my own exit strategy. I'm not trying to convince you that it's better than your plan, my only hope is that there might be handful of people to whom this makes sense who can take something valuable from this post. As for the rest of you, best of luck, and I sincerely mean that.

**Thesis Statement:** I believe we are at the tail end of the bullrun that started after the March Covid crash of 2020. We have seen mindblowing gains on alts like Solana, Luna, Ada, Avax, Harmony, and many others. I believe that there's not much juice left in that lemon. The main reasons for this belief are:

\- **This isn't the ""cycle of mass adoption"".** This is actually a good thing, because literally none of the L1s in the top 100 are ready for mass adoption: Solana had to shut down for 17 hours because it buckled under the weight of transactions. Eth's answer to increasing traffic is to charge you $250 in gas for a uniswap transaction. Matic can barely handle the traffic it gets currently and transactions frequently remain 'pending' for hours or days. Cardano still doesn't have working smart contracts and Hoskinson himself essentially admitted that it can't scale without L2s. I could go on here, but you get the point.

\- **Governments all around the world have been printing money like it's a sport, and that didn't begin in 2020 with the onset of the pandemic, it began more than 10 years ago after the financial crisis.** A by-product of this has been record-low interest rates. This has fueled investment all over the planet, as is easily evidenced by a completely out of control housing market in most major markets and a stock market that has been basically 'up only' for ten years straight. Governments are now admitting that the current 4%-5% inflation rate is not sustainable. In order to get this back in line, the federal banks will have to raise interest rates. That means less money for all of us, because things like mortgages, car payments, credit card debt, etc. will all go up. And obviously, it will no longer make sense to take a loan to invest (and yes, people have definitely been taking loans to invest, simply because it made sense: you can take a loan from the bank for less 5% and put that money into index funds and you'll come out on top....at least for now).

\- **This whole space is dramatically overvalued.** Yes I know, market caps do not reflect the actual value of a company, but they do reflect the current level of speculation: we are in the kind of market where Tesla is worth more than the entire German automotive industry. Cardano is worth $77 billion dollars and it currently doesn't even function as an L1 smart contract chain. Dot is worth $50 billion dollars and barely has a working product. The point is that the current valuations reflect what these projects may become in the next 5 years. In other words, their valuations are based on speculation, not current capabilities.

**""Ok dude, get to the point already""** I believe that this December will see the crypto market go absolutely ballistic, fueled by holiday spending, euphoria, and an over confidence in a market that has already seen 10X gains in the last 3 months. It will crash in early 2022, most likely kicked off by a stock market crash as governments all over the word raise interest rates and announce efforts to contain their out of control spending that's resulted in debt levels our grand children will still be paying off.

**""Cool story bro, so what are you gonna do about it?""** At some point in late December (obviously depending on market dynamics at the time), I'm going to sell most of my crypto assets for stable coins and earn yield on stable coins. The US dollar is extremely unlikely to collapse. And if it does, the whole planet goes into a massive economic recession and crypto will not be spared. USD will be the safest asset to be in, save for perhaps gold. Here's what I will do step by step:

\- Deposit stable coin as collateral on a protocol such as anchor, earning interest

\- take stable coin loan against collateral, again earning to borrow (and even if you're no longer getting paid to borrow, the interest earned from lending will most likely outweigh the interest owed from borrowing, meaning on a net level, you're still making money)

\- Provide stable coin liquidity, e.g. USDC <> DAI pair, earning yield and compounding that yield into liquidity.

The rates currently available for doing this vary from platform to platform, but at the moment, you can easily get 20% APR doing this. If you're willing to risk doing this with smaller, less established platforms like Tranquil and Openswap on Harmony, you can get almost 100% APR). There are variations of the above, but that's the general gist.

**""And then what?""** I wait as my USD reserves grow. I use the time to research in an effort to identify alts that have a good chance of becoming winners in the next bull market. My focus will be on L1s that can actually scale to global demand without having to rely on imperfect L2 solutions. Once it becomes relatively clear that the market has reached the bottom (where it will probably stay for quite some time like it has in every other true bear market), I start to DCA, positioning myself for the next bull market, whether that comes in late 2022 or in 2024, I plan on being a part of it.

Thanks to those who read this entire wall of text, and to those who didn't, well, you're not reading this anyway ;)

**EDIT:** A few responses are misinterpreting the above as trying to 'time the market'. I wouldn't really call it that. If I was trying to time the market, I'd be trying to sell more or less the exact top. I know I won't be able to do that, and I'm not at all ruling out that after I sell, the market keeps pumping throughout January and maybe even longer. But I'm absolutely willing to forego gains at the very tail end of the market if it means not having to see my portfolio bleed like a slasher movie over the course of a few short days like it did in 2018.",3725,2021-11-09 20:34:19,3015
ADA,cryptocurrency,"I've been on this sub for around a week, now I understand why people lose money when they follow people's advice on here","Yesterday i made a post about scam coins with no real value. I expected to see common sense and critical thinking, criticism against shitcoins.
Unfortunately what I saw was universal love for shitcoins, how people see them as their winning lottery tickets. What's 20$, if it moons I will win a lot, if it gets rugpulled I lose only 20$.

Everyone here screams adoption this adoption that, but nobody realizes that every time they support a scam coin they don't only lose money, they take a giant shit on crypto's credibility.

You're wondering why your parents think crypto is a ponzi, while you put yet another 50$ on a rugpull doge clone. Maybe you're a part of the problem mate.

Yes scams will happen always but when the hive mentality ""its only 20/50$"" still exists, crypto will never be taken seriously and adopted at large.

Scams coins aren't gonna stop existing until the demand of them is non existant. And it's not a big amount but if 3.5mil people start using their brains and not their get overwhelmed by their ""where lambo"" mentality things might get a little bit better.

Stop spending your money in shitcoins and DYOR. Don't make exploiters rich. Be the better person.

ADA,cryptocurrency,"[SERIOUS] What would you consider the biggest concerns with your favourite coins? DOT, ATOM, LINK, ADA, MATIC, NEAR, etc. I would love to hear healthy constructive criticism OR reasons why you didn’t invest into certain projects.","We read a lot of the talking points and pros of various coins all the time. Some communities are still going strong and this can sometimes lead to tribalism. Dedicated coin shillers are everywhere. To play devil’s advocate, I want to hear more of the setbacks, concerns, or flaws in the coin’s tech that you believe potential new investors should know.



This sub loves to hate on certain projects, sometimes with good reason, but for the purpose of this discussion, please exclude SOL, DOGE, as well as existing failed projects that were already rug-pulled. Also if you are a BTC maxi, you don’t need to comment how you avoid all alts like the plague.



The tokenomics of certain coins seem to torpedo their future success, with very little released early on, followed by excessive dumping on retail for years later. It’s things like this that I sometimes only catch in discussions when early adopters defend their coin “Well yeah, you should have read that, blah blah, blah”.



So, what’s off-putting to you about certain coins?",31,2022-11-30 22:09:16,159
ADA,cryptocurrency,Time to step up and protect this community.,"Given the events of the past week with Doge and XRP pump and dumps it’s clear that we need to protect people within this community. Some have been in this space for a lot longer than others and there’s been plenty of examples of scams throughout the years and plenty people scammed with them. 

The Doge pump last week angered me and you could see people getting excited and the inevitable was going to happen. A lot of new people got sucked into the prospect of quick, easy money and calls for calm fell on deaf ears.

Then the same with XRP. I had friends calling me about it and asking advice and I told them exactly what I thought was going on, which transpired to be the case.  Lucky they took my advice and held off. 

There’s been a significant rise in new accounts shilling these days and it’s our responsibility to help ease new investors into the space. It’s frustrating watching the endless shill. Is there anything else that can be done to protect this space? Scamming people doesn’t bode well for the future of this society.",6875,2021-02-02 08:23:29,1334

ADA,cryptocurrency,I don't think $10 per ADA by EOY is reasonable.,"I saw a big influencer with 473k followers tweeted that it's very possible for ADA to reach $10 by EOY. But as someone who holds this coin for almost a year without selling I doubt this would happen.

It's been stagnant and its ATH was only $3.09. It'll take A LOT of money to move it to $10. There have been so many FUDs as well and honestly I just don't see it hitting that high by EOY. Anyone's willing to give their insights?

I also want to say, things are progressing very slowly on Cardano network. BNB and SOL seem to have more... I don't know... Backup, funding, support, money flowing in than Cardano.

Tho, obviously, I'm the first person who'll get SO EXCITED if it ever hits $10.",91,2021-11-08 09:04:16,194
ADA,cryptocurrency,A Beginner's Guide to Cryptocurrency Wallets,"A cryptocurrency wallet is basically a software that enables you to track, send and receive coins through the blockchain like a bank account. Every wallet has a public key and a private key, but we'll get back to this later. But first...

# Why do you need a wallet?

There's an old saying in Tennessee that says: **""Not your keys, not your coins.""** What it actually means is that if you keep your cryptocurrencies on an exchange (such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken), you don't actually own those coins, because you don't have the keys to the related wallet. You gain access to those wallets by logging into these exchanges, but your account can - theoretically - be deleted in the blink of an eye, or the exchange can get hacked, attacked, etc. And with it, your funds can disappear forever. If you want to learn more about this, make sure to look up Mt. Gox's hacking. It is an unfortunate event, but one that puts you on guard. 

So you already know that you need to own your keys in order to own your coins. **But what are these keys?**

Your **public key** is what identifies your account on the network. Think of it as your email address, because when someone wants to send you cryptocurrency, they will send it to this address. 

Your **private key** is a string of 64 characters that can be generated from a 12-word seed phrase. It basically serves as the password of your account. It is used to sign transactions and to prove that you own the related public key. 

See, it's not that complicated, is it?

# About wallet types

There are 4 types of wallets that you should be using. Ideally, you can pick the one that fits your crypto habits the most. You should avoid using Web wallets. As always, if you can, please pick the safest wallet type in order to minimize the risk of losing your cryptos. 

**Hardware / Offline / Cold Wallet** \- an offline storage device (e.g. hard disk, USB stick). You might've heard the names Ledger or Trezor, these are the 2 biggest brands at the moment. The ledger supports over 1200 cryptocurrencies, while Trezor supports over a thousand. It is also the most secure way to store your cryptocurrencies. 

**Mobile Wallet** \- applications that are installable on your mobile phone. Beware that even though an app can hold crypto, it doesn't mean it is NOT custodial. (e.g. Coinbase has a mobile app, but it is custodial, meaning that they control your coins.) Exodus or Atomic mobile apps are recommended if you decide to create a mobile wallet.

**Desktop Wallet** \- wallets that are installable on different desktops and are compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. Your keys are stored on your computer, and you can use this wallet even when you're offline. Note: Desktop wallets tend to be more advanced than mobile wallets, and usually come with more technically complicated features that can increase privacy or allow for more flexibility when it comes to signing transactions.

**Paper wallet** \- a paper wallet is essentially a piece of paper including your public and private key, or a QR code (so that you can quickly scan them and add the keys to a software wallet to make a transaction). It's a really safe way to store your cryptos because your keys are not connected to any servers. The only way someone can steal your cryptos is if they steal this paper.

# The Best Hardware Wallets

**Ledger Nano (S and X)** \- The most popular hardware wallet brand in the world, currently sells 2 different sticks. The S is the cheaper alternative, but if you handle transactions between multiple cryptocurrencies frequently, the larger storage of the Nano X should be more convenient. The Nano X also has Bluetooth 5.0 support. You can read more about Ledgers on their website. 

Beware that **Ledger was targeted by a cyberattack that led to a data breach** in July 2020. A larger subset of detailed information has been leaked, approximately 272,000 detailed information such as postal address, last name, first name, and telephone number of our customers. However, not a single coin was stolen as hackers didn't gain access to private keys. Please keep this in mind when making your decision. 

**Trezor (One and Model T)** \- Trezor is the other popular hardware wallet brand. The Trezor One is the cheaper alternative ($59), while the Model T is more expensive but comes with extended functionality and additionally supports cryptocurrencies such as ADA, XMR, XTZ, etc.

Despite the security of hardware devices themselves, **the weakest link is always the people using them.** If possible, avoid buying used hardware wallets, even though both Trezor and Ledger have security measures to avoid the attempt of installing malwares.

# The Best Desktop Wallets

**Exodus** \- a very user-friendly and easy to understand, reliable wallet. As of now, it is probably the most popular desktop wallet. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux as well. 

**Atomic** \- it is also a user-friendly and reliable wallet. Atomic supports 500+ assets and allows staking various cryptocurrencies. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Of course, there are several other reliable desktop wallets, but these two proved to be the most user-friendly and easy to use wallets so far. As always, please DYOR!

**If you decide to go with a mobile wallet** (instead of a paper, hardware, or a desktop wallet), Exodus or Atomic are both available on iOS and Android. Please avoid installing 10+ crypto wallet applications on your phone, because you'll make it impossible to keep track of your keys and passwords eventually.

Last piece of advice: always be cautious and double-check everything. Keep your devices malware-free, and don't click on anything suspicious (such as emails from ""Binnance"", crazy bonus links from ""Coimbase"", etc.)

ADA,cryptocurrency,In defense of ADA from someone who owns none of it,"Disclaimer. I am 100% in on Nano and have been for some time. I have never owned a single ADA or many platform coins for that matter.

I remember back in 2017 when ADA rose from a mid tier coin to the top 20. It was immediately coined a vapor ware coin that had no value. However, ADA did not fall back when hit with this label. Instead, it stayed in the top twenty and in fact rose to the top ten where it remained for years.  Now, it has rose to the top five amongst the progress that it has made.

May coins have been in the top ten over the years that claimed to be game changers and they have all collapsed. These include IOTA, EOS, BCH, NEO, ect. Others that have no claim to be game changers are Doge.

Say what you want about ADA but it has defied the claims of it having no value by being in the top ten foe years when many others have failed.

Edit: I think alot of the hate is due to tribalism. People held other Ethereum killers such as EOS, NEO, NEM, COSMOS, Tezos, ect. When another coin rises that was not theirs the best explanation is that the other coin is a scam. This way you can avoid the thought that your coin may not win. I had a similar story in 2017 and owned Walton(Yikes). Everyone in Walton thought that VeChain was a scam because it was gaining traction and had some different approaches with marketing. 

A lot of people refused to buy VeChain because it was a ""scam"" and any research that proved otherwise was dismissed as shilling or ""coordinated fud."" However, years later Walton is long dead, and for good reason. While VeChain is probing to not be a scam",101,2021-08-22 23:19:14,197
ADA,cryptocurrency,APEcoin is down more than 20% in a day. This might be your last warning before the real dumping starts.,"Apecoin reached $2Billion market cap in a single day with no utility or use case. It's price is inflated as fuck. All the people who invested in that shitcoin know this. But they still invested in it because of the hype and the gambler instinct. 

Everyone knows that project gonna dump hard and it's not in the far future.. 

You might as well consider that recent dump as a warning before the actual storm starts. 

Holding bags of a shitcoin called Ape is not a good image at all. You don't want to be called as a ApeCoin bags hodler.

ADA,cryptocurrency,The ultimate guide to earning passive income with cryptocurrencies 📌,"Most of us are here to make money. Some people try trading, while others just HODL and check the prices every 5 minutes. And even though many of us have made decent amounts, neither of these two ways can guarantee a reliable source of income.

But what if I told you that apart from trading and holding, there are other ways that can make you money in the crypto space? Well, in this guide I have collected most of these methods so that you can pick out the ones you prefer, and start earning passive income with crypto.

# #1 - Staking

Staking is an activity where a user locks or holds his funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to participate in maintaining the operations of a proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain system. It is similar to crypto mining in the sense that it helps a network achieve consensus while rewarding users who participate.

Staking can be an excellent way to increase your cryptocurrency holdings with minimal effort. You can stake various cryptocurrencies such as DOT, ADA, AVAX etc. By doing this, you earn a certain APY (annual percentage yield), usually between 4%-25% depending on how long you are willing to lock your cryptos.

You can either stake a coin from a wallet such as Exodus, or you can stake your coins on a few exchanges (e.g. Binance). As always, DYOR before locking your crypto for 30-60-90 or more days.

# #2 - Airdrops

An airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. Small amounts of the new virtual currency are sent to the wallets of active members of the blockchain community for free or in return for a small service, such as retweeting a post sent by the company issuing the currency.

The famous Uniswap airdrop made 49 million UNI claimable for users whose address has ever called the Uniswap v1 or v2 contracts. Each address could claim 400 UNI (worth ≈ $7400), which is a nice sum for doing almost nothing.

It is worth keeping an eye out for possible future airdrops, so make sure to follow the news! :)

# #3 - Reddit Moons

Most of the users here already know, but for those who don't (and with a large influx of new members, it's possibly a lot of you guys), you can earn Moons for upvotes on this subreddit. But what are Moons?

""Moons exist as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, where they are managed by a suite of smart contracts that handle balances, transfers, distribution/claiming, and purchasing Special Memberships. The smart contracts and mobile apps have been reviewed and audited by Trail of Bits, an independent security firm with blockchain expertise.

As blockchain tokens, Moons are independent of Reddit. Once you’ve earned them, neither Reddit nor moderators can take your Moons away or decide what you do with them. They’re all yours.""

In order to be able to claim your Moons, you'll need to download the Reddit mobile app and set up your vault (click on your icon at the top left of the home page).

The main purpose for moons is to own a share of the community (vote on governance/distribution proposals) as well as redeem them for the premium membership, which allows you to change the color of your username, embed gifs in comments, add custom flair, etc.

To sum it up, you earn Moons by commenting and posting - something that you'd normally do anyway. Just don't forget to create your vault!

In case you want to, you have the option to sell your Moons. The current price of Moons is $0.071380 / coin (15/02/2021), and you can only sell your moons on Honeyswap at the moment.

# #4 - Nexo, Celsius, etc.

This method is very similar to what banks offer on your investment, except that on Nexo and Celsius you can earn up to 6-14% just by keeping your crypto, stablecoin or fiat on their site.

While the saying ""not your keys, not your coins"" is true, these companies are insured and have never been hacked before. As far as I know, both of these sites have a daily payout system, and you can deposit and withdraw funds whenever you want to.

If you choose this method, it might be worth splitting your investment between these sites in order to prepare for the worst and also to be able to claim offers and bonuses on both sites once available.

# #5 - Coinbase Earn

Not a ""passive"" method, but I felt like I should add this one to the list. Many of you are already familiar with the ""It ain't much, but it's honest work"" meme referring to Coinbase Earn, a program where you can earn a few coins by watching educational videos of certain cryptocurrencies and solving the quizzes that follow said videos.

In my country, currently Graph, Compound, XLM, CELO, Band, and Maker are available through Coinbase Earn, and if you complete all of these crypto's quizzes, you can earn up to $30-$40. In crypto, of course.

Compared to the previous methods, it truly ain't much, but it's honest work, and who knows how these coins will perform in the upcoming years. Worth a shot!

ADA,cryptocurrency,WTF going on with ETH & Ada - weird staking ads... ,"A while ago I got an advertisement on Ig, from the profile: @Charleshoskinson.cardano about a staking ""opportunity"" 2% daily reward. There's no direct link, just profile visit CTA, on the profiles story you can see and click on the link which redirects to cardanostake.org

Today I got an advertisement from the profile: @founder.ethereum, same design litteraly font, style, everything, you can check it out by yourself.
Same 2% daily...
Website is etherstaking.org., which is literally the same design as the cardano one...

Both profiles got verified in August 2024.

I tried checking out on the web about the ongoing scam or something, wasn't successful in finding out the specific one... 

Issue here is that the both profiles got verified by the Instagram (Meta), you can't get or pay the verification that easy, kinda... You gotta do a KYC n stuff. But it is doable I guess to execute a fraudulent verification successfully...

So long story short I am uncertain with the legitimacy of the profiles, websites, staking rewards. Looks to me like a scam, but a quite weird one. 

What's your opinion? Has anyone else encounter such ads on Meta or other platforms? ",0,2024-09-04 13:19:36,29

I didn't buy a car and biked to work to save money. I remember at the time thinking there was about a 1/3 chance it would 100x, so there was an asymmetrical risk/reward in my opinion. 

Sold a large chunk during the previous bull run in 2017, and sold the remaining in multiple sales this January. Averaged about a 150x on my cost basis across all sales. All long-term capital gains. Now I'm 27 and financially independent. Will be buying my parents a house this year.

ADA,cryptocurrency,"Doge may be a memecoin, but it brought me to this community and made me invest in other crypto.","Back in february when the whole GME hype started, I saw a couple threads popping up that the Dogecoin comminity is planning to rise as well. It was too late for me to invest in GME as it already spiked, so I tried my luck with Doge and bought at 0.05€ for 50€. Not to be too risky with my first investment ever... 2 months later I cashed out (a bit too early) and made about 180€. So my total wallet was now €230, which I planned to invest in Doge again once the price dropped. 

Luckily the price stayed up and I realized that if I'd put my money back in Doge, I would only lose. Either the price stays up and I end up with less doge than I initially had or I buy when the price drops and end up with less € if it continues to drop. 

So I started looking for alternatives to invest my winnings. I searched for other ""cheap"" coins, that had a lot of potential to grow, by reading this subreddit and came across VET and ADA.  I gained some confidence by profiting from the doge investment and deposited another €500 into my wallet. I put €300 into VET and 350€ into ADA. I might put the remaining €80 back into Doge. It's an unpredictable meme after all, so who knows what happens. 

I'm planning to create a more diverse portfolio if my current investment works somewhat out.

Cardano (ADA) ranks as top crypto protocol by development activity in 2022

Most of the cryptocurrency industry is still struggling to recover its value from the consequences of the FTX collapse, finalizing one of the worst years in the sector’s history, but Cardano (ADA) is making strides in the department of development activity.

Indeed, Cardano has been ranked as the top blockchain protocol by development activity in 2022, followed by Polkadot (DOT) and Cosmos (ATOM), according to the list published by the on-chain and social metrics platform Santiment on December 30

The development activity rates of the Cardano team during the entire year of 2022 were the highest among all the observed protocols, although, in terms of its return on investment (ROI) since the token sale, ADA has ranked sixth.

For Cardano, the recent results are a confirmation of its previous success, taking into account that the development activity rates in its public GitHub repositories in November were 18% higher than the next highest-ranked asset, recording 572.67 generated events.

On top of that, Cardano’s key network activities have recorded significant growth in 2022, with its smart contract feature accounting for a growth rate of 394% compared to 2021, hitting the milestone of 4,445 contracts as of December 16.

At the same time, native tokens on the platform increased 192%, hitting the 7.3 million mark, as the transactions on Cardano surged 139% to 56.9 million, the number of wallets surpassing 3.8 million – a growth of 47% compared to the year before.

Ada is actually a small town in Ohio where Ohio Northern University is located, home of the Polar Bears. They’re most well known for studying engineering and pharmacy. It’s a small private university where a year probably costs close to 50k per year so be prepared to sell an arm, a leg, and your soul to attend there if you don’t have a good scholarship or a trust fund.

Nearest major down is Lima. If you haven’t heard of Lima, you’re probably not familiar with Ohio. If you haven’t heard of Ohio, you probably aren’t from the states. Ohio is in the Midwest region. When I say Midwest I actually mean the mid-east when looking at the country as a whole on the map, but we call it the Midwest because geography is stupid.

ADA,cryptocurrency,Charles Hoskinson is a terrible person and his ADA coin will go to zero,"If you hold ADA or are considering it, please read this info about the founder of ADA. 

Have you ever looked up Charles Hoskinson's history in crypto? Have you ever read up on what people who know him best have said about him? He's currently a leading face in crypto, more specifically ADA, but he's a terrible person who's in crypto for no one but himself. Here's a brief history of how he got to where he is:

In 2013, Charles met Vitalik Buterin. He heard Vitalik's idea for a Turing-complete global computer (ETH) and saw an opportunity to get rich. He forced himself into the project and LITERALLY proclaimed himself CEO and co-founder without doing anything of value. Vitalik was a nice, impressionable 19 year old so he didn't stop Charles. 

Months later, Charles was BOOTED off the Ethereum project. He likes to say he voluntary left because of disagreements over what direction to go in. That's a flat out lie. He quite literally begged and bargained to stay on. He cared less about staying on once he found out that his founder's share of Ethereum was still secure even though he was being voted off the project by people who couldn't stand him. He was living with the other founders who were staying in Zug, Switzerland, deciding what organization to start ETH as. According to the other ETH founders who worked near him (not *with* him, because Charles did nothing except piss other people off and call up news organizations to interview him about ETH), here are a few things that he did while acting as self-proclaimed CEO of the project:

\- Charles voted to have Ethereum be a for-profit organization with a pre-mine and founder's shares. He also wanted the ETH code to be closed-source. Vitalik, being the decent man and idealist, objected to this. He said he wanted open-source code, decentralization, and for ETH to be a fair launch like Bitcoin, and to organize into a non-profit. Charles quite literally LIED to the group of founders saying he looked into it and in Switzerland it was nearly impossible to become a non-profit while incorporating into a for-profit is very easy. In reality, the opposite is true. He only acted in self interest.

\- Charles acted like an absolute creep and incel when it came to women. He showed his coworkers a \*pitcure\* of a text message writing ""I want to suck your dick."" He claimed it was from a woman to him. The other founders were like, ""why tf are you showing this to me?"" The founder's team assistant, Roxy, said she was absolutely creeped out by him and she was happy to see him kicked off.

\- Charles lied about military service to his coworkers. He claimed several times to have worked in DARPA, or that he was a CIA agent, or flew HALO missions in Afghanistan. He claimed to have met many servicewomen who made love to him. All not true.

\- Charles claimed to have voluntarily left his previous job at BitShares. Kinda like how he ""voluntarily"" left Ethereum. In reality, he was forced out because of sexual assault allegations from a female co-worker. 

\- Charles claimed to be Satoshi to the other founders of Ethereum. He conjured fake documents and back-dated fake emails to support his wild, out-of-nowhere claims to be Satoshi. All the other founders thought he was an absolute sociopath.

\- When in Zug, all the other founders who were actually working had to sleep on mattresses on the ground in the living room. He claimed the one and only bedroom for himself and was alone in there doing nothing while others were coding, etc. He would frequently disrupt others by talking about how he was gonna make millions off of ETH and what sports cars he should buy.

Charles was eventually voted off the project by Vitalik and other founders at a board meeting. He hurt the project severely and was constantly risking the project's image. He added nothing of value. His founder's share of Ethereum is worth over $500 million dollars.

Soon after he was kicked off, and with Ether's successful crowdfunding sale, he saw the opportunity for massive wealth. He went and started IOHK and Cardano (ADA). Not because he had a different vision of a decentralized smart application platform, but because he wanted more money. In fact, he knows nothing about coding or cryptocurrency in general. He just wants to be rich and famous.

He basically copied the entire idea of Ethereum and gave it a different consensus mechanism. There is nothing of serious value that ADA brings. It's copy and paste with a different logo, pre-mine, give the founder billions because why not. And you wanna know the worst part? It worked. He's worth billions of dollars from scamming other people.

Under Charles' leadership, I can't imagine ADA being around long-term, or ever catching up to Ethereum for that matter. Please let me know if there's something I missed in this post.

ADA,cryptocurrency,is Cardano dead? ADA," If history is any indication, Cardano is far from being dead. It is true that during the bear market of 2022, Cardano (ADA), along with most other crypto assets, saw an extreme drop in its value – ADA is changing hands 90% removed from its all-time high, controlling a $10.6 billion market share as of press time. Despite the recent poor market performance, there are several reasons to be optimistic about Cardano’s future.

Just as a quick aside, here’s a brief reminder of how quickly things can change in crypto – Cardano entered the 2021 bull season with a price of $0.10 and a market value of $3.31B. During the historic bull market, ADA gained a total of 3000% in value, reaching an ATH price of $3.10 and a market capitalization of $94.75B. 

It is totally understandable that numerous investors are asking the “Is Cardano dead?” question in light of the recent activity in the cryptocurrency market. However, we must remember that despite the massive value reduction, the ADA token is still worth over 75% more than at the start of the 2021 bull market run. 
The changing global monetary system, investments of large companies in crypto, and the increasing adoption of crypto around the globe indicate that the negative market trend is bound to reverse in due time. However, at the moment, it seems that it could take months or even years before we see Cardano retesting its previous ATH.",9,2023-07-21 07:15:54,88

It will keep rising till the launch on 12th September and then it will dip a bit. 

Price prediction - $3.1 by next week

Current Price - $2.91

Cardano began as the third generation blockchain network. In comparison, Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered to belong to the first and second generations of blockchain technology. It aims to compete with Ethereum by being a more secure, scalable, and efficient network. However, Cardano is trying to achieve what Ethereum has done consistently for a long time.

While investors have turned their focus and attention to ADA in a big way, there are still some questions on whether it has the potential to repeat the success of Ethereum.


Cardano vs Ethereum

The network that Cardano hopes to emulate and surpass is Ethereum. That is because Ethereum supports decentralized apps, DeFi, NFT and smart contracts. It is something that Cardano also promises to do, and in a better way.

The Cardano network works on “proof of stake” unlike Ethereum’s “proof of work.” When a miner tries to validate a Cardano transaction, they have to show the coins they hold as proof of stake. In the case of Ethereum, a miner has to validate the transaction through proof of work which involves working out a puzzle, which takes more time and consumes more energy.",49,2021-08-29 11:08:15,178

ADA,cryptocurrency,Why all the ADA hate?,"I first bought into ADA a few months ago, and since then the price has taken a huge hit. Looking at this sub, there seems to be a lot of sentiment that the price hit is deserved. I really don't understand why. 

I'm definitely not a crypto expert, but there has been some good news for Cardano recently. The Alonzo Hard Fork implemented smart contract capability, allowing functionality that has never been seen on the Cardano blockchain before. Huge projects are already in the testing phase preparing to roll out (ErgoDex, Meld, SundaeSwap, and more). The DPoS consensus mechanism has proved an invaluable way for new projects to get their start, as Initial Stake Pool Offerings allow users to get exposure to and support new projects without actually risking their tokens. (Still DYOR when delegating to a stake pool of course; you could lose your staking rewards)

In the past few months, Cardano has transformed itself from a store of value to a DApp ecosystem, and yet still the price has continued to fall. I'm feeling baffled, befuddled, and, quite possibly, bamboozled. What is going on with the price? What are your feelings on Cardano? What are the negatives sides to it?

ADA,cryptocurrency,This is why I continue to hold ADA. Data is your friend.,"I'm going to show some data charts to Illustrate why ADA is doing well even though the price action (market chart) says other wise. On-chain metrics are the most data of any token; more important than the price of said token.

To clarify for the following pie chart: whales (wallets with more than 1% of total circulating supply), investors (wallets that have between 0,1% and 1% of total circulating supply) and retail (wallets that have less than 0,1% of the total circulating supply)

Here I'm comparing holders of ETH and ADA, as ETH is the closest token to ADA.

So here is the chart from ADA

[ Whales: 6&#37;. Investors: 22&#37;. Retail: 72&#37; ](https://preview.redd.it/eajfv6goet081.png?width=1466&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e37ad9697ee76155fcfe1ef37b6502785473da6)

And for a comparison, I'm going to show ETH stats.

[ Whales: 21&#37;. Investors 20&#37;. Retail: 59&#37; ](https://preview.redd.it/6xk2uz4ret081.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f4dfb9fa9cdf2b64629770a16f93c565d080c77)

Comparing the holders of ADA and ETH it's interesting that the number of Investors are the same, while ADA has 70% less whales holding the token. In addition, the market cap of ADA is 12% the market cap of ETH (ETH : 523bn. ADA : 62bn).

Now if we compare the ratio of market cap to the ratio of whales we get:

* ADA market cap / ETH market cap = 62/523 = 0.12
* ADA whales / ETH whales = 6/21 = 0.29

This I believe is bullish because whale ratio is higher than market cap ratio by 240%, which means there are more whales for a relatively smaller market cap project. This is my interpretation of this data so take it with a grain of salt ,and there are various ways of interpreting this.

&#x200B;

Now lets look at **long term holders** (holding for more than 1 year+) and the number of these addresses

[ May 2.78b ADA. Oct 6.34b ADA. Nov \(month not over\) 6.63b ADA ](https://preview.redd.it/k9xxevowet081.png?width=1505&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ac0e053c1fe0b9d35dc4c15de63d3c473802a6d)

As we can see whales have been accumulating for the past 7 months, with an increase in 245% owned by whales. In addition, the number of addresses have gone from 167k to 258k, meaning more whales are coming into ADA. Both of these signals are bullish.

You can start a 7 day trial with no credit card requirement, unlike some other sites. There are other sites to access this data as well. I'm not affiliated with Intotheblock, but it's the best site I've found for free data)

**In conclusion or TL;DR**: ADA has strong on-chain metrics, so don't be fouled by the 40% drop since ATH. ADA takes time to consolidate after massive rallies, like the one in august, the one from december 2020 to March 2021 and the one from March 2020 to August 2020. In the crypto market patience is one of the most valuable assets.

Note: I currently hold ADA.

&#x200B;

**Edit**: I see there is a lot of hate on ADA and that's fine, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. One thing I think a lot of people don't have clear is that Cardano is a peer reviewed project, so things take longer to launch, but have a high chance of success when they are launched. Also, if you think this ecosystem doesn't mean anything, then by all means, hate on the token.

ADA,CryptoMarkets,Cardano has done surprisingly well in troubled waters,"The last few days have seen significant flux in the crypto market. Elon declared an end to the “buy a Tesla with Bitcoin” stunt. Binance landed in deep water with regulators in the US. Coinbase continued to underperform against expectations in the stock market. Most coins and tokens trended down.

It is interesting how Cardano has flowed through this mess appreciating rather than decreasing in value. This is probably due to two simple things. One, it’s not Bitcoin, so it’s not in the primary spotlight of negative news. Two, it’s got perhaps the most momentum of third generation blockchains, and that makes it an easy hedge for those concerned with point one.

However, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. ADA is probably overpriced right now, riding on a halo due to low interest capital, crypto hype, and the primary market option floundering. A re-pricing will probably occur, I would suggest alongside ETH, as both have surged far ahead of their internal market growth. By that, I mean ahead of the smart contracts or profitable tokens, or practical global deployments matching the scaling of the token price.

These are heady times. It is a perfect moment to keep your hat firmly attached, stick to your long term plans, and not get distracted.

== Additional Note ==

I’m bullish about the long term, but I suspect we will have a jolt in the short term as peak crypto 2021 passes. It’s important to remember than the last time that happened, Cardano went from $1.0085 on January 1st 2018 to $0.1508 on March 26th 2018. In the latter part of the year it was trading in the 2 to 4 cent level with spikes to around 8 cent until April 2020, when it started the current upward trend, significantly accelerating in 2021. I don’t expect as dramatic a repricing this time because the fundamentals have improved. Nevertheless… one should reread the paragraph above if one finds oneself getting too excited.",466,2021-05-14 17:41:20,142

ADA,CryptoMarkets,Not all Cardano members are intelligent ,"Short Story: I was scammed successfully for 4k of my ADA savings.

Long Story: So, yesterday was a complete disaster. I lost 4.000 ADA to a scam, and I feel like such an idiot. Here's how it went down.

I got this email that looked super legit, saying I needed to authorize my connection. It seemed like it was from a site I trusted, so I didn't even think to check the email address. They didn't ask for anything suspicious, which made it seem even more legit.

There was a link and thinking I was just renewing my connection, I clicked the link. It even showed my own IP address, so I didn't think twice.

I followed the steps to authorize the connection, and everything seemed fine. But later, when I checked my wallet, all my ADA was gone. Just like that.

I searched online and found out this is a new scam, because there wasn't much info about it yet. Now I feel incredibly stupid and naive. I hope by sharing my story, others can avoid making the same mistake. Always double-check email addresses and be extra cautious with urgent notifications.

This all went down yesterday, and I'm still in shock. I'm not even sure what to do next. I'm definitely switch to a wallet recommended by Cardano. Seriously, everyone, be careful. I don't want anyone else to go through what I did. Fucking stupid, I know, but maybe this will save someone else from falling for it.

PS: I asked ChatGPT to write this because I don't write that well in english

I got a new wallet with 0 ADA on VESPR and it will take ages to get back where I was yesterday. I am a student so if someone would like to donate it would be appreciated

I'm facing some losses and would appreciate any donations to help cover them. Thank you.

ADA,CryptoMarkets,"Cardano Surges 1,218% in Key Metric — Will ADA Price Follow Suit?","
According to on-chain transaction data, Cardano whales have been largely absent since early July, coinciding with [ADA](https://blog.nanovest.io/berita/cardano-mengalami-lonjakan-1-218-pada-metrik-utama-ini-akankah-harga-ada-mengikuti-10402/) price consolidation. Since late June, daily inflows into ADA whales have remained below 5 million, except for a small spike at the beginning of the week.

Specifically, IntoTheBlock's on-chain data reveals a 1,218% increase in daily inflows to whale wallets recently, potentially indicating an impending rise in ADA price.

Cardano Experiences 1,218% Surge in Key Metric

As mentioned earlier, daily inflows into whale wallets have declined since July 5th. However, spurred by increased activity early in the week, inflows into whale wallets surged by 1,218%, with ADA jumping from 14.51 million on July 8th to 110.82 million on July 9th. This increase surpasses previous spikes of 1,218%.

The metric of Large Holders Inflow tracks how many ADA tokens flow into wallets holding at least 0.1% of the circulating ADA supply. According to Coinmarketcap data, each wallet tracked by this metric must hold at least 35.87 million ADA tokens to be considered a whale or large holder.

According to ADA distribution, only 0.01% of all Cardano addresses hold between 10 million to 100 million ADA tokens. However, they control a significant portion (36.26%) of the circulating coins, giving them influence over overall price movements.

Will ADA Price Follow?

Whale activity not only directly impacts prices but also affects overall market sentiment. When these major players move, it can boost confidence or spread fear among other whales and retail investors.

ADA recently hit a nine-month low of $0.3211 due to bearish sentiment but has since recovered and is now approaching positive levels over the past seven days. ADA has risen by 2.25% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.3936 at the time of writing.

ADA has lost its cup and handle formation on the price chart due to this short-term price increase. Ultimately, this could lead to a 70% price increase above the $1 threshold.

On the development side, Cardano's blockchain, once considered dormant, is poised to expand its network.

In summary, Cardano's recent surge in whale inflows suggests potential positive momentum for ADA's price. However, market conditions and whale behavior will ultimately dictate whether ADA can sustain and build upon this upward movement.

There are striking similarities in the Charts and Price action.  
Also Cardano ADA Staking rewards are also something to consider for long term investors and locking the supply of available coins in circulation. Effectively putting pressure on Price in Upward Direction.  
Will this porve to be true Ethereum Killer? There are a lot of expectations building up with the Project.

ADA,CryptoMarkets,An unbiased opinion on Cardano?," 

I have some money in it - 'blocked' as I like to say because I didn't sell at 3$ and saw around of 70% of my profit vanish. Someone gave me a tip to invest money in it, and for a mere year I was happy seeing my investment grow, but I did not know when to sell - did not have any technical analysis knowledge...so I did not notice those mf 1 week candlesticks surfing the 2 standard deviation bollinger.. . So yeah, roughly 70% down from ath, something all Cardano holders are experiencing. Lately I've been doing extensive research on investing and I wanna shift from passive crypto holding to active stock/options /other derivative investing, but I am not sure if it is the right moment to get out of my position. I believe Ada hit the floor and it won't go lower. But will it go back up again?

However, much of my former ADA bullish-ness came from a rudimentary understanding of the project. I'm not a geek nor a blockchain enthusiast, so my understanding of the way Cardano is developing is rather simplistic. I know that the whole idea around this blockchain is about ""slowly but surely"" improvements, so instead of jumping onto popular demands and features, they prefer to do things right. I am, however, beginning to doubt the project itself. I do not know what they are doing from a technical standpoint - although I keep seeing that it is getting outclassed by other projects like Avalanche, Solana, etc- , but as an investor I cannot notice that this is Cardano's 7th straight red month, so it keeps me wondering if the time to move forward has come.

I honestly do not care about the project, my goal is to achieve maximum profit, but I can't help being a little bit bullish on Cardano, given the fact I've witnessed it's spectacular rise ( and fall). So I'm looking for some unbiased, objective thoughts on ADA and it's possible price movements. Please, I'm sick of those specific Cardano-hater ""ada is shit and will go to zero"". The fanboy ""ada is the best blockchain and holders will rule the world"" falls in the same category for me. I do not like Cardano, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana etc. But I like the possibility of earning profit from investing in them. So please, keep this thread financially-oriented, as much as possible.",1,2022-03-19 19:04:59,25

""Cardano's network is exactly where it should be, prioritizing security over speed to market. It's always been the measure twice cut once blockchain which is why so many have been interested in this project since it launched.

Cardano Launches Vasil on Testnet: Why is This Crucial?

Cardano’s Vasil upgrade is a major part of the Basho era, which comes as stage four among five big upgrades awaiting the Cardano network. In Cardano, Byron (phase 1) was mainly responsible to provide a robust foundation to the network; Shelley (phase 2) focused on decentralization; Goguen (phase 3) implemented smart contract functionality; whereas Basho (the current phase 4) is set to guarantee maximum scalability.

As stated by IOG, the community has to be “comfortable and ready” before the new upgrade goes live on the mainnet.

The Cardano team will monitor the network performance just as the consensus enters the Basho stage. This stage is also about decentralization as well as the scalability of transaction processing for DApps and wallets.  


I am currently struggling with ETH but this news reminded me that I recently discovered a new platform that offers, among other things, benefits related to the transaction, price, and speed, and one of those platforms is Metis, I will probably try it out.  


A friend of mine who is using Metis also told me that Metis is amazing because it is solving problems that ETH has, such as  
simplicity, scalability also and things like storage, security, and savings. I think that is a perfect solution. It would be great if some of you share your experience with Metis, I've heard only the best things.",12,2022-02-05 19:41:10,14

In the real world, some crypto projects prioritise the environment and society over profit. Bob eco coin is one such project to look forward to, as it has social and cultural implications in African communities. While there are other fantastic projects to look at, such as sol and ADA.

ADA,CryptoMarkets,Am I a degen to have 50% of my portfolio in ADA? ,"Please elaborate, why I might be if you think so. 

I used to hodl LTC hard and switched over to ADA last summer at an okey price. Now doubt is crawling in whether its the right investment for this bullrun. There is no narrative, on-chain activity, devs (researched and compared to other chains on intotheblock) etc. are not that convincing. I ""need"" it to go to 6 $ to reach my financial goals. 

Tbh I can see a **\~**300 k BTC end of next year and could have just tried to ride that wave (though something around 200 k is more probable, obviously). 

SOL is a real shitcoin in it's fundamentals so thats why I despise to invest big in it, also it might 4X from here on most likely, tops (all speculation is out of my arse, of course). Didn't ever go that hard into ETH for same reason (don't believe in that eco system).

So ADA imho is the way to go when talking technology, but Hoskinson is a questionable guy and the token has zero narrative this season till now. 

Whats your thoughts?

ADA,CryptoMarkets,"Cardano Surges 1,218% in Key Metric — Will ADA Price Follow Suit?","
According to on-chain transaction data, Cardano whales have been largely absent since early July, coinciding with [ADA](https://blog.nanovest.io/berita/cardano-mengalami-lonjakan-1-218-pada-metrik-utama-ini-akankah-harga-ada-mengikuti-10402/) price consolidation. Since late June, daily inflows into ADA whales have remained below 5 million, except for a small spike at the beginning of the week.

Specifically, IntoTheBlock's on-chain data reveals a 1,218% increase in daily inflows to whale wallets recently, potentially indicating an impending rise in ADA price.

Cardano Experiences 1,218% Surge in Key Metric

As mentioned earlier, daily inflows into whale wallets have declined since July 5th. However, spurred by increased activity early in the week, inflows into whale wallets surged by 1,218%, with ADA jumping from 14.51 million on July 8th to 110.82 million on July 9th. This increase surpasses previous spikes of 1,218%.

The metric of Large Holders Inflow tracks how many ADA tokens flow into wallets holding at least 0.1% of the circulating ADA supply. According to Coinmarketcap data, each wallet tracked by this metric must hold at least 35.87 million ADA tokens to be considered a whale or large holder.

According to ADA distribution, only 0.01% of all Cardano addresses hold between 10 million to 100 million ADA tokens. However, they control a significant portion (36.26%) of the circulating coins, giving them influence over overall price movements.

Will ADA Price Follow?

Whale activity not only directly impacts prices but also affects overall market sentiment. When these major players move, it can boost confidence or spread fear among other whales and retail investors.

ADA recently hit a nine-month low of $0.3211 due to bearish sentiment but has since recovered and is now approaching positive levels over the past seven days. ADA has risen by 2.25% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.3936 at the time of writing.

ADA has lost its cup and handle formation on the price chart due to this short-term price increase. Ultimately, this could lead to a 70% price increase above the $1 threshold.

On the development side, Cardano's blockchain, once considered dormant, is poised to expand its network.

In summary, Cardano's recent surge in whale inflows suggests potential positive momentum for ADA's price. However, market conditions and whale behavior will ultimately dictate whether ADA can sustain and build upon this upward movement.

The token at one point hit $3, and the team seemed more enthusiastic than ever.

However, in the last few months, it seems they halted progress completely. I don't see any updates, Charles is barely uploading videos to his YouTube, and I get new Twitter updates. Did something happen and I didn't see?

The coin has since crashed bad, and I can't help but feel bad, as I have been on board for a couple of years now. Any news or events from the team at all?

I don't understand how they have fully gone MIA, a project cannot be left at all like that, they completely dropped the ball. I am obviously biased towards ADA and I will hang on as much as possible, but if I don't see the same passion for the project that I have, I might just call it quits.

I hold BTC, ETH and XLM on CoinBase PRO and I hold ADA, ALGO and IOTA on Binance. My favorite of the two is CoinBase PRO. I would hold most my coins on there but unfortunately not all are available on there. I do not use any wallets and honestly the wallets confuse the heck out of me. So any links and info on them would be amazing.

Any feedback in general would be amazing. Let me hear your thoughts on the coins that I have chosen too. I have done my own research, despite the fact that its all still difficult to understand.

ADA,CryptoMarkets,Plutus Pioneer made me dump Ada,"I was a Cardano fan boy, and I probably still am, but I dropped more than half my bag after trying to dive further into developing smart contracts on Cardano. Since all the Plutus Pioneer lectures and exercises are online, and I’m a programmer, I figured I would get a jump on things and skill up. 
The problem is, the attitude that Charles has, and seemly a lot of the team, is everything I hate about old style software development: measure 5000 times, cut once

Are there smart people involved? Yes! Are there great ideas and innovative thought? Yes! Am I surprised to hear that the testnet is failing? Not at all. Would a major flaw kill Cardano? Maybe, and it might take another 4 years to make a second cut.

Reading through the Plutus Pioneer material and messages, there is an overwhelming attitude that if you don’t understand UTXO and Haskell, it’s your own fault, and you should take a few years to study before you continue. “Plutus is a mathematician programmer’s program for mathematics programmers programming mathematics. If you don’t spend as long studying, as we took to build it, fuck you”, is what the opening slide for the Plutus Pioneers program said (I think. It went by kind of fast so I may be paraphrasing. That’s what it felt like it said). The second slide was for a lab where we are supposed to spend 4 years white boarding a Hello World smart contract. They want to make it clear that if they give us a nice shiny new platform, and we write garbage, we should self immolate. It’s like Charles was still trying to incorporate proof-of-work, and decided that developers needed to solve an increasingly more complicated development environment if they wanted to produce a contract on the chain. 

Plutus and Cardano, with its weird 1980s views on SDLC and waterfall methodology, may eventually produce some great stuff, but it’s going to take years for some projects to ramp up and release. Meanwhile, start ups will come along and try to go to market quickly, without the proper skills, and there will be a flood of slow and sloppy code, all blamed on Cardano.
It’s going to be like back in the 90s when every high school kid was writing Java applets for web sites. They were terribly written, slow, and hated by users, to the point that you never see Java applets on websites anymore.
Maybe I’m not smart. I’ll totally buy that. I could spend a few years getting a master’s degree in Plutus Alchemy, or I could use an easier platform and solve business needs quickly. Tough choice.",9,2021-09-04 19:33:21,19

ADA,CryptoMarkets,Pair ADA/ETH Annotated Weekly Chart - Strong Buy,"Hello. I trade penny stocks for about 24 years, based on charts.

I analyze about 100 charts per day, so I've analyzed over 600,000 charts in my life.

Very recently I was tempted by the hype with cryptocurrency, and I saw that is very easy to make money with crypto for someone like me who has many years of experience with Technical Analysis.

As I understood, crypto is 90% TA and 10% hype. Here I have the advantage of not having Market Makers manipulation and/or dilution, something that makes my life difficult on the stock market.

In a few days I fell in love with crypto, and I found it so easy that I even resolved to create a new subreddit where I will publicly turn 300 euros into 1 million euros. I want to begin with a small amount that almost any person has aside, and at the same time limit the risk in case something goes wrong.

I will show everything, all my buys and sells, balance, mistakes, strategy, etc, so everyone can learn from my mistakes, if they happen.

If anyone wants to follow my challenge here is the link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto1MEuroChallenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto1MEuroChallenge)

This analysis I post here below, has nothing to do with the challenge. It is not a recommendation to buy. It is just my opinion, based on technical analysis, and in my opinion a strong buy signal may happen very soon, when the dashed line is broken.

Price target = .00075 - .002

ADA,CryptoMarkets,"ETH 2.0, Solana, ADA. Where do you see them in the next 10 years? Who is going to lead?","Fairly certain I’m about to get dragged for this but in the sake of educating myself through getting ripped apart…. here’s a hot take.

Unless ETH can drastically reduce their gas fees I don’t see them continuing to hold the top spot in the long run. It was first to market and as a result has market share and notoriety but I don’t see it being a viable option for small players to enter the blockchain. In short, its too costly. Additionally, it’s not scalable/sustainable enough for large institutions to feel comfortable risking their enterprises on something a) they’re already unsure about, b) isn’t fully predictable so it limits them in overall utility. 

Solana has the speed and has addressed the gas fees, they definitely have a long term viability for people “the peoples network”. Fast, cheap, gets the job done -everything you need. Their biggest issue (afaik) is scalability/security. I don’t see large companies feeling comfortable with tossing their companies into something even remotely risky let alone something that could go down. 

ADA is secure, low fees, and scalable. Issue is development turn around is slow as hell from the peer review process, that’s not ideal when you need things to be fast paced in a growing company. “If you’re not first you’re last” is true in Ricky Bobby but especially in business. However on the flip side, this could be an ideal situation for larger institutions. Idk who all has worked at any +1000 employee company but even something as small as changing a button on a screen can take anywhere from months to a year to get sign off. I think their development schedule might actually benefit larger institutions 🤷‍♂️

ADA,Bitcoin,The floor has been raised. Bitcoin will never go below 40k ever again,"Obviously this a prediction, but outside of an instance of a World War III, and with that a total breakdown of global economics, Bitcoin’s value will continue to grow forever. I believe I’m being generous on a worse case scenario, too, the floor of it’s value is being raised everyday.

The volatility will be an ongoing thing in the near future, but the world is finally being orange-pilled at a now exponential rate.

As a long game HODLER, it is becoming so entertaining watching its rise, especially now. Including all the dips that happen currently, and the quick recovery. It is a VERY exciting time to hold Bitcoin.

If you are new to Bitcoin, get in and stay in. The sky is the limit, even famous deniers are finally coming around, and admitting it, as they are now buying in.

I feel very lucky I learned early enough to get in now, still early. I love the Bitcoin community in total, and here on Reddit. I’m loving being on this long-term ride with all of you.

Boy, a decent amount of negativity about a personal opinion, and speculation. I’ll back off, sorry to offend the nay-sayers 👎

Just a friendly, and perhaps too optimistic prediction. I would say at least double the low of a year and a half ago, around 16k. So, at least in the 30’s as a new low.
But the belief and optimism is real. The more people learn about it and get on board, the floor raises, as we gain new hodlers every day. Pretty sure the majority of Bitcoin maxi’s would agree, especially with the current trends of adoption. The farther out we go, the more people are getting involved.

ADA,Bitcoin,Easy way to make others do Bitcoin only,"Hi!

I was someone who trade for my other income. Basically from stocks trade. Since 2024 I learn and took opportunity about the halving price spike. Then later I learn about Bitcoin and I don't think will trade mine. 

I was trading any other coin and learn about it. I thought it's like buying stocks that i thought it will be up like an investment, but it's hard because the founder got so much token they will dump.   
  
But I could sell all my alts in profit or equal (-0.2% tax). 

  
Why all Bitcoiners not convinced others buy saying if coin A is good for example, why don't they ask that person to check coin A/BTC. if the charts uptrend, good. you could take opportunity to take some. If don't, why not just buy the BTC?  

  
Genuinely asking.

This is my mindset before I was thinking to invest some other small money that I don't use in short time. Let's not talk about the bitcoin, I will only sell it as my last option of death treats event.

What is your take on this?",25,2021-08-16 20:34:48,83
ADA,Bitcoin,"Slightly changing your ""DCA"" could be a win win","Hear me out. 

We all have our own routine of buying BTC.  
Some as soon as they are paid, they allocate X % 
Some buy daily , weekly or monthly.  
Some do whatever they can to buy and work towards that one+ orange pill.  

BTC price is pretty much driven by buying or selling pressure.  When the pressure builds up one way or another , BTC moves.  
Sure there are whales buying and unloading. 
But realistically it's traded up and down.  
A market has bulls/bears.  We need to accept there are those that want the price to drop, like any other market up and down.  If there were only buyers and holders  in any market the price would be one directional.  

Now that we have accepted that there are those that want to see BTC fall as they profit from this.  
We need to also accept that while we bulls ""buy the dip"" the bears ""short the pump"".  Period.  

BTC as well as the crypto markets have evolved into much more of a traditional market where using leverage, shorting , etc etc is readily available.  Lending / borrowing platforms also popping up everywhere.  

Here is my proposal to alter your DCA buying BTC.  

Bears and bulls look for signals when trading.  
One being the obvious order book.  I understand spoofing exists but let's talk trading.  
Most people when they  DCA they simply put their $100 or whatever in and spot buy and go one with their day.  Or they have automatic setup to buy X daily or whatever.  
If we were to stop spot buying and continue our DCA with limit orders $500 or $1000 or whatever below book this will build pressure on the buying side.   When the order book doesn't have shit for pressure lined up, bears see this and know when shorting the price will drop substantially.  As they can clearly see through the order book how much BTC will be absorbed on the sale and what it will take to move the market.  

The old saying bulls walk up the stairs and bears jump out the window.  This is very true.  
There are many more bulls slowly buying in small amounts of BTC , but the bears are tho les of them, moving more BTC at once.  Also let's be real, anyone who is DCAing right now already owns some BTC , so would like price to go upwards and the most recent DCA deposit really isn't going to make a difference when it comes to ""missing out"".   Your last $50 deposit isn't going to change your life if BTC goes to $100,000 overnight and you couldn't get that extra $50 in there.  But building pressure in the order book with limit orders can and will deter bears from pulling the trigger on a short position if enough pressure is there.  
Also if it falls a little , well you get it cheaper.  Win win.  

Maybe try setting limit orders instead.  If you just absolutely need to have BTC at full price , that's fine set the order $100 lower than the spot price.  Or $250 lower.  We all have bought them instantly wished we waited 10 min that's for sure.  

/Rant.  
Just my opinion.  
Good luck to all",45,2022-03-17 20:10:00,62
ADA,Bitcoin,What Raoul Pal gets wrong about Bitcoin:,"Raoul Pal sold his coins because he believes our community is too toxic.

A lot of people who just engagement farm for clicks, a lot of elitist snobs who think their shit smells better than yours, and there's a ton of corrupt moderators running the social groups (including this sub). It's all true, I've seen it all.

But what Raoul Pal doesn't understand is that **bitcoin doesn't care**. Bitcoin is neutral money and the shitty people are merely a reflection of humanity, not of bitcoin.

>A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990’s.

(Satoshi views on centralization and how he believes bitcoin differs from dotcom bubble era projects e-gold and e-cash.)

>Bitcoin would be convenient for people who don’t have a credit card or don’t want to use the cards they have, either don’t want the spouse to see it on the bill or don’t trust giving their number to “porn guys”, or afraid of recurring billing.

(Satoshi explaining that Bitcoin would be useful for private transactions we don't want public)

&#x200B;

>When someone tries to buy all the world’s supply of a scarce asset, the more they buy the higher the price goes. At some point, it gets too expensive for them to buy any more. It’s great for the people who owned it beforehand because they get to sell it to the corner at crazy high prices. \[...\] Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.

(Satoshi's opinion on Bitcoin price appreciation)

&#x200B;

>The possibility to be anonymous or pseudonymous relies on you not revealing any identifying information about yourself in connection with the bitcoin addresses you use. If you post your bitcoin address on the web, then you’re associating that address and any transactions with it with the name you posted under. If you posted under a handle that you haven’t associated with your real identity, then you’re still pseudonymous.

(Satoshi's opinion on anonymity and KYC)

&#x200B;

>I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.

(Satoshi thought bitcoin would either disappear or become a phenomenon. There was no in-between)

&#x200B;

>Being open source means anyone can independently review the code. If it was closed source, nobody could verify the security. I think it’s essential for a program of this nature to be open source.

(Satoshi had strong beliefs about keeping code open source)

>I’m better with code than with words though.

>I’ve been working on bitcoin’s design since 2007.

(Satoshi revealing how long Bitcoin has been in development)

A brief history of money

Historians agree that humans invented money before they invented written language. Think about that. We were able to agree on how to exchange value before we were able to write down our thoughts. The origins of money are more fundamental to human nature than our desire to communicate, in a way.

Money served three purposes:

* A store of wealth across time. People could store today's effort for using it tomorrow.
* A medium of exchange, to procure things from others.
* A unit of account, to record credit-debit relationships.

Starting with the barter system, humans moved on to using common goods with intrinsic value (such as cows and bags of wheat) and then to units like cowrie shells, glass beads which were more convenient for accounting because of their **divisibility.** There was a problem with this system, though. You guessed it.

People who had access to the means of production of cowrie shells or glass beads could flood the market, *and the more money there was in the market, the less value it had.* This is what happened in Africa when glass beads merchants from Europe imported loads of glass beads and made them worthless as a form of money. (This could be one of the first recorded instances of **inflation**).

**Gold** was a solution to the cheap creation of money. Mining gold is a difficult task. Flooding the supply of money was difficult unless people took the effort to mine gold, for which they were compensated. But the quality of gold could always be debased and there was no way to check its authenticity.

Governments took on the responsibility of **controlling the supply** and **guaranteeing the validity** of money. This has always worked fine until it hasn't. As long as the government acts in a neutral capacity to do the best thing for the economy, there is no problem. But the people who are closest to the means of production of money - Kings, Central Bankers, Cabinet Members - also have the most incentive to confiscate a large share for themselves. Or they could follow a monetary policy that might make them look good in the short term while throwing the system into chaos in the long run. This can be seen in the case of the Fall of Rome and Constantinople, the hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, the shift of the US and other countries away from the Gold standard \[1\], and the inflation that is looming over the US right now.

Looking at history, what would the perfect currency look like?

* **Convenient to handle.** It should be divisible, portable, safe to store, and easy to transact with. Units should be interchangeable (fungible).
* **Credible.** The validity of the money should be guaranteed in some way, either by its intrinsic value or by some mechanism such as the backing of a counterparty (like the Government).
* **Liquid.** It should be easy to find people who accept payment with it.
* **Secure.** If the money can be compromised, it cannot store wealth.
* **Inflation resistant.** It should be hard to create and resistant to control by small groups of people with vested interests.
* **Stable.** The value should not have significant volatility.

The most important requirement though is that people **adopt it** en masse. Money is a collective story that people believe in, a story that lets them exchange value with each other. If an ecosystem is built around this story, it gives the money more value, further strengthening people's beliefs.

**How does Bitcoin do on these grounds?** Let us start by understanding what Bitcoin is and why it is so different from existing forms of money.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a **decentralized** digital **cryptocurrency** that can be used for **peer-to-peer transactions** through a **distributed ledger.** Let's unpack that.

* **Bitcoin is decentralized.** There is no government, organization, or single authority that controls the policies of Bitcoin.
* **Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency** \- A form of digitized money whose units cannot be duplicated.
* **Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions** \- There is no reliance on a central banking system.
* **Bitcoin operates through a distributed ledger** \- A copy of every transaction ever made on the Bitcoin network is stored in all the nodes of the network! But because each transaction is anonymized, you can effectively check only your own transactions.

Bitcoin was invented in 2008 (in the throes of the housing crisis market crash) by a figure named Satoshi Nakamoto whose real identity is unknown. Satoshi open-sourced the code to Bitcoin after publishing a white paper about it, and as more people started adopting it, Satoshi vanished mysteriously.

https://preview.redd.it/nnpbdr6h8j181.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=41f367db0a2fd213e829b8a37284fd75e8789fc0

To the layman, Bitcoin is currently just like any other stock or asset that you can exchange dollars for. To use Bitcoin, all that is needed is a wallet that gives the user a **public address** that others can transact with, and a **private key** that acts as a password. Bitcoin can be bought at **cryptocurrency exchanges** or mined (will be explained shortly). This is then stored in software or hardware wallets, and exchanged for products or services with other users. There is no central authority over Bitcoin.

Each Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million units called Satoshis for convenience.

Since 2008, Bitcoin has grown in leaps and bounds to become a dominant force in the market and people's imagination. But...

Where does Bitcoin get its value from?

We saw earlier that if it’s easy to make money, anybody can flood the market and destroy its value. This was also the reason for gold's adoption for minting coins because gold is very hard to produce (apart from being nice and shiny).

The government's ability to print massive amounts of money is the chief danger to modern forms of money. Imagine you have a million dollars and it’s worthless tomorrow because a bunch of people in the government thought it's alright to print another quadrillion dollars. That's the fear which drives people to invest in real estate, stocks, gold, and other commodities. **There is no alternative government-backed currency in circulation today that qualifies as ""hard money""**, whose supply is restricted.

That's one of Bitcoin's chief attractions. Bitcoin is *extremely hard to produce* and *has a cap on its supply*. Each block that needs to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain (distributed ledger) needs to be identified by a number that satisfies a mathematical property. \[2\] Bitcoins are produced by ""miners"" who try to find these numbers by running through millions of options in a brute-force manner. When miners hit upon a successful candidate, **they are rewarded in Bitcoins**. This is a highly energy-intensive process and the profit that the miners get is in the thin margin between electricity consumption and the value of the bitcoin.

https://preview.redd.it/1pced6gi8j181.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ed333c93c9aff06f29350bd7654fb053ac15d83

The physical exchange of energy for bitcoin is similar to expending effort in mining gold. The second feature is that **there can be only 21 million Bitcoins in existence**, ever. This is a hard feature of its code that cannot be changed. \[3\] 20 million Bitcoin would be mined by 2025 (by current estimates). By 2140, all of the Bitcoin would be mined, and the incentive for miners will be in the form of transaction fees. As the supply of Bitcoin is finite, **it cannot be devalued by increasing the supply** making it inflation resistant by design.

There is no central authority for Bitcoin. The code is open-sourced, and if anybody wants to change it, it has to be with the consensus of all the nodes in the network. For example, when some security vulnerabilities were identified in Bitcoin in 2018, a fork (change in the code) was done to patch it which was accepted by all users as it was for their benefit \[4\]. But when **hard forks** (major changes) were done to create new currencies like Bitcoin Cash, the bulk of users chose to stay on the existing network, causing Bitcoin Cash's value to drop sharply. Hence, **Bitcoin's value is decided by the consensus of the network.**

The above points show that Bitcoin is ***convenient, inflation resistant, secure, and credible*** (its validity is backed by a mathematical function that is impossible to break or fake).

This tells us about the **perceived value** of Bitcoin, but if the aim of Bitcoin is to capture the existing market, it also needs to be:

1. Liquid and exchangeable with existing currencies
2. Fuel for a thriving economy
3. Stable

How does Bitcoin do on these fronts?

Liquidity

Let's be real here. Most people are interested in Bitcoin not because of its fascinating mathematical properties or promise of inflation resistance. It's because of the **“Number go up”** that every influencer is shouting about on Twitter as if it’s their personal achievement. That's the reason Bitcoin tends to get on the nerves of some people too: **How is it that believers of an imaginary concept with no “value” or “business” behind it are rewarded time and again without any effort?**

The misconception here is that Bitcoin is being compared with businesses on the stock market which grow with time because of their value proposition and execution. Bitcoin is better compared with gold whose value is dictated by **scarcity.** The problem is that, unlike gold which has intrinsic value, Bitcoin's value is entirely dependent on the faith that people have in **the story around it.**

The story around Bitcoin is this:

**“Bitcoin is the hardest form of money and will eventually replace all currencies.”**

People who adhere to this vision are called **Bitcoin Maximalists.** And in terms of the stories out there, Bitcoin is one of the fastest proliferating. It makes sense. When personal incentive is tied with a story, the FOMO kicks in of being penniless when Bitcoin takes over. The possibility of gain makes people buy into it in droves. **And as people buy into it, demand rises, and its price goes up further.**

**Bitcoin's strongest point is also its weakest. Decentralization.**

Though Bitcoin claims to be “decentralized”, that's only if Bitcoin becomes money in itself. To convert from dollar to Bitcoin, you still need **the presence of exchanges.** These exchanges are among the most loosely regulated financial entities in the world and the most vulnerable to government regulation. For example, Tether, which debuted as a *Stablecoin* (a cryptocurrency pegged to a commodity or government-backed currency) has repeatedly come under scrutiny for its shady accounting practices. \[5\] Tether also turned out to be owned by the same people who owned Bitfinex, a large cryptocurrency exchange. **It is one of the biggest intermediaries for Bitcoin to Dollar liquidity out there, and a collapse on that front due to regulations might cause a mad rush to exit.**

Of course, Bitcoin maximalists will argue that if one exchange goes down, another will come up, and we will learn from our mistakes. But is there enough incentive to learn from our mistakes? Shouldn't Bitcoin be actually **useful for buying things?**

The Bitcoin economy - and competitors

One of the biggest jokes in the history of Bitcoin was when Laszlo Hanyecz of Florida traded 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas. That would be worth $574 million today, maybe the costliest meal ever. \[6\] But that was one of the first recorded instances of **a physical good bought with Bitcoin.**

https://preview.redd.it/zjyphu8l8j181.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=b518e681fb09313178c602ee0d06d9a363a803e2

Since then, there has been a rapid increase in the adoption of Bitcoin as a mode of payment. From retail needs to domain names, from cars to travel packages to restaurants to cellular service, the scope of Bitcoin has expanded tremendously.\[7\] There's even a house on sale that you can buy **exclusively with Bitcoin.** But there are things that you **cannot** buy with Bitcoin yet. There's no direct provision to buy stocks on the NASDAQ (or any other market) with cryptocurrencies, for example.

A big market for Bitcoin is their programmability - **Smart Contracts will automate the market of trust.** People don't need to believe that someone else will pay them back on time and spend time in legal battles. A clause like “If rains don't arrive, farmers get paid insurance” can be automated to simplify the market of crop insurance. But this is also a space where Bitcoin has tough competition.

Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and a handful of other cryptocurrency blockchains (with tokens called *AltCoins*) sprouted to tackle problems that Bitcoin couldn’t. Bitcoin Maximalists argue that Bitcoin has the first-mover advantage and anything other currencies can do, Bitcoin can absorb into its code - But the facts speak otherwise. When Ether started out, its trading volume was only a fraction of Bitcoin’s, but after Ether started catering to the NFT and DAO space, **it's now a serious threat to Bitcoin’s dominance**. Other cryptos assert that they do different things in a better manner compared to Bitcoin. Dogecoin was a mere joke till someone catapulted it to prominence. [I'm looking at you, Elon.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1396698902842122244?s=20)

But one thing is for sure - It’s very difficult for a new entrant to the Altcoin space to gain traction and reach ***while standing for the same principles that Bitcoin does.*** There is so much awareness about cryptocurrencies now that the bulk of a new Altcoin offering will be bought out by a single entity. And that makes the cryptocurrency useless because its value is in its reach.

**It's not money unless everyone believes it is.**

A strong warning is in place here: When I say a new cryptocurrency is useless, I’m talking about the long term. Coin Offerings have a very strong possibility of being a Ponzi scheme, so be VERY VERY careful with where you put your money.

There's just one more reason that Bitcoin and other Altcoins are still not widespread in their use.

Volatility

Bitcoin is very volatile compared to the US Dollar. This is something that even maximalists don't argue with. It is not clear whether volatility is increasing or decreasing with time and trading volume, but you can't use something as **money** if you don't know what it will be worth days, hours, even minutes from now. This is the reason Bitcoin is the butt of so many jokes like this:

>A 10 year old boy asks his father for a [#BitCoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitCoin?src=hashtag_click)📷 for his birthday. Dad can I please have just one BitCoin for my birthday as a gift ? Father: What ? Why the hell you need $ 14,433 Do you know $ 15,367 is a lot of money. What would you do with $ 12,456 dollars ?

But the assertion is that on the ***technology adoption curve***, Bitcoin is still in the early majority stage, and the amount of capital that has been injected into Bitcoin is minuscule compared to how much more can be injected (The figures are based on growth in Market Cap, number of users, and number of transactions - Unreliable, because one individual can have any number of Bitcoin Addresses and transactions could be just buying and selling of Bitcoin, not retail transactions).

https://preview.redd.it/mha3u2hm8j181.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfc02d49dc659dd8ffe651f5945974fa046cbf7a

Here we enter the realm of speculation. We must understand that Bitcoin is the first of its kind - A resource that is absolutely scarce, meaning that it is the first deflationary money. Some assert that the inbuilt scarcity will make volatility an inevitable feature of Bitcoin, rather than a bug. \[9\] Supporters of Bitcoin assert that as we cross over from early majority to late majority in the adoption curve, Bitcoin will start seeing massive adoption and this will stabilize the price (How exactly? I’m not sure. I don't have enough know-how to assess this).

All this talk is fine, but everybody gangsta till the big daddy of money steps in.

Will the Government be sleeping?

Bitcoin started out in anonymity and it was then laughed off as a joke. Later, governments started referring to it as a highly speculative asset, and now there are murmurs that Bitcoin is going to overthrow the monopoly that the Government has over money. El Salvador has accepted Bitcoin as legal tender and announced that it would be starting the world's first ""Bitcoin City"". What on earth is going on?

In the standard narrative about Bitcoin, after Bitcoin starts gaining mass adoption there comes a phase where some Central Bank starts getting shifty about the hyperinflation that is rampant in the economy, and starts **buying Bitcoin to hedge against the possibility of economic collapse.** Other banks follow suit, doing the same, and when rumors break out, the citizens start buying up Bitcoin and rapid adoption of Bitcoin follows suit with Bitcoin replacing the dominant currency of the country. This phase is called **hyperbitcoinization.**

That sounds great, except that the government isn't going to take this lying down. Apart from the ominous angle that money is one of the chief ways that the government uses to control its citizens, there is one logical reason that the government will oppose Bitcoin: **The government needs to pay its employees** and it has no means of production to produce or purchase Bitcoin scalably. How will public institutions sustain themselves in the absence of cash flow? There seems to be a dreamlike scenario where the government voluntarily relinquishes power and takes a backseat as all institutions are privatized, but since Satoshi vanished without leaving a manifesto on how legal institutions and the military will be funded, there seems to be a gaping hole in this grand scheme.

There is no doubt that Bitcoin will play an important role in the world economy. Even now, [Bitcoin's market cap ranks it as 14th in the list of world economies](https://coinmarketcap.com/fiat-currencies/) (with Ether at 25th). World countries switched to the gold standard when gold emerged as the hardest form of money and then switched to pegging themselves against the dollar. **It is highly likely that Bitcoin (or other Altcoins) will be a standard/commodity in the future.** But instead of Bitcoin overthrowing governments, or governments banning Bitcoin (which is very resource-intensive and difficult), it is more likely that governments will **assimilate Bitcoin into their legal framework.** Bitcoin might be taxed, its use cases monitored and transactions tracked. \[10\] Though the Indian and Chinese governments banned Bitcoin, India is now taking a softer stance by trying to tax cryptocurrency gains heavily. The lasting change might actually be in terms of **the inability of governments to manipulate the price of Bitcoin.**

And though hyperbitcoinization sounds cool (or ridiculous, depending on how you see it), it is not realistic or even desirable. The real meaning of this scenario sounds like a breakdown of world government (highly unlikely) \[11\]. Hopefully, it doesn't get that far.

A bitcoinized world: Good, bad or ugly?

The advantages of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are touted as follows:

1. Greater freedom of the individual
2. Resistance to inflation
3. Delegation of trust to a mathematical system
4. Reduction in government interference

The notion of decentralization has created this idea that Bitcoin is going to create a symmetric world of equal opportunity. There are some counterpoints to that argument:

1. The initial distribution of Bitcoin is hugely skewed. By some accounts, 85% of the entire Bitcoin supply is in the hands of ""whales"" who constitute just 2% of the user base (But this doesn't give them a higher edge unless the Bitcoin economy develops). \[12\]
2. Though Bitcoin promises economic opportunities for the entire world in theory, only about 60% of the world has access to the Internet.
3. Bitcoiners’ claim that Bitcoin is the only competitive cryptocurrency out there is unproven. There is no clear data on how many people believe in Bitcoin **as an asset, as money, and as a novelty.**
4. It isn't that hard for governments to launch **a coordinated attack on cryptocurrencies** \[13\]. The hope is that the political neutrality of Bitcoin and the personal incentive it holds gives it the edge in the long run.
5. Governments and corporations can give incentives by minting their own cryptocurrencies in certain geographical regions or internet spaces, an advantage that Bitcoin cannot outcompete without violating its neutrality.

So will we see Bitcoin rise to ascendance in this century?

Can Bitcoin replace the dollar?

If we consolidate all the points we have seen so far, we can see that Bitcoin is a convenient, portable form of money that gives a lot of freedom to the individual. It has gone from 0 to $56,000 (as of today), crossing a market cap of $1 Trillion in **a mere 13 years (Apple Computers took 38 years to hit the same milestone - with a solid business and advertising team backing it).** Since Bitcoin is a form of money that is native to the internet, the rate at which its story propagates is also phenomenal.

Bitcoin’s true decentralization and first-mover advantage also give it a great advantage over other cryptocurrencies. Though there is tough competition, some of Bitcoin’s core principles like the lack of a central authority give it a real edge (e.g Meta tried to start its own currency Libra/Diem, and it faced regulatory action instantly. Ethereum isn’t truly decentralized either).

The real challenges for Bitcoin are **price stability,** **exclusive use cases,** and **government regulation.** People will only consider Bitcoin money when they are willing to part with it for *something they cannot get* with conventional money. Till then, it’s an asset at most. Although smart contracts and a few niche use cases like NFTs seem to satisfy this, only time will tell if they have a lasting impact.

Price stability is also more likely when Bitcoin has a strong native economy. There are different assertions about its stability - That high-frequency trading is needed to stabilise it, that creation of value will stabilise price, that in spite of boom and bust the new low is always higher than before, that price will stabilise when the number of users keeps growing, and that its price cannot be stabilised as it is an asset. The truth is that nobody has been right at forecasting either its growth or stability reliably and it’s extremely difficult to do so because **we haven’t seen anything like this before.**

Government regulation is the biggest factor. Without all countries of the world having a uniform stance towards Bitcoin, it might just create arbitrage between different countries, not being the “global currency” that it claims to be. Some milestones to watch out for would be:

* The first Central Bank to store Bitcoin as Reserve currency.
* Clear legislation or regulatory action that is favorable to Bitcoin.
* Stock Exchanges trading Bitcoin as a commodity on par with Gold and Oil.

If any of the above happens, it heralds wider acceptance and greater stability. But with government regulation, there is **a greater probability that Bitcoin will coexist with world currencies rather than overthrow them.**

Conclusion

Though the American dollar is ubiquitous today and the central pillar of the global economy, it wasn't always so. The first American dollars were minted in 1792. But it was only in the aftermath of World War 2 in 1944 that the dollar became the standard for other global currencies - 152 years after its inception!

On the contrary, Bitcoin has already become a force to reckon with in just 13 years. It's questionable whether the “market cap” of Bitcoin represents any “real” economic growth, but as more people believe in it, there is more incentive to build an economy around it.

Bitcoin is unlikely to replace the Dollar anytime soon, but the coexistence of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with world currencies is highly likely and something to watch out for. \[14\]

Though I don’t agree with everything he says, it gives a solid framework for beginners to think about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and inspired many questions in this article.

**Footnotes:**

\[1\] The Gold standard is a controversial topic. Some have hailed it as utopian, others think it’s impractical for the global economy to revert to it. We’ll never know for sure as there’s no country that has hard money today.

\[2\] The problem is based on the SHA-256 cipher which relies on the fact that it’s very hard to factorize large numbers. Some suggest that quantum computers might be able to break this, but it’s highly unlikely and if it happens, Bitcoin is the least of our worries - Many security systems rely on SHA-256, including modern banks.

\[5\] Check this [video by Coffeezilla](https://youtu.be/-whuXHSL1Pg) where he does a terrific job of investigating Tether, consulting some experts on the subject.

ADA,Bitcoin,Sticking to Just BTC,"I was quite late to the crypto space having made my first purchase in April 2018, I've invested heavily since though. When I first got in to crypto I bought lots of different cryptocurrencies, this is because when J first got in to crypto people was saying that ""all boats will rise"" and that basically you'll make money investing in any project as blockchain is the future. Obviously that turned out to be very wrong. My first purchase was some Ethereum, after though I bought some Bitcoin and then Litecoin. As time went on I ended up buying many currencies such as XRP (hated it even when I bought it), Cardano, Monero, TRON, Dash and ARK (awful investment). As time went on I found myself losing trust in many alts so I was swapping them for BTC until about a year later I held just BTC and ETH. In all honesty I love ETH and I'm not for one second saying it's going to fail because I don't think so, but right now I'm happy with the money I have and I don't see the risk worth it when it has so many competitors that are faster and more scalable etc. I'm confident ETH will do well in the future and if so it may have more upside than BTC in the short to mid-term but I'm certain BTC is here to stay, I'm happier with a safer investment.

I know some people may say after just one year maybe I didn't give some of these projects like Cardano enough time, and that may be true I admit. Also I want to clear the air on the whole profits bit at the end, not to sound cliche but I do care about the tech and the movement behind BTC, I've been in to crypto for almost two year now and I've never once sold and have no intentions in doing so for many years. I am in it for the tech and the movement but obviously I don't want to lose money either! I feel like I'm in a weird situation right now as many people may call me a Bitcoin Maximalist but that's not true, other projects will succeed also but I've reached a point now where I'm not as greedy chasing alts for big gains, I like BTC for what it is and happy to stick with it.",19,2020-02-02 02:39:11,46

ADA,Bitcoin,How I possibly lost my crypto forever,"I’m typing this out for those who are in the crypto space or thinking about it. This is a true story and I would advise everyone to take note and don’t mess up like myself. 

In 2017 I learned so much about crypto from the homie so I did my due diligence and went ahead and bought some via coinbase shortly after. In total I’ve probably put in 1500-2500 into it with money that I didn’t miss in case it went bust. I bought in when btc was at its highest at the time. I think it was 6-7k per coin. So I tried my hand at trading but it was too much work as I wanted something more passive. So when the Bread wallet ICO dropped I took in some of those coins and eventually moved my crypto from binance and coinbase to my Bread wallet. They give you 12 words that you type in case you need to recover the wallet so I type those in my phone and let my crypto bubble. Now I will add that I had an iPhone 7 with thumbprint ID and that is how I opened my wallets.

To the people that decided to hodl in 2018 there was a blood bath. My wallet lost a ton a value so I decided to focus my crypto into 4-5 coins and bought a ton of Cardano and Stellar lumen. I copped over 1000 of each. Over the last 6 months I’ve noticed ADA is getting more popular and starting to rise so my portfolio is looking nice again. In December I decided to get the exodus wallet because it supported the ADA coin as Binance said they wouldn’t service the US anymore. They gave me a 12 phrase key as well and I put those in my phone. 

Now fast fwd to last week, I try to unlock my phone but my thumbprint won’t work because it had been too long since I checked it. (It was overnight) I go to type in my 6 digit iPhone password just to open my phone and it says it’s wrong. Confused I keep trying and I keep getting denied. I’m not too worried at that point but eventually I disable my iPhone by trying the password too many times. Fuck it this is an iPhone 7 I’ll go ahead and upgrade to a newer joint. I get the 11 and I setup my cloud and start getting my apps back from my previous phone. I download both the bread and exodus wallets and it’s time to put in the 12 phrase key. Now this is where I fucked up initially. So my iPhone users know about the Notes app and that is where I typed out my 2 12 key phrases to access my wallets. The fucked up part is I locked the note with my passwords with my thumbprint and the new iPhones no longer have the thumbprint. It’s asking me for my password to type out but I don’t ever remember typing in a password. I’ve tried all week to remember the password and it’s not coming to me at all. 

There is a silver lining tho so the BRD wallet I opened back in 2017 I wrote those keys on a piece of paper and found it. That wallet was worth more than the Exodus wallet. But the exodus has all of my cardano and if that ever goes to $100 a coin then I’d be sick but I got something back. If you’ve read this far I appreciate it. So to the rookies if you get a digital wallet then make sure you write your keys down and put them in your phone. Leave yourself multiple ways to recover if possible! Now I need to cop some ADA while it’s still low and start over.",5,2021-03-12 16:35:24,17
ADA,Bitcoin,Will bitcoin hold its value as an asset used for preservation of wealth even if another alt-coin becomes the main coin used in real world transactions?,"Bitcoin has a low 20 million coin cap, which should mean that it will increase in value over time as scarcity increases. However, Bitcoins transaction speeds are much slower than other coins such as Ethereum or Cardano, which makes it less attractive for real world exchanging of goods and services.

ADA,Bitcoin,"Unpopular opinion, bitcoin hype needs to die for the tech to thrive (civilized discussion).","I am excited about blockchain and what it can do, but I am conflicted with bitcoin. I am quite sure that bitcoin hype needs to die for the underlying tech to thrive. I just don't think it should die now because it is doing a really good job at ""marketing blockchain"". 

&#x200B;

Bitcoin kicked off blockchain tech back in the late 2000's. Since then a lot of new tech has surfaced. Bitcoin is a gen one cryptocurrency. Then Etherium came along, it is a gen two blockchain introducing smart contracts and a lot of new functionality, but it still has its problems. Now gen three cryptocurrencies are starting to thrive (ex Cardano). 

&#x200B;

The more I look into bitcoin the less promising it looks, yet it has all the hype. The ""altcoins"" & ""shit coins"" take the backstage yet they stand to have a greater impact on the world than bitcoin does (at least some of them). I bet the real winner has not even been created. 

&#x200B;

The best analogy I was able to come up with is the car. The car just came out, 95% of the world don't see the point of it, but early adopters see how valuable it is and they want to jump in early. They say the car will eventually dominate, yet people that prefer hose say they are crazy. So the 5% is trying to accumulate as many Ford Model T's as possible. Yet right next to the Ford Model T you have a Tesla, yet all the hype is around the Ford Model T...

&#x200B;

I will leave some technical & nontechnical resources that I watched/read in the last few weeks. They really got me excited for the tech and I think some of you might find it useful.

ADA,Bitcoin,Bitcoin and the enviroment,"So I was wondering why people are blaming BTC for having a bad impact on the enviroment. Because of the mining rigs, but forget that mining Gold uses 3/4 times more energy then mining BTC. 

Also when looked at the source of the miners most of them are in places where it is profitable to use ""green"" energy, such as solar panels. I mean miners aren't stupid. Why pay for electricity if you can have it for free, right? Look at China, 30% of all btc is mined there. However it is mined in places where enviromental friendly electricity is cheaper then other kinds, so wouldn't miners use that instead? Unless they hate money and absolutely hate the enviroment xD

\[Pardon my english it's far from my native language\]

Update: yess i am aware that there are things like cardano which have proof of stake. And yess those would be far better. However i think btc is here to stay and i feel like people are using the enviroment is an way to spread fud.

ADA,Bitcoin,"Ever Flown Around Inside Bitcoin? IOHK Introduces Symphony 2.0: The first ever 3D, immersive blockchain explorer","&#x200B;

[\(L\) Bitcoin transactions: The higher the larger value; \(R\) Mempool w\/ incoming tx.s](https://preview.redd.it/tnqhpygxli931.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f626219be1597713982f15031d1c4cdf03a9d913)

The Symphony project began with a question: how do we represent blockchain technology in a way that is stimulating, entertaining, and audio-visually engaging for a wider audience, technical and non-technical. In other words, how do we explain the abstract and give form to the formless.

&#x200B;

It’s been over a year since we answered that question, and we’re still working to make Symphony the most interactive and immersive blockchain experience available. What began as a way to visualize the blockchain has evolved into a way to experience the blockchain: an immersive journey accessible through your device’s browser.

&#x200B;

The result is [Symphony 2.0](http://symphony.iohk.io): a 3D explorer through which anyone can traverse the topographic history of the Bitcoin blockchain, from the first transaction to the most recent. Compared with the first version, Symphony 2.0 goes deeper in every way. It drills down into transaction data to create a live soundscape – each block has its own unique audio signature – using data-driven sound synthesis. It looks like this:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[The flight simulation over the bitcoin network. Watch out for incoming tx.s!](https://reddit.com/link/cbk5v9/video/xqqjq777mi931/player)

# How it Works

As you can imagine, giving feeling to data isn’t easy. Creating a sound for each block was how I wanted to represent the uniqueness and permanence of the blockchain: once added, a block is there forever, making that same sound, containing those same transactions.

&#x200B;

I used a technique called additive synthesis to generate sound on the fly, and utilized the parallel nature of graphics cards to synthesize a unique sound for each of the thousands of transactions that can make up a block. The sound signature that plays when you visit a block consists of each transaction producing eight sine waves (a fundamental pitch and seven harmonics). The fundamental pitch is determined by the transaction value, and the amount of randomness added to the harmonics partials is controlled by the fee-to-value ratio of the transaction.

&#x200B;

# Design Philosophy

With Symphony 2.0, the blockchain’s mempool – which stores unconfirmed transactions – is visualized as a gravitational swell, around which confirmed transactions spiral in concentric rings. Think of Saturn’s rings but, instead of particles of ice and rock, we have transactions, continuously adding to the size of the rings as they extend outwards. Then, undergirding each block are Merkle trees represented, unsurprisingly, as trees.

&#x200B;

[View Top Down: Transactions as pillars, on top of blocks, on top of Merkle trees; Mempool in background](https://preview.redd.it/3xie1cvmmi931.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b0e54c3a15856a8b5864f5033221e7bb3d9303)

On top of each block, confirmed transactions are visualized as 3D hexagons. Their height corresponds to the transaction volume, and their width (note the rotund individuals to the right of the image above) corresponds to the health of the block. The result is an unprecedented imagining of the blockchain, with its representative parts synced and manifest, explorable block-by-block or through a flight-simulator mode.

# Ways to Experience Symphony

Symphony 2.0 is now [**live**](https://symphony.iohk.io/) It can be accessed using any modern web browser, but is best experienced in Google Chrome. For laptop and mobile device users, it’s advised to select the Medium quality option and, for those with high-performance devices or dedicated graphics support, the High quality option. Performance optimizations will continue into the future.

&#x200B;

Together with our friends at Kuva, a Bristol-based creative agency, we’ve also grown the project to include events and exhibition pieces. These events – one of which was held [**this year in Bristol**](https://iohk.io/blog/symphony-of-blockchains-project-comes-to-bristol/) – have included a number of exhibitions that showcase different parts of the project, including virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).

&#x200B;

Using WebVR software, I built a VR experience based on the code for Symphony 2.0, which demonstrates the extensibility of the system. This will be exhibited at future events and, I hope, one day available for VR headsets at home.

&#x200B;

# What’s Next

We’re going on tour. We have the story, and now we need an audience. I’m also starting to build an Ethereum version using the same code base, which will feature explorable smart contracts, and, more networks after that. We know there are thousands of people out there who are only faintly familiar with blockchain technology and want to know more – and with Symphony 2.0, they’ll be able to cut through the confusion. **A picture tells a thousand words, and an interactive audio-visual experience tells many more.**

&#x200B;

Symphony is a long-term project. It’s as much an adventure for us as our audience. We want to see how far we can take it – because blockchain technology is still developing, still growing, and the opportunity for education is only just beginning. The release of Symphony 2.0 marks a significant milestone for us, and we’re thrilled to be sharing it with you. There’s a lot of opportunity for Symphony, from optimizations and incorporation of other blockchains, to events and more ways to enjoy Symphony at home. So, stay tuned for more updates and, in the meantime, enjoy the world’s first interactive blockchain experience.

ADA,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s electricity consumption / environmental impact is a bad objection, but everyone (not just BTC) needs a solution. [OC; Effort post]","*TL;DR: While the electricity consumption objection is often fallacious, there is a non-fallacious counterpart. We can and should address the environmental impact of activities directly and indirectly caused by Bitcoin. But solutions are not a prerequisite for Bitcoin’s wider adoption, nor should be taken seriously as such – that is a red herring.*

The argument against bitcoin for electricity consumption has fallacious and non-fallacious versions.

Here is a common argument pattern:

* Bitcoin enthusiast says, “Bitcoin solves problems X, Y, and Z for commerce and monetary policy. It should be adopted over other currencies.”
* Non-bitcoiner critic responds, “but Bitcoin uses such an incredible amount of electricity,” *without addressing how well it solves X, Y, or Z or admitting that Bitcoin solves real problems.*

On the face of it, this would be simply raising a *different* problem to solve, Problem E (whether the high electricity consumption problem or the environmental impact problem; I will lump them together as Problem E). We can grant this. Yet even if problem E is one we *can* solve and *should* be solved, it isn’t obvious how this is relevant to BTC. Insofar as it is irrelevant, it tends toward a fallacy in reasoning.

Among the different forms of the Problem E objection, there is a non-fallacious argument form. It brings up how some other viable cryptocurrency competes with BTC, in that it solves all the same monetary problems BTC solves, but *also* reduces or removes problem E while BTC does not (as much). Point taken as far as that goes (and I shall return to this below). However, there are many different fallacious versions as well. One fallacious version suggests that Bitcoin shouldn’t be adopted unless the electricity problem is solved. In other words, a prerequisite to bitcoin adoption is solving the renewable energy conundrum. An even more fallacious version of this objection suggests that *Bitcoin* should solve it or reduce it, by design, lest there is some immoral or irresponsible activity going on with BTC.

First, Bitcoin was not intended to solve Problem E. It is not its stated aim. But insofar as miners recognize this as a problem to be solved *in general*, individuals have a personal responsibility to reduce their own environmental impact where it is reasonable and appropriate to do so. It should be noted that disproportionately, Bitcoin mining relies on more renewable resources than many other currencies. So, if someone suggests that BTC does not solve problem E, that isn’t a failure of BTC or its mining community. It is a concern felt and addressed in part by the same community, even if it does not threaten the viability of their investment. \[The former point is simply analytic and straightforward. But the latter is an empirical question about the commonality practices of miners, and whether BTC miners are environmentally-conscious is contingent. I myself have a very small mining rig and I live just outside Niagara Falls region, where much of the power is generated by renewable power sources, such as the Niagara Power system.\]

The second point: Bitcoin should not be expected to solve problem E. On the one hand, it is not unique to Bitcoin to solve it, since all currencies face this issue. On the other hand, Bitcoin has no special relationship with electricity to generate a special obligation above the other currencies.

In the first case, every economic exchange with a monetary instrument intervening relies on resources to be spent (gold, mining and minting gold coin; greenbacks, printing ink on cotton; debit card, plastics, metals, and electronic infrastructure; etc.). In the modern market, the exchanges are increasingly becoming more and more electronic-based, whether charging a debit card at Target, NFC chips to swipe via Square, or buying on Amazon via PayPal. These all require electricity, and the consumption is very large when taken in aggregate. Rather than considering electricity as a bug or problem, Bitcoin takes this as a cue to creatively reuse the existing electronic infrastructure to solve other problems, as a way of making electronic exchanges more common and enhance their capabilities.

In the second case, Bitcoin’s electrical consumption is essential to its use, and in that sense, it is special in its relationship to electricity. But that does not entail that it inherits a special obligation to reduce its electricity use or promote renewable resources simply on that basis. Instead that would be on the miners, and it is in their interest to mine with efficient technology to reduce electricity waste. Insofar as miners have an interest in finding ways to reduce electricity waste, BTC blockchain remains stable while the environmental impact lessens. And so, if this were a good objection against BTC, then currencies that BTC competes with, including and especially fiat currencies, have just as much of a burden to reduce the byproducts of their use as well – to reduce paper, electricity, water, etc. in printing, washing, distributing, and retrieving greenbacks. In important senses, these resources are even harder to renew without waste than electricity is. Furthermore, BTC’s environmental impact is indirect. It does not contribute to smog; it does not affect the Ozone layer; it has no CO2 output. It is very different from a Hummer or diesel-powered truck. The burden does not belong to BTC in a special way; and if we were consistent in this standard, then the objection loses its particular force. I see no similar calls for eliminating waste in greenbacks, though there are some reforms called for eliminating the copper penny (since it costs more to make than it is worth in use). By analogy, it is clear to me that electric, self-driving cars should be the future of transportation, but it is by no means electric car companies’ responsibility to solve the problem of finding new electrical sources, when it already solves the bigger and more pressing problem of using fossil fuels. Society bears the burden of finding electricity sources as an environmentally-friendly energy, and just as those electric car companies have an interest in making it widely available for refueling, miners have an interest in widely available electronic infrastructure.

The third point: any environmental impact due to electrical consumption is a real problem to be addressed, but this a problem with generating renewable energy, not how it is spent. There are two sides of this. The first side is that there is a general problem with generating energy in creative and sustainable ways. The second side is that we spend electricity on countless other activities that we find valuable even though we know the cost, and if we are consistent in attacking BTC, then we should attack those activities too. The first side is very straightforward, so I won’t spend much time on it: as a society we need to rethink how we acquire electricity. Public fear and ignorance concerning nuclear power prevents us from powering cities and even states with an abundant resource. We are seeing more and more wind farms and watermills, and we need to reduce their negative impacts where we can. But this is a general problem for society to solve, not for Bitcoin in particular. The second side is that we should be consistent with our objection. If the sheer fact that some activity consumes a lot of energy is a major flaw, then we would need to apply this not only to currencies that use electricity (as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, etc.), but also the activities that are not currencies such as watching football or YouTube or porn sites, all of which consume massive amounts of electricity when taken in aggregate. And yet there is no call to take down the NFL or FIFA or YouTube or Pornhub on the bases of their electrical uses, either in the production or distribution or consumption. Yet is Bitcoin mining causing a rise in electrical costs? Or is Bitcoin mining demanding even nearly as much as these others? Is it causing a bottleneck in access to sustainable energy? If Bitcoin mining causes a bottleneck in resources to electricity, then other larger offenders should be addressed first. If wider adoption changes this story, then that would be where the objection is relevant, but it is by no means a bar for entry in the first place.

The fourth point: Bitcoin should be assessed by its merits and demerits compared to its competitors. Bitcoin has two main competition categories – fiat currencies and crypto currencies. For the former, BTC does not do worse. We could expand on all the benefits of BTC over fiat currencies (many of which are inflationary, guided by corrupt government practices, etc.). We could also extol BTC for the practical problems that BTC solves relative to the US dollar as it is used in the current monetary system, such as allowing cheap, verifiable, and anonymous wire transfers (in competition with Western Union, MoneyGram, PayPal, Zelle, etc.) without the use of a custodial bank account (in competition with JP Morgan-Chase, Wells Fargo, CitiBank, US Bank, PNC, CapitalOne, etc.; as well MasterCard, Visa, American Express, NetSpend, Green Dot, Rushcard, etc.) for which overdrafts are a predatory practice (charging for double-spending with hefty fines) and maintenance/inactivity fees are insult to injury (an account that has little use is penalized by taking away its funds in regular intervals until all funds are gone). BTC is not yet infected by any such nonsense while it gives control back to the owners. Pardon the slight tangent. All of these involve electricity consumption, but BTC does better on these other metrics, and so *ceteris paribus* we have an argument in favor of BTC rather than a single defeater, problem E.

Lastly, the only place where this objection has non-fallacious application is in distinction with other cryptocurrencies. Here we can focus on BTC’s relationship to its competitors in crypto. It is important that Bitcoin is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) design, rather than some other like Proof-of-Stake (PoS). I have my own reservations about PoS as a monetary design, but it is clear to me that Cardano, which is PoS, demonstrates that decentralized finance can use significantly less electricity. Some reports are that it can use 99.5% less electricity than its PoW counterparts. Ethereum’s community plans to follow a similar model, to replace its PoW model with PoS, in order to improve efficiency (claiming the same percentage reduction), despite the material harm it will bring to its miners. (I say ‘harm’ in terms of comparative account of harm, where benefit and access to goods are removed or reduced compared to when there is no such intervention.) There are likewise dozens of other cryptocurrencies that were started with PoS by design like Cardano, but unlike Cardano are very early in development or extremely risky as an asset.

Let’s grant all of this. Let’s grant that PoS is more efficient in electricity, and let’s grant that it sufficiently solves problem E with respect to the burden any cryptocurrency might shoulder. The question in part is whether these other cryptocurrencies are as viable for use, unified by a philosophical front, and solve the same problems as BTC intended to solve. In Cardano’s case, there is much to recommend it, but it lacks a unified philosophical position to generate principles down the road and remain future-proof. Ethereum is clearly a viable competitor, given its known practical uses and token-layer benefits (these all speak to its staying power). It will likely win a lot of market share when it eventually moves to PoS in the years to come (I say this tongue-in-cheek, since ETH has scheduled upgrades with repeated delays). But it comes with monetary and philosophical problems (non-deflationary monetary policy, for one) and the aforementioned harms to its own investors (the mining community). Smaller PoS currencies might merit some airtime, but I will remain brief. Moreover, I need not mention other PoW currencies like LiteCoin and Bitcoin Cash (since they have no advantages, or *nearly* no advantages, over BTC).

History as it is, BTC has much wider perceived value and demonstrated use cases across the globe. If this situation is going to change, then two things can happen: 

1. BTC can lose its perceived value in favor of a different currency that is otherwise all-things-considered better than BTC at solving the problems BTC intended to solve. BTC is dominant and is projected to remain so. But this is contingent. Some competition might beat out BTC in some unknown future. If a currency can mimic BTC in design in every regard except being less energy-demanding, BTC would be competing solely based on brand/name recognition. Brand is valuable, but can be dethroned or at least mocked (as happens in commercial chains).
2. BTC can adopt a different model for blockchain verification that is less energy-demanding (e.g., PoS or some other). I hear from many in the community that this is an avenue that will not even be considered. Not only the miners will not allow it, but it also falls within some larger principle for how BTC operates. For that, I am not convinced that BTC must be forever PoW. This is all new technology and a decade of evolutions to tech make some upgrades inevitable when their advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages. Switching away from PoW might be one of those designs we revise. While it is entirely possible that BTC will remain static in this regard, this would be at the risk of becoming the FORTRAN or Pascal of the cryptocurrency domain. It does not seem to be obvious it needs to be, however.",1,2021-06-09 16:07:47,0

ADA,Bitcoin,Crypto TAXES - Some tips,"Let me be clear, I am no accountant nor tax expert, but I have been able to at least point some people in the right direction in regards to the new GOP tax plan and how it relates to cryptos. 

First, the new tax plan royally screws over crypto investors because it makes trading a coin for another coin a *taxable event.* This means, if you trade bitcoin (or any other coin for that matter) for, say, cardano, you must pay your gains on that bitcoin you are transferring. It also screws over people who want to cash out their btc, as they typically traded it for ltc to lower the fees. To be fair this has been a loophole, and perhaps this regulation will legitimize cryptos. Still, it's a pain in the ass. Anyways, while this element of the tax plan eliminated a gray area in the cryptospace, it makes the trading process a bit harder. To the people who've been asking me for advice, I tell them to instantly buy ethereum and trade this for the coin/token they want. This way, they can avoid capital gains on their *newly* purchased ethereum. Of course, the ethereum they have purchased can change in value, but only by a couple dollars between the time they buy that ethereum amount and exchange that for another coin. I doubt Big Brother will care about a couple dollars UNLESS you are raking in massive gains. Anyways, the moral of the story is that if you want to obtain a coin from, say, binance, you can still avoid paying capital gains on your cryptos if you use a newly bought coin from your *bank account* rather than a coin that has been sitting in your (Example) coinbase account or wallet appreciating over the last couple weeks/months/years.

This may be a gray area, as it is utilizing the LIFO technique on taxes. Still, LIFO is a *LEGAL* way to pay taxes.

Like I said, do your own research, but I just wanted to tell you what I do. Please contribute to this post, as it can help a lot of people! Thanks!",3,2018-01-04 02:16:38,13

ADA,Bitcoin,Bitcoin Transaction Tracker in Augmented Reality,"Nice app to try!

&#x200B;

The Transaction Tracker app enables you to look up  individual transactions and blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain and see a  visual representation of the mem pool in augmented reality. The app  provides information on the health and status of the Bitcoin blockchain,  giving you the average value and number of transactions and enables you  to see whether your transaction has been confirmed and implemented into  the blockchain.

Coming soon…Ethereum and Cardano transaction trackers, for better evaluation and comparison of your cryptocurrencies.

ADA,Bitcoin,"For cryptos / dApps to work, we need to lose trust in our governments","Disclaimer: I've been trying desperately hard to figure out a usecase for trustless. Am a new researcher to this area.

My main reasoning for basing on government is

1. if you don't trust a company, you can simply switch to another company. Also they are enforced by rules and government. If they break rules, they will get arrested.
2. Only governments have the ability to flout the law, because in essence they are the law. So the only other way for citizens to fight back is turn to one thing that the law / government has no control over, a trustless decentralised thing. (blockchain, ether etc...)

If the above 2 arguments is true, then all major applications for blockchain need to be done in countries where citizens don't trust their government and something the government would naturally want to censor.

Perhaps reason why cryptos like Cardano are looking to Africa for their future. People want a secure future and they don't trust their government.

Any ideas or thoughts on this?

It's being conveyed as a currency when at the moment its more similar to a commodity in that there is no real liquidity, its though to spend. The reason it's like a commodity? It's illiquid, you can't spend it easily in its original form, and the value isn't in the asset itself, it's in the currency the asset is most commonly linked too (in this case USD). So in short, Bitcoin for newcomers is a slow and expensive machine, they struggle to spend it without changing back to USD (or other currency). What will lightning bring? SPEED & SAVINGS, which in turn produce LIQUIDITY and thus VALUE. I guess my point is, lightning, hurry up and help send this currency/commodity/unicorn to the stratosphere.",9,2017-12-30 13:19:58,5

# Kuva discusses Symphony project updates

Symphony is an experience unlike any other. We’ve [talked about it as an interactive, audio-visual exploration of the Bitcoin blockchain](https://iohk.io/blog/symphony-of-blockchains/), but it’s becoming much more. Not just because we’re not stopping with Bitcoin – soon, Ethereum, then any blockchain thereafter – but because we’re continually optimizing and upgrading the experience, allowing the user to dive deeper into the blockchain through mixed-reality encounters.

&#x200B;

Part of what we wanted to create is a better way to absorb information. People aren’t sponges. Abstract concepts don’t always stick, and unfamiliarity breaks the narrative thread we need to engage with an idea. But when we can create that experience visually, interactively, we’re able to ground the abstract into an unforgettable experience that is, ultimately, fun: a living story.

# About Kuva

Kuva is an interactive design and creative technology studio based in Bristol, UK. We’re a collection of artists, technologists, and engineers working with companies to blend art and technology into online and physical experiences. We’ve worked with IOHK on Symphony since the launch of the award-winning Symphony website in January 2018.

&#x200B;

Our [first gallery installation for Symphony was this year](https://iohk.io/blog/symphony-of-blockchains-project-comes-to-bristol/), in April, at the Arnolfini in Bristol and, soon after, we were in Miami for the IOHK summit. Since then, the teams at Kuva and IOHK have gone down slightly different paths, exploring different ways to expand the experience. You can learn more about IOHK’s work in [this blog post](https://iohk.io/blog/announcing-the-release-of-symphony-2/). Here, I’ll go through what Kuva has been up to, and what the future holds for Symphony.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lki6ur9086c31.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa408235be9c40e34057847e91353dc239691b7c

# Project Updates

We have a global tour planned for Symphony to introduce the blockchain to more people. For the most part, the blockchain is known in uncertain terms (the cryptocurrency market has led to a few erroneous perceptions, which we’d love to correct). Elsewhere, it’s barely known at all. If it’s going to underpin the future – which we believe it is – then we have a responsibility to start education as soon as possible. And at Kuva, we believe the best way to educate is through experiential storytelling.

https://preview.redd.it/it968s7786c31.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfc9db441270bcbfc23dda0669ae8f5d8cdc89c0

This starts with our virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) projects. These experiences, which are demonstrated in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Pzg50QnI4/), are designed as educational pieces that use different approaches (such as our AR posters) to explain how the blockchain works. We take some of the most complex components underpinning blockchains and break them down into easy-to-digest, understandable elements. We want to show the usefulness of blockchains and, by extension, cryptocurrencies, by illustrating them in ways people can relate to.

&#x200B;

But the blockchain doesn’t start and end with Bitcoin. We’re also working on bringing an Ethereum chapter to these events, to demonstrate the evolution of cryptocurrencies and the technology as a whole. We’ll be able to explain and illustrate smart contracts, and show how blockchains can be used for more than financial transactions. Then, in the future, we’ll start looking at Cardano as a third-generation blockchain: how it’s different, and what it’s capable of achieving over others.

&#x200B;

# Mobile App

The most exciting update is about our mobile app, soon to be [available on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Kuva.TransactionTracker&hl=en_GB/), and later on iOS. This contains a data visualization of the Bitcoin mempool in 3D and augmented reality, to show you the congestion and health of the Bitcoin blockchain at any time.

https://preview.redd.it/0gplff0b86c31.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=efd36789c9eecf04ae8cdf349983bee573a0b08a

Using the app, you’ll be able to see whether it’s a good time to send a transaction. Visually, the busier the mempool is – ie, the more red lines it has swirling about it – the busier the network is, which means a higher fee. The average fee is precisely detailed in the app.

&#x200B;

Like our other VR and AR work, we’ll soon be creating the same experience as we did for Bitcoin, for Ethereum and other blockchains, to help users evaluate and compare fees and network traffic. We want users to have consistently up-to-date information about how best to use their cryptocurrencies – bridging the gap between interest and understanding starts with clear, interactive representations of key concepts and components.

&#x200B;

We’re really excited about this app. It’ll not only be an easy way to grasp what’s happening on a blockchain at any moment, but a functional tool that provides transaction data in real-time. The app is already available on Android and an augmented reality iOS version will be released this summer. We’ll also soon be announcing updates for our world tour – so stay tuned, and get ready to discover the blockchain anew.

ADA,Bitcoin,BitMEX: Good Or Bad for the Bitcoin Market?,"Its pretty evident that the cat is out of the bag and a lot of crypto traders noticed what happened when BitMEX went offline for a brief period during a scheduled maintenance last night. The exchange that has traded over 1 Million Bitcoin (BTC) in a day on two occasions, has been the fan favorite for traders who are taking advantage of the bear market and want to short the digital assets of Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA), EOS, Ethereum (ETH), Tron (TRX) and XRP.

&#x200B;

***​Its also public knowledge amongst traders that # Trading over there is as fast as greased lightning.***

&#x200B;

The million dollar question?? The value of BTC is if BitMEX is a friend or enemy to the general ecosystem of Bitcoin in the crypto markets. One argument that has been postulated is that during that one hour of maintenance on BitMEX, a majority of the short positions in the global crypto markets were inactive. This then means the Bulls had a chance to go long on BTC thus triggering a buying spree and a price increment.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, one may say that shorting Bitcoin and other digital assets is simply destroying the ecosystem and even preventing the SEC from approving ETFs based on the fact that the markets are too volatile. The reason why SEC declined 8 ETF proposals is it aims to at all times prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices, in short mandates to protect investors from shady trading,

&#x200B;

​The other side may argue that Bitmex is the oldest derivatives trading platform and has offered great trading/ investment options and in return also grown exponentially, so instance Bitmex enting the most expensive offices in Hong Kong.

ADA,Bitcoin,"""The Correct Strategy of Bitcoin Entrepreneurship"" by Daniel Krawisz | Satoshi Nakamoto Institute Mempool","[***The Correct Strategy of Bitcoin Entrepreneurship***](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-correct-strategy-of-bitcoin-entrepreneurship/) by Daniel Krawisz

**We're All in This Together**

Bitcoin entrepreneurs have yet to appreciate fully collaborative nature of the Bitcoin economy and its implications for entrepreneurial strategy. Every successful entrepreneurial act improves the Bitcoin economy and attracts more people in, thus raising the value of the coins. Each new service benefits everyone else who is already invested. Consequently, Bitcoin businesses do not necessarily need to see themselves as competitors to one another. Even if they have the same business model, they both have more to gain from the influx of new users from outside than by taking customers from one another.

Furthermore, the growth of any Bitcoin business is limited ultimately by the growth of Bitcoin itself. Since the number of coins is strictly capped, the currency must grow with its price. This means that few business can be expected to earn a much better return than the coin itself over time. Entrepreneurs should therefore invest in coins, not businesses, because coins are where the profit is. In addition, if Bitcoin fails, then the Bitcoin businesses fail—so Bitcoin is less risky than any Bitcoin business too. Thus, Bitcoin entrepreneurs should be less interested in *making money* than in *making bitcoins into money*. An entrepreneur who follows that precept should generally be expected to be more successful than otherwise because the potential for Bitcoin itself is so much greater than any Bitcoin business he could invest in.

Of course, Bitcoin cannot succeed without businesses, or at least some sort of entrepreneurship. What is the best way to fund ventures in an environment in which they are relatively poor investments? The trick, I propose, is to think of these ventures more as donations to the Bitcoin economy than as profit-seeking ventures. Any useful Bitcoin service will tend to make the Bitcoin price increase because it adds value to the network. It may, therefore, be perfectly rational for a Bitcoin investor to contribute the service to the economy for free. Furthermore, the success of such a business being desired by everyone who holds coins, such a business can be run more like a non-profit or open-source project than an business. Thus, a new venture may attract investment even if it is not profitable as long as it provides a service the Bitcoin world needs.

In mid 2013 Armory, an open-source Bitcoin wallet project, received $600k in seed funding without even though [nobody knows](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-wallet-armory-raises-600k-seed-funding/) how it will eventually be monetized. These people have the right idea, but they shouldn't try to monetize it at all—it is obviously making all the coins more valuable.

Don't be a venture capitalist—be a speculative philanthropist.

**Labor Is Scarcer than Ideas**

The task ahead of us is monumental—the construction of a new financial economy to replace the one built around the national currencies. This will take a lot of work. Unfortunately, a lot of work is being wasted right now. The venture capitalists are looking to invest in a sharp team with a cool idea but the group of people that matters most is the entire network of Bitcoin users, and the idea that matters most is Bitcoin itself. Big new ideas get hyped up almost every week around here, and the Bitcoin economy will work a lot better if people would try harder to ignore them.

There are lots of business ideas floating around and limited time to create them. Only ideas that have a very high probably of being an important part of the future Bitcoin economy should be implemented because that is all we have time for and those are the only ideas worth risking Bitcoins on.

The proof that ideas aren't scarce is that anybody can make his own [altcoin](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-coming-demise-of-altcoins/) at any time. Already there are hundreds, and every one of them a bad idea from people who [don't understand](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-problem-with-altcoins/) the cumulative benefits of cooperation. Since entrepreneurs don't understand Bitcoin very well yet, it is easy to dazzle them with technobabble and funnel investment into flawed projects like Protoshares, Mastercoin, and Ethereum that have a very low probability of furthering Bitcoin adoption to any significant degree.

There is no real reason to keep secrets because the more that everyone knows about what everyone else is doing, the more easily they can decide what the Bitcoin economy most needs of them. Everything about a business can be done openly for the benefit of the entire industry. Product development, future plans, market research, finances; everything except private customer data, which shouldn't be collected anyway, and, in the case of illegal Tor businesses, the real identities and locations of the owners. We need open business and open businesses.

**Entrepreneurship as a Collaborative Scientific Enterprise**

In an open-business world, less experimentation is necessary to produce a workable system than among other businesses because there is no reason to keep secrets from one another. All trial-and-error should immediately benefit all the other Bitcoin entrepreneurs so that everyone can more easily figure out the most effective way to work. Open business as a generally accepted best practice would have eliminated terrible businesses like MtGox and Butterfly Labs early on. But even that would have been too late. Everything possible should be done to try to eliminate ideas *before* they can turn into failed businesses. That means sharing all ideas with the community, and investing in nothing that does not already have widespread community support.

Much of the Bitcoin world already works very openly. Lots of terrible ideas get shot down all the time in the Bitcointalk.com forums. All the software is open source. However, more is required: Bitcoin entrepreneurship should be run more like scientific research than a gold rush or an Internet bubble. There should be open research into the future Bitcoin economy, complete with peer review and consensus over which ideas are the most useful and important. Investment should focus on ideas that already have been vetted by the community. It should be considered reprehensible for startups [to invent](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/momentum.pdf) [their own](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-Dagger) cryptographic algorithms.

It is too much of a waste of resources to test ideas in experiments with real businesses. All business models ought to be carefully critiqued beforehand and only the most necessary ones that we have time for should be created. This is not central planning; it is consensus-based entrepreneurship. No one shall be forced to follow any idea at all; it is simply in everyone's best interest to cooperate. If I am right, then soon investors will learn to back only heavily vetted ideas and entrepreneurs will it as well.

In the early Renaissance, mathematics was practiced in secret and mathematicians carefully guarded their own discoveries because a mathematicians' career depended on being able to show patrons that he could solve problems other mathematicians could not. However, in 1545, [Gerolamo Cardano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano) sparked a new trend with *[Ars Magna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Magna_%28Gerolamo_Cardano%29)*, the first published work to include the general solutions of the cubic and quartic equations. He even included secret work (with citation) by Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia, which whom Cardano had promised not to reveal. Gradually, mathematics transformed into a tradition characterized by publication rather than secrets. Open-access publishing is now demanded. Entrepreneurship is in its Renaissance still.

**Conclusion**

In a low-growth economy, one grows rich by carefully leveraging one's skills and assets so as to negotiate the most profitable trades. In other words, wealth comes from performing better than everyone else. It makes sense to guard closely any edge that one might have. Whereas in a high-growth economy, wealth comes from doing as well as everyone else. It is more difficult to improve one's state relative to everyone else than to enjoy the overall growth that improves everybody's state.[1]

The Bitcoin world understands this instinctively, but needs to take it to its logical conclusion. The entire Bitcoin economy needs to be open-sourced. This is how to make Bitcoin succeed most quickly and with the least effort, which is the best outcome for everyone.

Let's get to work.

[1] In a post-singularity world, everything should be expected to grow at a phenomenal rate, similar to the growth of the Bitcoin economy today. Thus, I would expect the attitude of sharing and collaboration should apply generally.↩",26,2014-05-16 22:27:07,5

As first published on forbes.com

A week before Christmas, this headline about a random cryptocurrency no one has ever heard of was read more than most best sellers: Asians ‘Going Mad’ For Ripple Coin.  At the time, Ripple (XRP) was worth around a dollar. Today it is worth $2.45.

This will be the year that more unknown cryptocurrencies double in value.  How many will quadruple in value is anybody’s guess.

Sure, many of these new coins will disappear from the market. At their heart, the cryptocurrency craze is like the start-up craze, on steroids. Newly minted companies are going around the venture capital world, issuing their own digital currency, and having almost no problem at all finding willing investors. Got snake oil? No problem! Someone in Asia will take two bottles worth.

While setting up an initial coin offering is not cheap and needs upfront angel investing to foot the bill, the ICO market has turned what was once a half dozen cryptocurrencies led by bitcoin, into a $650 billion market overrun by over a thousand cryptocurrencies. These currencies are tied to new, unknown companies selling products and services no one has ever heard of, understands, and may have no real use for.
 As an investment vehicle, the cryptocoin is the market’s version of a poker chip. If you thought junk bond lords in the 80s were nuts…

Nuts? Oh, really?

The cryptocurrency bubble, if you will, has thousands of nutty investors laughing all the way to the bank. Literally.

If ripple coin has doubled in value, what are the odds of some other coins doubling too? Very high, in fact. Those odds are keeping investors looking down market at lower price coins. There is just too much upside, and no one has yet been willing to come forward to the press to say just how much money they’ve lost. The world is full of stories of people who lost all their money in their new business or saw half their life savings evaporate due to a crashing stock market or a financial swindle. But we have yet to meet the person who lost their shirt on a bitcoin bet.

And if their shirt is the only thing they are losing, then that’s not a cause for concern yet. Until investors come forth with big losses, the trend is your friend in 2018.

Tuesday marked the first trading day of the new year for American cryptocoin investors. Only three of the top 20 coins started off in the red.  Little known coins issued by startups like Tron and China’s NEO are up over 30% as of late Tuesday morning.

Tron is worth a mere six cents. China blockchain platform and Ethereum rival NEO sells for around $100 a coin.

Three years ago, one bitcoin was $15. It’s worth over $15,000 now. If one NEO is worth 3,000% more in 2021, like bitcoin since 2012, then it’s worth the gamble, most investors believe. A $100 loss isn’t putting anyone in the poorhouse.

Ethereum, an early entrant to the blockchain/cryptocurrency buildout, was created by Russian-born tech genius Vitalik Buterin. He’s now a millionaire many times over.

Another Russia,  Pavlov Durov, now residing in Dubai, is rumored to issue coins this year for Telegram, the messaging service most used in the crypto world. Durov did not return requests for comment at this time.

All someone like Durov has to do is look around him and see the money that is being made from nothing.

Pavel Durov is the brainchild behind Telegram, the messaging app most used by cryptocurrency startups. According to the virtual water cooler chatter of the crypto-world, Telegram is planning their own digital currency in a billion-dollar initial coin offering. (AP Photo/Tatan Syuflana, File)

Nearly $3 billion worth of Ethereum’s ether coin was traded between the exchanges in the past 24 hours. The total market capitalization hit $84.12 billion, meaning this Russian developed blockchain is now worth around $15 billion more than Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, Petrobras, a company with over 60 years experience in the oil and gas markets, and one that actually has hard assets worth real money.

That’s no longer a viable comparison. Bitcoin and ripple are worth even more than Petrobras.  Bitcoin’s market cap is the equivalent of Chevron’s. Ripple’s market cap is just shy of Goldman Sachs’.

Alexey Ivanov, fund manager at Polynom Crypto Capital in Moscow, thinks unknown Ethereum competitor Cardano Cryptocurrency will double this year. It’s up over 500% since its ICO in late 2017. One coin goes for just $0.77.

“Once Cardano is added to a regulated platform, it can double,” he says. Volume is next to nothing on that coin because the blockchain infrastructure company is still working on so-called “proof of stake” coding to verify digital transactions.

Ethereum is currently working out the kinks in its own system, to help remove bottlenecks. Ivanov thinks that’s why the coin is up 17% on Tuesday.

David Herne, the American hedge fund manager behind the Specialized Research and Investment Group in Moscow, likes Waves, the Russian developed blockchain startup working with the Moscow Stock Exchange on a pilot program that would allow for trading in cryptos by qualified investors.  That coin goes for $13.21 today and already has a billion dollar market cap.

Buying cryptocurrencies is not liking picking a stock on E-Trade. E-Trade is like the intermediary between an investor and the New York Stock Exchange. There is no such comparable entity in the crypto world. Instead, there are many exchanges, some bigger and better than others.  Not all carry the same digital currencies, and the proof of identification process can day days if not a week to complete. Exchanges like Kraken and Bitstamp, which allow users to buy ripple coin, are spotty. (They were down both times I tried using them last week.)

“Call it a bubble if you like, but can you really afford to stay out of crytocurrencies?” writes Naeem Aslam, chief market strategist for ThinkMarkets in London. He posted his views here on Forbes.com.

* **Cryptomania was unquestionably the major talking point of 2017.  The question is: can you make money while still thinking there is a bubble? Giving a straight answer: if you can afford to lose an amount which won’t make any meaningful difference in your life, then by all means, dabble. An average American aged between 20-64 earns approximately $27-50K a year.  In the grand scheme of things, $100 invested in cryptocurrency has a minuscule probability to impact anyone dramatically. The rewards are undoubtedly there.“**

In 2018, investors are going to spend time discovering newer companies and their coins, especially those that do not cost the price of a new car (think Kia Soul, for instance).

As a result of this trend, bitcoin’s dominance of the cryptocurrency market has fallen to its lowest level in five years. As of now, bitcoin’s market cap is $233.6 billion, accounting for 36% of the total value of all cryptocurrencies. In January 2017, bitcoin accounted for 80% of all trading in crypto.",1,2018-03-01 20:29:59,0

The global economy and global liquidity are the leading factors driving these bull markets. Bitcoin's value is a reflection of fiat currency inflation and economic production. The more money the world prints the more we see Bitcoin rise in value. When you consider the scarcity of Bitcoin it makes sense that this would serve as a hedge against inflation in some way, like gold but not exactly like gold.

>Bitcoin would be convenient for people who don’t have a credit card or don’t want to use the cards they have, either don’t want the spouse to see it on the bill or don’t trust giving their number to “porn guys”, or afraid of recurring billing.

(Satoshi explaining that Bitcoin would be useful for private transactions we don't want public)

&#x200B;

>When someone tries to buy all the world’s supply of a scarce asset, the more they buy the higher the price goes. At some point, it gets too expensive for them to buy any more. It’s great for the people who owned it beforehand because they get to sell it to the corner at crazy high prices. \[...\] Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more.

>The possibility to be anonymous or pseudonymous relies on you not revealing any identifying information about yourself in connection with the bitcoin addresses you use. If you post your bitcoin address on the web, then you’re associating that address and any transactions with it with the name you posted under. If you posted under a handle that you haven’t associated with your real identity, then you’re still pseudonymous.

&#x200B;

>I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.

(Satoshi thought bitcoin would either disappear or become a phenomenon. There was no in-between)

&#x200B;

>Being open source means anyone can independently review the code. If it was closed source, nobody could verify the security. I think it’s essential for a program of this nature to be open source.

What does ""layer 2"" means? Does a bank running mysql in a centralized way to manage customer's balance and querying bitcoin as part of its function qualify as ""layer 2""?

ADA,Bitcoin,I’m so bullish,"I first heard about bitcoin in passing back during the 2017 bull run, but didn’t do much digging until 2020. That’s when I first bought bitcoin and decided to HODL a little, “just in case it catches on.”

2022. Bitcoin is down a lot. We witnessed so much death and destruction in the crypto industry, yet Bitcoin’s value proposition hasn’t changed. This was when it finally hit me. We can hold our OWN COINS via self-custody. No trust is needed from any kind of financial institution. 21 million coins. No more, no less. This is true financial freedom.

In 2023, Bitcoin is now up 60% from the bottom in USD terms, despite the macro fears and other FUD. While no one can truly make price predictions, the halving is one year away and given previous cycle’s performances, Bitcoin may be the turning point in many of our lives. 

It’s a privilege to be able to accumulate and understand Bitcoin and sometimes I feel like I’m seeing something that my peers may not for the time being. I’m doing what’s best for myself, to escape our current financial system (I mean, I just assume at this point I won’t even be getting Social Security…gotta take care of myself somehow).

ADA,Bitcoin,Why are you always losing money in crypto??,"Just felt like sharing some thoughts after seeing the market behaviour in btc the past week. Feel free to disagree. 


Most of the times new people buying in crypto gets screwed due to these factors:

1) FUD - Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt - Dumps due to fear and entering a trade with an amount that they are unable to manage

2) FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out - Pumps due to fear of missing out in a rush, and usually with an amount that they are unable to manage due to greed.

3) Trend Traders - Traders who trade using their own TA (technical analysis), other people's TA, social media hype, memes, news. All the TA signals gets amplified or overemphasised and you get screwed by trying to time the market. 

4) Whale Manipulators - Tries to instigate the market with larger than normal pump and dump volumes. You react by doing what they want, usually panic selling.

5) You don’t understand what you are buying. You can never trust something that you don’t understand, 99% of the time, hence -> panic selling -> losing money.

Safest way to invest or buy in to crypto that you should do: 

1) Buy fundamentally sound, long-standing coins with long price history (BTC,ETH,ADA,etc):
Buy at the dips, slowly DCA (Dollar cost average in), HOLD what you bought when it DUMPS and DCA more, sell a portion and NOT ALL when it PUMPS / goes hyperbolic for cash to buy in next DUMP/dip. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T PANIC SELL.

2) For new coins that gets pumped out of now where:
buy in only with what you can lose, and sell/cash out at intervals. DON'T TRY TO GUESS THE TIPPING POINT. 

3) Don’t destroy your daily life by looking at the charts every single minute and react emotionally, or invest with what you cant afford to lose. You can never win by reacting emotionally. 

4) Research and learn about the fundamentals and technology. Knowing what you are buying in gives you the confidence to hold your ground.

Non exhaustive but Hope it helps. If only everyone in the community understands where crypto is going, buying  in coins like btc, eth, Ada or even other alt coins should be a stress free decision that you are taking for your future.

ADA,Bitcoin,"Father passed away with large amount of crypto currencies, I need help"," 

Disclosure: I am not fully knowledgable in all the crypto currencies.

My father got really into crypto trading in 2020 but really ramped up in 2021. Around 75% of the crypto is Bitcoin and Ethereum and the remain 25% is spread between 10 other crypto currencies.

What is making this incredibly difficult is that the balances are spread between different apps including exchanges, hot wallets, cold wallets etc. There are hundreds or thousands of transactions that occurred during 2021.

I am trying to figure out how to do the 2021 taxes. There are three accounts that have the most significant balances: Voyager, BlockFI and Celsius. BlockFI and Celsius have both provided 1099-MISC forms.

Voyager has proven to be more difficult since the platform has not provided any tax documents. Voyager recommends tax site, cryptotrader.tax. The site is saying there is around $55,000 in short term capital gains. I have some concerns since the cost basis is missing so that number is incorrect. I am not sure how to back track due to the number of transfers between wallets, crypto swaps, staking, interest, rewards etc.

The family accountant and lawyer do not know how to handle the crypto accounts. He paid for a service called Taxbit but they recommended getting a crypto accountant. I am skeptical that such a person exists that is not some sort of scam.

I am not sure that anyone can untangle this mess this mess right now. I am leaning towards just using the tax documents from the platforms that provided documents and not dealing with the Voyager account.

I believe the transfers between the accounts is where all the cost basis information went missing. I am just lost trying to figure this all out. Any advice would be much appreciated.",9,2022-04-13 19:43:56,30

As you can gather from the title, I just turned 18 and have accumulated a decent sum of money throughout my years of summer jobs and birthdays. I've been interested in crypto, more specifically Bitcoin, for a few years now.

I'm not sure how far $1000 can get you in the realm of crypto, but for the moment I believe this is a good starting point. ( Or not?) I am willing to invest more money after I  have a better understanding of crypto.

ADA,Bitcoin,2nd Layer POS layer for BTC,"Listen I know Proof Of Stake chains are total POS (Pieces of S)&*t). It seems like a very simple first principles argument against POS is that literally any government in the entire world could print currency, buy ADA or ETH or whatever other sheetcoin so that they would then have a controlling interest so they could mess up the network. Doesn’t stand up to attack from a non-economic actor like BTC does, and it’s basically a cyclical argument. If Eth has value when I stake it and I receive more Eth for staking that is great as long as Eth is worth something, but if Eth isn’t worth anything why do I care about getting more of it?

To me BTC has fundamental value because somebody paid 10’s of thousands of dollars to pull it out of cyberspace. Somebody valued $14,000 worth of energy less than they did a Bitcoin.

Now to BTC POS. Why couldn’t you have a second layer that was proof of stake but just-stake BTC? In a way I KINDA think of lightning like this, but also there’s some distinct advantages to what I’m saying. I think. Idk anything I’m just some pleb, discuss!",0,2021-07-30 01:05:59,25
ADA,Bitcoin,UK crypto tax help,"So, during the lockdown. I dove into crypto and started investing November 2020.

I have been swapping alt coins extensively. However, I did not know that swapping crypto to crypto was taxable. Which begs to my question. 

How do I pay that swap from crypto to crypto if I have no fiat funds to pay for that capital gain. I’m really confused how that works. Does it force me to cash it out to cover my costs for the tax.

From my understanding, The only thing I should pay for is that if I decide to convert my gains into GBP into a UK bank account (MONZO).

For example, from all my trades (swapping alt coins) I have only ever converted USDT to GBP/BTC/GBP and ADA/GBP to a total amount of £12,000. Which I thought was the free allowance.

I have not exceeded that in terms of withdrawal from Binance. Even though my current gains have grown, I have never exceeded to take profit over £12,000. Therefore, is there any point in declaring.

My understanding was that. I only ever have to declare if my cashout (Crypto to fiat into a bank account) if I go over the Capital Gains allowance. Which I haven’t. I just want to keep my bag growing. 

I don’t want to tax evade, I just want to know the proper way to do this. How can they expect me to pay for a crypto to crypto swap when I am not even benefiting from the gain because I’m just riding the percentages and not cashing it to GBP. 

I really just don’t understand how this works. Also, is it too late for me to declare such information.

Would funds like this be enough to build infrastructure to create hash rate higher than what the current BTC miners combined deliver? It's all theoretical, I know. But let's say they don't get regulation through since it requires deeper, democratic processes but they would rather decide to bring crypto down by actually forcefully out-mining everybody else, with the intent to make people lose trust in it.

Again, let's leave politics aside, I'm just curious about your guesses of how much fiat it would take to become the 51% miner and if for example 2trn would do the trick.

With ADA for example you can become the owner of 51% for a few tens of billions quite ""easily"" and boom PoS is hijacked. (Again just theoretical in order to compare the fiat it takes, I like and own ADA)",0,2021-10-03 08:28:41,15
ADA,Bitcoin,Is anyone else freaked out by this whole blocksize debate? Does anyone else find themself often agreeing with *both* sides - depending on whichever argument you happen to be reading at the moment? And do we need some better algorithms and data structures?,"**Why do both sides of the debate seem “right” to me?**

I know, I know, a healthy debate is healthy and all - and maybe I'm just not used to the tumult and jostling which would be inevitable in a real live open major debate about something as vital as Bitcoin.

And I really do agree with the starry-eyed idealists who say Bitcoin is *vital*. Imperfect as it may be, it certainly does seem to represent the first real chance we've had in the past few hundred years to try to steer our civilization and our planet away from the dead-ends and disasters which our government-issued debt-based currencies keep dragging us into.

But this particular debate, about the blocksize, doesn't seem to be getting resolved at all.

Pretty much every time I read one of the long-form major arguments contributed by Bitcoin ""thinkers"" who I've come to respect over the past few years, this weird thing happens: I usually end up finding myself nodding my head and *agreeing* with whatever particular piece I'm reading!

But that should be impossible - because a lot of these people vehemently disagree! 

So how can both sides sound so convincing to me, simply depending on whichever piece I *currently* happen to be reading?

Does anyone else feel this way? Or am I just a gullible idiot?

**Just Do It?**

When you first look at it or hear about it, increasing the size seems almost like a no-brainer: The ""big-block"" supporters say just increase the blocksize to 20 MB or 8 MB, or do some kind of scheduled or calculated regular increment which tries to take into account the capabilities of the infrastructure and the needs of the users. We do have the bandwidth and the memory to at least increase the blocksize now, they say - and we're probably gonna continue to have more bandwidth and memory in order to be able to keep increasing the blocksize for another couple decades - pretty much like everything else computer-based we've seen over the years (some of this stuff is called by names such as ""Moore's Law"").

On the other hand, whenever the ""small-block"" supporters warn about the utter catastrophe that a failed hard-fork would mean, I get totally freaked by their possible doomsday scenarios, which seem totally plausible and terrifying - so I end up feeling that the only way I'd want to go with a hard-fork would be if there was some pre-agreed ""triggering"" mechanism where the fork itself would only actually ""switch on"" and take effect provided that some ""supermajority"" of the network (of who? the miners? the full nodes?) had signaled (presumably via some kind of totally reliable p2p trustless software-based voting system?) that they do indeed ""pre-agree"" to actually adopt the pre-scheduled fork (and thereby avoid *any* possibility whatsoever of the precious blockchain somehow tragically splitting into two and pretty much killing this cryptocurrency off in its infancy). 

So in this ""conservative"" scenario, I'm talking about wanting at least 95% pre-adoption agreement - not the mere 75% which I recall some proposals call for, which seems like it could easily lead to a 75/25 blockchain split.

But this time, with this long drawn-out blocksize debate, the core devs, and several other important voices who have become prominent opinion shapers over the past few years, can't seem to come to any real agreement on this.

**Weird split among the devs**

As far as I can see, there's this weird split: Gavin and Mike seem to be the only people among the devs who really want a major blocksize increase - and all the other devs seem to be vehemently against them. 

But then on the other hand, the *users* seem to be overwhelmingly in favor of a major increase. 

And there are meta-questions about governance, about about why this didn't come out as a BIP, and what the availability of Bitcoin XT means.

And today or yesterday there was this really cool big-blockian exponential graph based on doubling the blocksize every two years for twenty years, reminding us of the pure *mathematical* fact that 2^10 is indeed about 1000 - but not really addressing any of the *game-theoretic* points raised by the small-blockians. So a lot of the users seem to like it, but when so few devs say anything positive about it, I worry: is this just yet more exponential chart porn?

On the one hand, Gavin's and Mike's blocksize increase proposal initially seemed like a no-brainer to me.

And on the other hand, all the other devs seem to be against them. Which is weird - not what I'd initially expected at all (but maybe I'm just a fool who's seduced by exponential chart porn?). 

Look, I don't mean to be rude to any of the core devs, and I don't want to come off like someone wearing a tinfoil hat - but it has to cross people's minds that the powers that be (the Fed and the other central banks and the governments that use their debt-issued money to run this world into a ditch) could very well be much more scared shitless than they're letting on. If we assume that the powers that be are using their usual playbook and tactics, then it could be worth looking at the book ""Confessions of an Economic Hitman"" by John Perkins, to get an idea of how they might try to attack Bitcoin. So, what I'm saying is, they do have a track record of sending in ""experts"" to try to derail projects and keep everyone enslaved to the Creature from Jekyll Island. I'm just saying. So, without getting ad hominem - let's just make sure that our ideas can really stand scrutiny on their own - as Nick Szabo says, we need to make sure there is ""more computer science, less noise"" in this debate. 

When Gavin Andresen first came out with the 20 MB thing - I sat back and tried to imagine if I could download 20 MB in 10 minutes (which seems to be one of the basic mathematical and technological constraints here - right?) 

I figured, ""Yeah, I could download that"" - even with my crappy internet connection.

And I guess the telecoms *might* be nice enough to continue to double our bandwidth every two years for the next couple decades – if we ask them politely?

On the other hand - I think we should be careful about entrusting the financial freedom of the world into the greedy hands of the telecoms companies - given all their shady shenanigans over the past few years in many countries. After decades of the MPAA and the FBI trying to chip away at BitTorrent, lately PirateBay has been hard to access. I would say it's quite likely that certain persons at institutions like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs and the Fed might be very, very motivated to see Bitcoin fail - so we shouldn't be too sure about scaling plans which depend on the willingness of companies Verizon and AT&T to double our bandwith every two years. 

**Maybe the real important hardware buildout challenge for a company like 21 (and its allies such as Qualcomm) to take on now would not be ""a miner in every toaster"" but rather ""Google Fiber Download and Upload Speeds in every Country, including China"".**

I think I've read all the major stuff on the blocksize debate from Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd, Adam Back, and Jeff Garzick and several other major contributors - and, oddly enough, *all* their arguments seem reasonable - heck even Luke-Jr seems reasonable to me on the blocksize debate, and I always thought he was a whackjob overly influenced by superstition and numerology - and now today I'm reading the article by Bram Cohen - the inventor of BitTorrent - and I find myself agreeing with him too!

I say to myself: What's going on with me? How can I possibly agree with *all* of these guys, if they all have such vehemently opposing viewpoints?

I mean, think back to the glory days of a couple of years ago, when all we were hearing was how this amazing unprecedented grassroots innovation called Bitcoin was going to benefit everyone from all walks of life, all around the world: 

- wealthy individuals trying to preserve and transport their wealth across space and across time

- iPhone and Android users who want to buy a latte on their smartphone at Starbucks 

- Venezuelans and Argentinians and Cypriots and Russian oligarchs and Greeks and anyone else whose state-backed currency sucks 

- unbanked Africans who will someday be texting around money via SMS messages on their cellphones 

- online content providers who will finally be able to get paid via micropayments

- smart contracts and stock brokering and lawyering and land deeding and the refrigerator calling out to order more milk and distributed anonymous corporations (DACs) automatically negotiating and adjusting driverless taxicab fares in the Uber-future of the Internet of Things

...basically the entire human race transacting everything into the blockchain.

(Although let me say that I think that people's focus on ideas like driverless cabs creating realtime fare markets based on supply and demand seems to be setting our sights a bit low as far as Bitcoin's abilities to correct the financial world's capital-misallocation problems which seem to have been made possible by infinite debt-based fiat. I would have hoped that a Bitcoin-based economy would solve much more noble, much more urgent capital-allocation problems than driverless taxicabs creating fare markets or refrigerators ordering milk on the internet of things. I was thinking more along the lines that Bitcoin would finally strangle dead-end debt-based deadly-toxic energy industries like fossil fuels and let profitable clean energy industries like Thorium LFTRs take over - but that's another topic. :=)

**Paradoxes in the blocksize debate**

Let me summarize the major paradoxes I see here:

(1) Regarding the people (the majority of the core devs) who are *against* a blocksize increase: Well, the small-blocks arguments do seem kinda weird, and certainly not very ""populist"", in the sense that: When on earth have end-users ever heard of a computer technology whose capacity didn't grow pretty much exponentially year-on-year? All the cool new technology we've had - from hard drives to RAM to bandwidth - started out pathetically tiny and grew to unimaginably huge over the past few decades - and all our software has in turn gotten massively powerful and big and complex (sometimes bloated) to take advantage of the enormous new capacity available. 

But now suddenly, for the first time in the history of technology, we seem to have a majority of the devs, on a major *p2p* project - saying: ""Let's not scale the system up. It could be dangerous. It might break the whole system (if the hard-fork fails).""

I don't know, maybe I'm missing something here, maybe someone else could enlighten me, but I don't think I've ever seen this sort of thing happen in the last few decades of the history of technology - devs arguing *against* scaling up p2p technology to take advantage of expected growth in infrastructure capacity.

(2) But... on the other hand... the dire warnings of the small-blockians about what could happen if a hard-fork were to *fail* - wow, they do seem really dire! And these guys are pretty much all heavyweight, experienced programmers and/or game theorists and/or p2p open-source project managers. 

I must say, that nearly all of the long-form arguments I've read - as well as many, many of the shorter comments I've read from many users in the threads, whose names I at least have come to more-or-less recognize over the past few months and years on reddit and bitcointalk - have been amazingly impressive in their ability to analyze all aspects of the lifecycle and management of open-source software projects, bringing up lots of serious points which I could never have come up with, and which seem to come from long experience with programming and project management - as well as dealing with economics and human nature (eg, greed - the game-theory stuff). 

So a lot of really smart and experienced people with major expertise in various areas ranging from programming to management to game theory to politics to economics have been making some serious, mature, compelling arguments. 

But, as I've been saying, the only problem to me is: in many of these cases, these arguments are vehemently in opposition to each other! So I find myself agreeing with pretty much all of them, one by one - which means the end result is just a giant contradiction.

I mean, today we have Bram Cohen, the inventor of BitTorrent, arguing (quite cogently and convincingly to me), that it would be dangerous to increase the blocksize. And this seems to be a guy who would know a few things about scaling out a massive global p2p network - since the protocol which he invented, BitTorrent, is now apparently responsible for like a third of the traffic on the internet (and this despite the long-term concerted efforts of major evil players such as the MPAA and the FBI to shut the whole thing down).

**Was the BitTorrent analogy too ""glib""?**

By the way - I would like to go on a slight tangent here and say that one of the main reasons why I felt so ""comfortable"" jumping on the Bitcoin train back a few years ago, when I first heard about it and got into it, was the whole rough analogy I saw with BitTorrent. 

I remembered the perhaps paradoxical fact that when a torrent is *more* popular (eg, a major movie release that just came out last week), then it actually becomes *faster* to download. More people want it, so more people have a few pieces of it, so more people are able to get it from each other. A kind of self-correcting economic feedback loop, where more demand directly leads to more supply.

(BitTorrent manages to pull this off by essentially adding a certain structure to the file being shared, so that it's not simply like an append-only *list* of 1 MB blocks, but rather more like an random-access or indexed *array* of 1 MB chunks. Say you're downloading a film which is 700 MB. As soon as your ""client"" program has downloaded a single 1-MB chunk - say chunk #99 - your ""client"" program instantly turns into a ""server"" program as well - offering that chunk #99 to other clients. From my simplistic understanding, I believe the Bitcoin protocol does something similar, to provide a p2p architecture. Hence my - perhaps naïve - assumption that Bitcoin already had the right algorithms / architecture / data structure to scale.)

The efficiency of the BitTorrent network seemed to jive with that ""network law"" (Metcalfe's Law?) about fax machines. This law states that the more fax machines there are, the more valuable the network of fax machines becomes. Or the value of the network grows on the order of the square of the number of nodes. 

This is in contrast with other technology like cars, where the *more* you have, the *worse* things get. The more cars there are, the more traffic jams you have, so things start going downhill. I guess this is because highway space is limited - after all, we can't pave over the entire countryside, and we never did get those flying cars we were promised, as David Graeber laments in a recent essay in The Baffler magazine :-) 

And regarding the ""stress test"" supposedly happening right now in the middle of this ongoing blocksize debate, I don't know what worries me more: the fact that it apparently is taking only $5,000 to do a simple kind of DoS on the blockchain - or the fact that there are a few rumors swirling around saying that the unknown company doing the stress test shares the same physical mailing address with a ""scam"" company?

Or maybe we should just be worried that so much of this debate is happening on a handful of forums which are controlled by some guy named theymos who's already engaged in some pretty ""contentious"" or ""controversial"" behavior like blowing a million dollars on writing forum software (I guess he never heard that reddit.com software is open-source)?

So I worry that the great promise of ""decentralization"" might be more fragile than we originally thought. 

**Scaling**

Anyways, back to Metcalfe's Law: with virtual stuff, like torrents and fax machines, the more the merrier. The more people downloading a given movie, the faster it arrives - and the more people own fax machines, the more valuable the overall fax network.

So I kindof (naïvely?) assumed that Bitcoin, being ""virtual"" and p2p, would somehow scale up the same magical way BitTorrrent did. I just figured that more people using it would somehow automatically make it stronger and faster.

But now a lot of devs have started talking in terms of the old ""scarcity"" paradigm, talking about blockspace being a ""scarce resource"" and talking about ""fee markets"" - which seems kinda scary, and antithetical to much of the earlier rhetoric we heard about Bitcoin (the stuff about supporting our favorite creators with micropayments, and the stuff about Africans using SMS to send around payments).

Look, when some asshole is in line in front of you at the cash register and he's holding up the line so they can run his *credit card* to buy a bag of Cheeto's, we tend to get pissed off at the guy - clogging up our expensive global electronic payment infrastructure to make a two-dollar purchase. And that's on a fairly efficient centralized system - and presumably after a year or so, VISA and the guy's bank can delete or compress the transaction in their SQL databases.

Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but if some guy buys a coffee on the blockchain, or if somebody pays an online artist $1.99 for their work - then that transaction, a few bytes or so, has to live on the blockchain forever? 

Or is there some ""pruning"" thing that gets rid of it after a while?

And this could lead to another question: Viewed from the perspective of double-entry bookkeeping, is the blockchain ""world-wide ledger"" more like the ""balance sheet"" part of accounting, i.e. a *snapshot* showing *current* assets and liabilities? Or is it more like the ""cash flow"" part of accounting, i.e. a *journal* showing *historical* revenues and expenses?

When I think of thousands of machines around the globe having to lug around multiple identical copies of a multi-gigabyte file containing some asshole's coffee purchase forever and ever... I feel like I'm ideologically drifting in one direction (where I'd end up also being against really cool stuff like online micropayments and Africans banking via SMS)... so I don't want to go there. 

But on the other hand, when really experienced and battle-tested veterans with major experience in the world of open-souce programming and project management (the ""small-blockians"") warn of the catastrophic consequences of a possible failed hard-fork, I get freaked out and I wonder if Bitcoin really was destined to be a settlement layer for big transactions.

**Could the original programmer(s) possibly weigh in?**

And I don't mean to appeal to authority - but heck, where the hell is Satoshi Nakamoto in all this? I do understand that he/she/they would want to maintain absolute anonymity - but on the other hand, I assume SN wants Bitcoin to succeed (both for the future of humanity - or at least for all the bitcoins SN allegedly holds :-) - and I understand there is a way that SN can cryptographically sign a message - and I understand that as the original developer of Bitcoin, SN had some very specific opinions about the blocksize... So I'm kinda wondering of Satoshi could weigh in from time to time. Just to help out a bit. I'm not saying ""Show us a sign"" like a deity or something - but damn it sure would be fascinating and possibly very helpful if Satoshi gave us his/her/their 2 satoshis worth at this really confusing juncture.

**Are we using our capacity wisely?**

I'm not a programming or game-theory whiz, I'm just a casual user who has tried to keep up with technology over the years. 

It just seems weird to me that here we have this massive supercomputer (500 times more powerful than the all the supercomputers in the world combined) doing fairly straightforward ""embarassingly parallel"" number-crunching operations to secure a p2p world-wide ledger called the blockchain to keep track of a measly 2.1 quadrillion tokens spread out among a few billion addresses - and a couple of years ago you had people like Rick Falkvinge saying the blockchain would someday be supporting multi-million-dollar letters of credit for international trade and you had people like Andreas Antonopoulos saying the blockchain would someday allow billions of ""unbanked"" people to send remittances around the village or around the world dirt-cheap - and now suddenly in June 2015 we're talking about blockspace as a ""scarce resource"" and talking about ""fee markets"" and partially centralized, corporate-sponsored ""Level 2"" vaporware like Lightning Network and some mysterious company is ""stess testing"" or ""DoS-ing"" the system by throwing away a measly $5,000 and suddenly it sounds like the whole system could eventually head right back into PayPal and Western Union territory again, in terms of expensive fees.

When I got into Bitcoin, I really was heavily influenced by vague analogies with BitTorrent: I figured everyone would just have tiny little like utorrent-type program running on their machine (ie, Bitcoin-QT or Armory or Mycelium etc.). 

I figured that just like anyone can host a their own blog or webserver, anyone would be able to host their own bank. 

Yeah, Google and and Mozilla and Twitter and Facebook and WhatsApp did come along and build stuff on top of TCP/IP, so I did expect a bunch of companies to build layers on top of the Bitcoin protocol as well. But I still figured the basic unit of bitcoin client software powering the overall system would be small and personal and affordable and p2p - like a bittorrent client - or at the most, like a cheap server hosting a blog or email server.

And I figured there would be a way at the software level, at the architecture level, at the algorithmic level, at the data structure level - to let the thing scale - if not infinitely, at least fairly massively and gracefully - the same way the BitTorrent network has. 

Of course, I do also understand that with BitTorrent, you're sharing a read-only object (eg, a movie) - whereas with Bitcoin, you're achieving distributed trustless consensus and appending it to a write-only (or append-only) database.

So I do understand that the problem which BitTorrent solves is much simpler than the problem which Bitcoin sets out to solve.

But still, it seems that there's *got* to be a way to make this thing scale. It's p2p and it's got 500 times more computing power than all the supercomputers in the world combined - and so many brilliant and motivated and inspired people want this thing to succeed! And Bitcoin could be our civilization's last chance to steer away from the oncoming debt-based ditch of disaster we seem to be driving into!

It just seems that Bitcoin has *got* to be able to scale somehow - and all these smart people working together should be able to come up with a solution which pretty much everyone can agree - in advance - *will* work. 

Right? Right?


**A (probably irrelevant) tangent on algorithms and architecture and data structures**

I'll finally weigh with my personal perspective - although I might be biased due to my background (which is more on the theoretical side of computer science).

My own modest - or perhaps radical - suggestion would be to ask whether we're really looking at all the best possible algorithms and architectures and data structures out there. 

From this perspective, I sometimes worry that the overwhelming majority of the great minds working on the programming and game-theory stuff might come from a rather specific, shall we say ""von Neumann"" or ""procedural"" or ""imperative"" school of programming (ie, C and Python and Java programmers). 

It seems strange to me that such a cutting-edge and important computer project would have so little participation from the great minds at the *other* end of the spectrum of programming paradigms - namely, the ""functional"" and ""declarative"" and ""algebraic"" (and co-algebraic!) worlds. 

For example, I was struck in particular by statements I've seen here and there (which seemed rather hubristic or lackadaisical to me - for something as important as *Bitcoin*), that the *specification* of Bitcoin and the blockchain doesn't really exist in any form other than the reference *implementation(s)* (in *procedural* languages such as C or Python?).

**Curry-Howard anyone?**

I mean, many computer scientists are aware of the Curry-Howard isomorophism, which basically says that the relationship between a theorem and its proof is equivalent to the relationship between a specification and its implementation. In other words, there is a long tradition in mathematics (and in computer programming) of:

- separating the compact (and easy-to-check) statement of a theorem from the messy (and hard-to-check) details of its proof(s);

- separating the specification of a system from its implementation(s); and

- being able to *prove* that an implementation does indeed satisfy its specification. 

And it's not exactly ""turtles all the way down"" either: a specification is generally simple and compact enough that a good programmer can usually simply visually inspect it to determine if it is indeed ""correct"" - something which is very difficult, if not impossible, to do with a program written in a procedural, implementation-oriented language such as C or Python or Java.

So I worry that we've got this tradition, from the open-source github C/Java programming tradition, of never actually writing our ""specification"", and only writing the ""implementation"". In mission-critical military-grade programming projects (which often use languages like Ada or Maude) this is simply not allowed. It would seem that a project as mission-critical as Bitcoin - which could literally be crucial for humanity's continued survival - should also use this kind of military-grade software development approach.

And I'm not saying rewrite the implementations in these kind of theoretical languages. But it might be helpful if the C/Python/Java programmers in the Bitcoin imperative programming world could build some bridges to the Maude/Haskell/ML programmers of the functional and algebraic programming worlds to see if any kind of useful cross-pollination might take place - between specifications and implementations.

For example, the JavaFAN formal analyzer for multi-threaded Java programs (developed using tools based on the Maude language) was applied to the Remote Agent AI program aboard NASA's Deep Space 1 shuttle, written in Java - and it took only a few minutes using formal mathematical reasoning to detect a potential deadlock which would have occurred years later during the space mission when the damn spacecraft was already way out around Pluto.

And ""the Maude-NRL (Naval Research Laboratory) Protocol Analyzer (Maude-NPA) is a tool used to provide security proofs of cryptographic protocols and to search for protocol flaws and cryptosystem attacks.""

These are open-source formal reasoning tools developed by DARPA and used by NASA and the US Navy to ensure that program implementations satisfy their specifications. It would be great if some of the people involved in these kinds of projects could contribute to help ensure the security and scalability of Bitcoin.

But there is a wide abyss between the kinds of programmers who use languages like Maude and the kinds of programmers who use languages like C/Python/Java - and it can be really hard to get the two worlds to meet. There is a bit of rapprochement between these language communities in languages which might be considered as being somewhere in the middle, such as Haskell and ML. I just worry that Bitcoin might be turning into being an exclusively C/Python/Java project (with the algorithms and practitioners traditionally of that community), when it could be more advantageous if it also had some people from the functional and algebraic-specification and program-verification community involved as well. The thing is, though: the theoretical practitioners are big on ""semantics"" - I've heard them say stuff like ""Yes but a C / C++ program has no easily identifiable semantics"". So to get them involved, you really have to first be able to talk about *what* your program does (specification) - before proceeding to describe *how* it does it (implementation). And writing high-level specifications is typically very hard using the syntax and semantics of languages like C and Java and Python - whereas specs are fairly easy to write in Maude - and not only that, they're executable, and you state and verify properties about them - which provides for the kind of debate Nick Szabo was advocating (""more computer science, less noise""). 

**Imagine if we had an *executable algebraic specification of Bitcoin in Maude*, where we could formally reason about and verify certain crucial game-theoretical properties - rather than merely hand-waving and arguing and deploying and praying.**

And so in the theoretical programming community you've got major research on various logics such as Girard's Linear Logic (which is resource-conscious) and Bruni and Montanari's Tile Logic (which enables ""pasting"" bigger systems together from smaller ones in space and time), and executable algebraic specification languages such as Meseguer's Maude (which would be perfect for game theory modeling, with its functional modules for specifying the deterministic parts of systems and its system modules for specifiying non-deterministic parts of systems, and its parameterized skeletons for sketching out the typical architectures of mobile systems, and its formal reasoning and verification tools and libraries which have been specifically applied to testing and breaking - and fixing - cryptographic protocols).

And somewhat closer to the practical hands-on world, you've got stuff like Google's MapReduce and lots of Big Data database languages developed by Google as well. And yet here we are with a mempool growing dangerously big for RAM on a single machine, and a 20-GB append-only list as our database - and not much debate on practical results from Google's Big Data databases. 

(And by the way: maybe I'm totally ignorant for asking this, but I'll ask anyways: why the hell does the mempool have to stay in RAM? Couldn't it work just as well if it were stored temporarily on the hard drive?)

And you've got CalvinDB out of Yale which apparently provides an ACID layer on top of a massively distributed database.

Look, I'm just an armchair follower cheering on these projects. I can barely manage to write a query in SQL, or read through a C or Python or Java program. But I would argue two points here: (1) these languages may be too low-level and ""non-formal"" for writing and modeling and formally reasoning about and proving properties of mission-critical *specifications* - and (2) there seem to be some Big Data tools already deployed by institutions such as Google and Yale which support global petabyte-size databases on commodity boxes with nice properties such as near-real-time and ACID - and I sometimes worry that the ""core devs"" might be failing to review the literature (and reach out to fellow programmers) out there to see if there might be some formal program-verification and practical Big Data tools out there which could be applied to coming up with rock-solid, 100% consensus proposals to handle an issue such as blocksize scaling, which seems to have become much more intractable than many people might have expected. 

I mean, the protocol solved the hard stuff: the elliptical-curve stuff and the Byzantine General stuff. How the heck can we be falling down on the comparatively ""easier"" stuff - like scaling the blocksize? 

It just seems like defeatism to say ""Well, the blockchain is already 20-30 GB and it's gonna be 20-30 TB ten years from now - and we need 10 Mbs bandwidth now and 10,000 Mbs bandwidth 20 years from - assuming the evil Verizon and AT&T actually give us that - so let's just become a settlement platform and give up on buying coffee or banking the unbanked or doing micropayments, and let's push all that stuff into some corporate-controlled vaporware without even a whitepaper yet.""

So you've got Peter Todd doing some possibly brilliant theorizing and extrapolating on the idea of ""treechains"" - there is a Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast from about a year ago where he sketches the rough outlines of this idea out in a very inspiring, high-level way - although the specifics have yet to be hammered out. And we've got Blockstream also doing some hopeful hand-waving about the Lightning Network.

Things like Peter Todd's treechains - which may be similar to the spark in some devs' eyes called Lightning Network - are examples of the kind of algorithm or architecture which *might* manage to harness the massive computing power of miners and nodes in such a way that certain kinds of massive and graceful scaling become possible. 

It just seems like a kindof tiny dev community working on this stuff. 

**Being a C or Python or Java programmer should not be a pre-req to being able to help contribute to the specification (and formal reasoning and program verification) for Bitcoin and the blockchain.** 

XML and UML are crap modeling and specification languages, and C and Java and Python are even worse (as *specification* languages - although as *implementation* languages, they are of course fine).

But there *are* serious modeling and specification languages out there, and they could be very helpful at times like this - where what we're dealing with is questions of modeling and specification (ie, ""needs and requirements""). 

One just doesn't often see the practical, hands-on world of open-source github implementation-level programmers and the academic, theoretical world of specification-level programmers meeting very often. I wish there were some way to get these two worlds to collaborate on Bitcoin. 

Maybe a good first step to reach out to the theoretical people would be to provide a modular executable algebraic specification of the Bitcoin protocol in a recognized, military/NASA-grade specification language such as Maude - because that's something the theoretical community can actually wrap their heads around, whereas it's very hard to get them to pay attention to something written *only* as a C / Python / Java implementation (without an accompanying specification in a  formal language). 

They can't check whether the program does what it's supposed to do - if you don't provide a formal mathematical definition of what the program is supposed to do.


**Specification : Implementation :: Theorem : Proof**

You have to remember: the theoretical community is *very* aware of the Curry-Howard isomorphism. Just like it would be hard to get a mathematician's attention by merely showing them a *proof* without telling also telling them what *theorem* the proof is proving - by the same token, it's hard to get the attention of a theoretical computer scientist by merely showing them an *implementation* without showing them the *specification* that it implements.

Bitcoin is currently confronted with a mathematical or ""computer science"" problem: how to secure the network while getting high enough transactional throughput, while staying within the limited RAM, bandwidth and hard drive space limitations of current and future infrastructure. 

**The problem only becomes a *political and economic* problem if we give up on trying to solve it as a *mathematical and ""theoretical computer science""* problem.**

There should be a plethora of whitepapers out now proposing algorithmic solutions to these scaling issues. Remember, all we have to do is apply the Byzantine General consensus-reaching procedure to a worldwide database which shuffles 2.1 quadrillion tokens among a few billion addresses. The 21 company has emphatically pointed out that racing to compute a hash to add a block is an ""embarrassingly parallel"" problem - very easy to decompose among cheap, fault-prone, commodity boxes, and recompose into an overall solution - along the lines of Google's highly successful MapReduce.

I guess what I'm really saying is (and I don't mean to be rude here), is that C and Python and Java programmers might not be the best qualified people to develop and formally prove the correctness of (note I do not say: ""test"", I say ""formally prove the correctness of"") these kinds of algorithms.

I really believe in the importance of getting the algorithms and architectures right - look at Google Search itself, it uses some pretty brilliant algorithms and architectures (eg, MapReduce, Paxos) which enable it to achieve amazing performance - on pretty crappy commodity hardware. And look at BitTorrent, which is truly p2p, where more demand leads to more supply. 

So, in this vein, I will close this lengthy rant with an oddly specific link - which may or may not be able to make some interesting contributions to finding suitable algorithms, architectures and data structures which might help Bitcoin scale massively. I have no idea if this link could be helpful - but given the near-total lack of people from the Haskell and ML and functional worlds in these Bitcoin specification debates, I thought I'd be remiss if I didn't throw this out - just in case there might be something here which could help us channel the massive computing power of the Bitcoin network in such a way as to enable us simply sidestep this kind of desperate debate where both sides seem right because the other side seems wrong.

https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/neil.ghani/papers/ghani-calco07

The above paper is about ""higher dimensional trees"". It uses a bit of category theory (not a whole lot) and a bit of Haskell (again not a lot - just a simple data structure called a Rose tree, which has a wikipedia page) to develop a very expressive and efficient data structure which generalizes from lists to trees to higher dimensions.

I have no idea if this kind of data structure could be applicable to the current scaling mess we apparently are getting bogged down in - I don't have the game-theory skills to figure it out. 

I just thought that since the blockchain is like a list, and since there are some tree-like structures which have been grafted on for efficiency (eg Merkle trees) and since many of the futuristic scaling proposals seem to also involve generalizing from list-like structures (eg, the blockchain) to tree-like structures (eg, side-chains and tree-chains)... well, who knows, there might be some nugget of algorithmic or architectural or data-structure inspiration there. 

**So... TL;DR:**

(1) I'm freaked out that this blocksize debate has splintered the community so badly and dragged on so long, with no resolution in sight, and both sides seeming so right (because the other side seems so wrong).

(2) I think Bitcoin could gain immensely by using high-level formal, algebraic and co-algebraic program specification and verification languages (such as Maude including Maude-NPA, Mobile Maude parameterized skeletons, etc.) to specify (and possibly also, to some degree, verify) *what* Bitcoin does - before translating to low-level *implementation* languages such as C and Python and Java saying *how* Bitcoin does it. This would help to communicate and reason about programs with much more mathematical certitude - and possibly obviate the need for many political and economic tradeoffs which currently seem dismally inevitable - and possibly widen the collaboration on this project.

(3) I wonder if there are some Big Data approaches out there (eg, along the lines of Google's MapReduce and BigTable, or Yale's CalvinDB), which could be implemented to allow Bitcoin to scale massively and painlessly - and to satisfy all stakeholders, ranging from millionaires to micropayments, coffee drinkers to the great ""unbanked"".

ADA,Bitcoin,How I possibly lost my crypto forever,"I’m typing this out for those who are in the crypto space or thinking about it. This is a true story and I would advise everyone to take note and don’t mess up like myself. 

In 2017 I learned so much about crypto from the homie so I did my due diligence and went ahead and bought some via coinbase shortly after. In total I’ve probably put in 1500-2500 into it with money that I didn’t miss in case it went bust. I bought in when btc was at its highest at the time. I think it was 6-7k per coin. So I tried my hand at trading but it was too much work as I wanted something more passive. So when the Bread wallet ICO dropped I took in some of those coins and eventually moved my crypto from binance and coinbase to my Bread wallet. They give you 12 words that you type in case you need to recover the wallet so I type those in my phone and let my crypto bubble. Now I will add that I had an iPhone 7 with thumbprint ID and that is how I opened my wallets.

To the people that decided to hodl in 2018 there was a blood bath. My wallet lost a ton a value so I decided to focus my crypto into 4-5 coins and bought a ton of Cardano and Stellar lumen. I copped over 1000 of each. Over the last 6 months I’ve noticed ADA is getting more popular and starting to rise so my portfolio is looking nice again. In December I decided to get the exodus wallet because it supported the ADA coin as Binance said they wouldn’t service the US anymore. They gave me a 12 phrase key as well and I put those in my phone. 

Now fast fwd to last week, I try to unlock my phone but my thumbprint won’t work because it had been too long since I checked it. (It was overnight) I go to type in my 6 digit iPhone password just to open my phone and it says it’s wrong. Confused I keep trying and I keep getting denied. I’m not too worried at that point but eventually I disable my iPhone by trying the password too many times. Fuck it this is an iPhone 7 I’ll go ahead and upgrade to a newer joint. I get the 11 and I setup my cloud and start getting my apps back from my previous phone. I download both the bread and exodus wallets and it’s time to put in the 12 phrase key. Now this is where I fucked up initially. So my iPhone users know about the Notes app and that is where I typed out my 2 12 key phrases to access my wallets. The fucked up part is I locked the note with my passwords with my thumbprint and the new iPhones no longer have the thumbprint. It’s asking me for my password to type out but I don’t ever remember typing in a password. I’ve tried all week to remember the password and it’s not coming to me at all. 

There is a silver lining tho so the BRD wallet I opened back in 2017 I wrote those keys on a piece of paper and found it. That wallet was worth more than the Exodus wallet. But the exodus has all of my cardano and if that ever goes to $100 a coin then I’d be sick but I got something back. If you’ve read this far I appreciate it. So to the rookies if you get a digital wallet then make sure you write your keys down and put them in your phone. Leave yourself multiple ways to recover if possible! Now I need to cop some ADA while it’s still low and start over.",5,2021-03-12 16:35:24,17
ADA,Bitcoin,Where are you buying and storing your coins?,I bought some on Cash App and holding it in Green Wallet but I'm wondering if this is the best way to do it or what d you guys recommend?,7,2021-02-15 04:29:00,17
ADA,Bitcoin,Is the world really ready for crypto currency?,"I recently thought about ways to invest my money and i kind of stumbled into the whole cryptocurrency rabbit hole. And what can i say, i am rather an it-nerd nor an actual computer scientist but even i think that this stuff means true power to the people. But power means also responsibility, in this case 100% responsibility for managing your own money. I am not sure if the average person is able to do this, especially saving themselves from the whole spectrum of frauds and scams. Because once your money its gone, it is gone.

As the price goes up miners will sell at a profit in Fiat.  If the price goes down miners will believe it is undervalued and will hold because they know the minimum that they paid for the coin.

With POS there is no immediate price tag for the coins.  Someone sold the coins to you at a price based on speculation and not natural resources(POWER) and technology(mining equipment).  Or the POS coins were air dropped or Pre-mined in which case they still start with a value based purely on speculation.

With other configurations of consensus the Network has either: 

1 Based value on something arbitrary or unpredictable

2 Not yet been Decentralized

&#x200B;

3 Based on Voting.

*Amir:*

Thank you for having me here.

I believe that ideas play an important role in shaping human history. What I want to talk about is how technology has been shaped by key ideas. In particular how certain mechanical ideas of human society got mixed up with with politics and technology.

What I want to talk about is the free technology movement. It was a movement that showed great potential promise to liberate humanity. At the heart of it was a idea that technology offered a new way to construct a radially different kind of society that never before was possible in history, this movement was influenced by the visions of early scientists who believed in the power of computer technology not just to serve large industry and military but everybody to have access to this new power.

Influenced of by the 60s counterculture, this movement went on to develop the first personal computers. But that's not the end of the story because this radical vision mutated into the idea of self-regulating systems which see human beings as object managed by computer algorithms. In this vision, the value of human ideas to transform the world was diminished into a strange kind of consensus where everybody satisfies their personal desires.

We now find ourselves in a strange static dreamworld while dark forces are returning to threaten to penetrate our reality and all of the dreams of the techno-utopiasts play the role in creating this fake virtual world in which human beings driven by desires, devoid of all sense of higher purpose become slaves to algorithms and vast computer intelligences.

What is interesting about this story is the significance it has for Bitcoin. A project which is created for the purpose of creating a decentralized peer-to-peer money that cannot be controlled by governments and central banks but which now finds itself monopolized by large mining cartels. A lack of vision to guide the project forwards and increasing irrelevance in a world facing a global breakup of power.

Lastly I want to explain my project to revitalize the free technology movement to formulate a wider vision to restore back the potential of the technology to transform human society and train the next generation of revolutionary hackers dedicated to the cause of using the technology to support the cause of freedom.

My aim here is to find sponsors, find the place for establishing our hacker Academy, to find partner organisations to develop new technology projects with and to find people ready to dedicate themselves in advancing the free technology movement. People ready to be at the forefront of writing history.

--

At the heart of this story lies a conflict between two men in 1968. One of them is good B.F. Skinner, the other is good Lewis Mumford. It was one moment when two ideas about how technology could be used to advance human society first XXX ((unintelligible)) to take hold.

There's a documentary from this time made in mid-60s called ""Towards tomorrow"". And in this documentary, it described two possible future visions for human society. In a society where old forms of authority were declining, what would be the way that we could organize masses of human beings in a future society.

One of these visions for this society was a world managed by an elite group of technocrats, a specialized elite who managed a large population of passive human beings who constantly needed to be monitored and managed to be able to to keep them happy. B.F. Skinner described a new way of controlling and ordering people. He posed the question in this age of mass democracy and individualism the old forms of coercion was simply not possible and he put forth the idea of using reward. And he described an experiment where you have a cage with a pigeon inside and the pigeon can be trained to peck symbols, buttons, and depending on which symbol they peck, they get a pellet of food. In this way, by giving the pigeons the right reward for the correct behavior, they train the pigeon as a mechanical object.

He then took this farther and he went to a mental hospital in San Bernardino in California and in the mental hospital, what they did is they gave the mental patients small reward every time they did a good behavior. With this reward, when it was a lunch time or a dinner time, the patients could sit at a nicer table. So, inside the mental hospital, they created a new ordered hierarchy from a system of reward in which people don't feel controlled but feel empowered. Skinner describes this model as a model for the future of humanity. What's really interesting about this video by Skinner is it there's something very eerily similar to what we see today in which there is a technocratic elite that has interest in politics only in managing human society to keep us happy to keep everything stable and to keep themselves rich. A lot of this was powered in the mid-80s with the fake consumer credit to reward us as a form of social management - much like the experiment with the hospital, the mental hospital.

Lewis Mumford put forward an alternative vision for a society. In this video I'm going to show you - he first criticises Skinner and then he puts forward an alternative vision where everybody in the society is a participant. Everybody is an active human being deciding their destiny.

<video - Lewis Mumford>
Skinner has a very ingenious way of making a system of highly compulsive organization seem as if it were very humane one. This is his great and original contribution. The old-fashioned mechanical collectives, the mega-machines as I call them, were brutal. They used punishment as a way of enforcing conformity. Skinner and the psychological school that he represents, have found much better system than punishment. They first tried it out on animals and now they are applying on human beings - reward them - make them exactly what you want them to do without the whip - but with some form of sugar-coated drug or candy which will make them think that they actually enjoying every moment of it. This is the most dangerous of all systems of compulsion that's why I regard Skinner's Walden 2 as another name for hell. And it would be the worst hell because we would not recognize we were there, we would imagine we are still in heaven.

Most of the reactions that have taken place in art including those that come on ahead of the beatniks and the hippies, have some underlying sense in the reaction itself, but the remedy is the part of the disease. The remedy in fact makes it easier for the institutions that have now the hold upon us to be even more compulsive, to be even more effective than ever before, if we don't care, if we drop out. If we lose ourselves in some insane fantasy of some kind - whether a natural fantasy of the neurotic or the chemically induced fantasy of someone who takes drugs - we lose our possibility of restoring our own autonomy of taking charge of our life because this requires greater energy, greater effort than that which is required to live through the daily life of a machine worker. We have to become fully fully activated human beings, every part of us tremendously alive and ready to take charge and this can't be done by people who are in an escape, by people who are in a form of habit of total rejection. We must know what we want - not just what we don't know.

There were many forms the computer could have taken. In 1800s, the computer was proposed by Babbage. And popularized by Ada Lovelace. It was seen as a tool that would have huge social uses and that should be in the hands of many people, but when the computer was first developed during WWII - for cracking German codes for the military and for guiding ballistic missiles - computers became a very large centralized machine.

By the 80s, communities of hackers started to emerge which started to be fascinated with these huge machines - which at the time you had to get the time slice, to get the appointment to get to get some time to use the machine - they started to get jobs near these computing devices, because they wanted to know how these machines could work. They started to build their own computers in their garages, in their houses and universities - and that was the birth of the personal computers, the reason why we now have laptops and telephones.

What happened was: a lot of big companies started to come along and they started to invest a lot of capital. All of the hacker community - who up until that point had never seen money before in their life - to throw themselves at, at the proprietary industry. And whereas before the culture that had created this personal computers, this liberatory technology, really believed in power to use the technology to improve the humanity for the better, who really believed in free technology, in sharing techniques and code with each other - instead became siloed off.

But there was one guy - Richard Stallman - he was just a guy - he found this ethically wrong. If enough people got together, we could give a challenge against the proprietary industry. He made that as a proposal to the community - that it doesn't have to be this way, if we together put our energies we can build our own operating system. A lot of people at that time thought that he was crazy or that his ideas weren't feasible.

This is early video of Richard Stallman.

<video - Richard Stallman>

((some parts missing))

...you are at that person's mercy. You you become downtrodden and resigned. That's what happens when the blueprints to the computer program are kept secret by the organization that sells it. That's the usual way how things are done.

</video>

So, in 1991, the cryptography was classified as ammunitions and Philip Zimmermann wrote the first freely available encryption software for anybody to use and he uploaded it to the Internet. The American government arrested him and he was facing a decade in prison. What Philip Zimmerman did was to print the source code of PGP - of this encryption software - which he sold internationally, which is something that in America is protected under the First Amendment. And the American government was realizing that they couldn't continue with the case, they dropped the case. And since that time, because of the action of Philip Zimmermann, software became classified as a form of speech. And cryptography became widely available. It's now reason why cryptography is available everywhere.

Also, in early 90s, Stallman has started to piece together his operating system. And by now a community a community of people has emerged around him. It was the birth of Linux - a really important piece of technology. Not just in the free technology world, but in general, in hi-tech space it place a very key role. And that was a rise of the whole bunch of movements: free software movement, hacker movement, crypto-anarchist movement. Movements were invigorated with creating a lot of new ideas and a lot of new concepts about how we could use the technology to shape the world around us. These were collective movements driven by the shared sense of purpose.

Towards the end of the 90s (the baby boomer generation), the western society became overly optimistic. Something the Jean Baudrillard called 'the dead of society' and 'obsession with desert-like forms / with the simulacrum'.

Stallman free software movement failed to capitalize on institutionalizing his movement. And what happen was what emerged was the open source movement. It was a movement that said: making this technology is not a question of freedom/ethics, it's simply when you have access to source code of a program it's more efficient, it's cheaper, it makes more quality code. I don't think that's true, but that was their argument. One of the main spokesmen was Eric Raymond who released a book called 'A cathedral and a bazaar'. In that book, Eric Raymond has described the open source development philosophy as open bazaar where everybody, dozens or hundreds of people, a wide number of people all collaborated in a horizontal manner. He coined an idea that given enough eyes all bugs are shallow. When we have a piece of source code, if there are enough people - all contributing a small amount of time and looking at the source code - then if there is a bug, that bug will be found. The idea that given a huge amount of people with a small amount of contribution of each, that we can develop projects and advance technology.

Then what happened was the biggest event in the modern western history - which was the collapse of the twin towers, the twin idols of capitalism, perfect in a reflections, reaching into the skyline of New York - which realized our deepest most hidden desires to see the destruction of this passive lifeless world. And what it represented was the return of the real (of the) dark forces - that we ignored - back to penetrate into our reality.

In early 2000s we saw a lot of optimism and momentum for change. We saw the Arab spring, we saw The occupy, we saw the orange revolutions. In the technology world, we saw a lot of advances, there was a huge amount of optimism for Linux on the desktop. Every year the people were saying: this is going be the year of the desktop. Everybody was waiting for that sudden single breakthrough. One of the major developments in technology world was the confrontation that took place between Hollywood and a Manhattan programmer called Bram Cohen. ((...)) He developed BitTorrent. The concept started with sites like Napster or Kazaa - that were centralized services that were shut down by authorities.

Cohen came up with a concept: if enough people downloading files and seeding them at the same time - then the more people that download the file the more that file will become widely distributed in the network. So, that file will become shared in a self-regulating network. It was a big success and the movie studios didn't know what to do about this, they were completely powerless in face of this technology. The idea of creating a functional self-regulating system outside of power proved itself and it's something wildly popular among technologists.

The next major development is the shutdown of the Pirate bay which led to the development of the Pirate party that at one point had double digits in elections and even entered into the EU parliament. There is huge momentum behind it. Wikipedia was also developed - the idea that given thousands and thousands of people all contributing small edits, one line at time, could build this huge knowledge resource . Around this movements started to emerge the new priests of this internet-centric decentralization technology - people like Yochai Benkler, academics who would go to conferences and sell this ideology to people.

But something strange started to emerge. Wikipedia released statistics about edits on Wikipedia. We found that it was a small group of dedicated people that wrote the majority of Wikipedia, people who really believed in the project and spent all their time writing the majority of the articles on the website. When we started to look closer at these decentralized systems, what we observed was small groups of leaders surrounded by a wider community. In BitTorent, it wasn't that everybody was seeding in the network. Most people, after they downloaded, didn't continue to run the software. In fact, it was a small group of users, who wanted to challenge Hollywood and promote BitTorrent, who would leave their software running seeding torrents.

In open source, we observed that there were small groups of dedicated developers in a project surrounded by wider community. And in fact, what Stallman has done was not just to write Linux and put that in the community, but he had written articles, he had written manifestos, he had put forward a vision and an ideology that pulled together enough people and drove this movement of hackers forwards.

So what drove these projects for freedom was not a new model or a new technique. It was a vision that pulled together enough people to realize an idea. To understand why Occupy and Arab Spring and orange revolutions and the Pirate Party and a lot of these movements had a huge of amount of will and movement - fail, it's really instructive to understand what happened to Egypt. In Egypt, huge amounts of youths started to mobilize through Facebook and they started to go to this center in Cairo to front the military dictatorship. Huge amount of people died in that struggle. And after they threw out ((?)) the military dictatorship, the youth then sat down and said: ""Okay, now what we are gonna do? What's next?"". So they started to discuss.

And into that, came a group of people, with a vision, with an ideology, that was well organized and able to pull together enough strands of the society behind them. But they could put their vision into power. And that was the Muslim Brotherhood.

And then the same youth hood - that kicked out the military dictatorship - came back to the square to ask the military dictatorship to come back and rescue them from the Islamists.

At the same time, Satoshi developed Bitcoin. I remember on Satoshi's early website he described it as a peer-to-peer form of money that cannot be controlled by central banks and governments. And it's something that attracted libertarians, cryptographers and hackers. Bitcoin is kind of a technology - free technology project - that was a little late to the party. Interestingly, it finds itself in the same place as the movements that preceded it. The fundamental problem with Bitcoin is not a problem of missing this or that technology, it's a problem of a lack of vision, a lack of how this technology is -

And it's not just about Bitcoin - it's something to do with the wider technology movement. We have to understand the global situation now. Humanity is facing a future with a huge amount of suffering. We are facing the threats from terrorism, from immigration. There's the rise of new ideological movements - ISIS just went and took a city in southern Philippines for more than a month - which is right next to Indonesia, the biggest Muslim country in the world. And in Europe the new right movement is getting very strong, organizing training camps, becoming well-organized, getting into political power and well-funded. This is the reality of our situation now.

We have to think about how this technologies that we make -, where do they situate themselves in the wider global context.

In Rojava, there is also a really important movement with the ideology of democratic confederalism which is the way forward from anarchism. And offers a really good analysis of what is the current society and what is the crisis that we're facing. And how, in that place, revolutionaries from all over the world are going to learning the methodology and ideology of this movement. It's a new emerging movement outside of any one person's control, but new forces can be harnessed. What we have to understand is that anarchist movement and the hacker movement is something deeply connected. The problem with anarchism is that it failed in it's potential to advance humanity forward, it's simply an ideology that no longer is able to work. What we have in Rojava is a libertarian revolution of 5 million people. What is democratic confederalism? It's an ideological movement that opposes the state as a mechanical worldview and sees the nature as something that is divine, that seeks to restore the balance back between internal+subjective and external+material world. The freedom comes from reaching our destiny as human beings, not simply through pleasure seeking. (Liberalism is the destruction of the free society.) And the better humanity it's not simply a happier humanity but stronger freer humanity. The crisis in the West not simply an economic crisis, but social crisis - we're facing a deep cultural issue.

All of the ideas in hacker movement - such as BitLaw, digital governance, cryptographic economy, decentralized organization, new economic models, new technical tools - unless we are able to take all of these concepts and put them into a plan, with a sense of direction, that we can put these into practice - then it's something that's going to be lost. Now, what's presenting itself is a massive opportunity for hackers to put their ideas into practice.

So, right now we are building a hacker team. There's 3 tasks we have to do: study of all the ideas and concepts in technology. From this study we have to develop a long- term plan. And thirdly, we have to devote ourselves to build the technical base of this new emerging democratic confederalism movement, we have to create revolutionary hackers dedicated to the course. If we don't, then all of the technology we are making is outside of the society, it's a toy, and what is relevant in this world is not making new products to fill the spaces in the environment around us, but using technology to shape politics that influence the world around us.

This revolution in North Syria or Rojava is the biggest opportunity in the entire history of modernity. Through this we can give direction to the hacker movement. One of our main projects is a Bitcoin project. We have a nation of 5 million people and - and - and there is a financial situation where they're under financial embargo, they use - , they don't have the financial infrastructure so they use paper money and Syrian Lira is inflating massively. Because there's embargo so you can't send money in and out. Also there is a project to create decentralized economy and there's a lot of real concrete uses for Bitcoin. And also the ideology of the revolutionary nation is in line with the vision and values of the Bitcoin.

When we decide to look at deploying Bitcoin, what we realize is that Bitcoin is not ready and there's a lot of new things that need to be developed in Bitcoin, they should make it so it's able to be deployed on a scale of 5 million people. We are assembling a project to deploy Bitcoin as the national currency of Rojava. We want to create new products in practical use on a large scale. Products that solve real problems and serve the cause of freedom.

Towards this goal, we're assembling a team of 20 hackers dedicated for two years. We're looking to establish links with companies and sponsors to make this happen. The first step is to establish a hacker's academy in Greece - to train groups of revolutionary self-sufficient hackers that we're going to deploy on projects. Our needs now: partners, sponsors, space, support. 

Our first plan is to setup exchange shops and localized wallets in Bitcoin where people come buy vouchers and use Bitcoin to create a local Bitcoin market. We have to create brochures, lots of information. Once this system gets bigger, then we also need to think of bigger financial infrastructure - so one of the things is paper wallets. At the moment, 100 thousands paper wallet cost $6000. Unfortunately the counterfeiting measures on the paper wallets aren't very well made. There needs to be a lot research done. There is a small USB device called ESP 12 which can be programmed with micro Python and C and it has on-board Wi-Fi, plus you can fit modules for radio. Through that you can create a large scale payments networks with cheap consumer devices that cost fie dollars each for people to transact bitcoins.

There is also a big market for Bitcoin because sending money between Rojava and Istanbul currently costs 5 %. Later, we also can create plastic card system where we print cards and also establish payments network using radio systems. There needs to be a lot of development and investigations in Lightning Networks and other technologies.

This is why I [want to ((?))] have a laboratory - if I take a group of people there - I can create all kinds of technology projects and a lot of concepts we've been theorizing for a long time. We can see that it works practically.


There is also the project of the Pirates to create liquid democracy - there is a system of local councils in every neighborhood which  - , a lot of these digital platforms that have been developed for many years - we can deploy them. There was also the economy being based on cooperatives - all of the ideas about economic management, about collective management of resources about using cryptography and currencies to manage cooperatives. These all things we can deploy - but what it's going to take is a group of people who's doing this research, who's going deep - not only in terms of developing new concepts - but looking back into the literature about what were - , what is the history of the movement, where we situated it and also what are the concepts and how we can apply them towards our goal.

I'm gonna to finish my talk on that. Does anybody have questions?

ADA,Bitcoin,How to avoid paying high fees in UK?," 

So, I know that this subject has been addressed many times in the past but I feel that things have changed recently as I am based in UK and has been some changes since brexit happened and and.

I have been buying ADA and Bitcoin for a couple of years. Recently I changed my strategy to dollar-cost averaging rather than buying bigger chunks from time to time (that is the main reason why paying high percentage of fees does not look appealing), the thing is that until now have been enjoying buying on Swipe with GPB and then sending BTC to celsius and ADA to daedalus with no fees when buying and sending to a different wallet but that is going to change on 22/1/21 as they are going to discontinue FIAT and stable coins on the app, and since the 1/1/21 they are charging 3.9% on credit/debit deposits (Bank accounts transfers/SEPA are not available in UK).

Over this couple of years I have tried many different ways to buy crypto (Kraken, Binance, [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/)) but in all of them I ended up paying quite a lot deposit fees and and withdrawal fees.

I am aware that on celsius I can buy from the app but the fees are very high too, so I was wondering what method do you guys use in UK if you have found any way of buying crypto that you feel comfortable with or is it just me that I feel like I am loosing quite a lot on fees and I should change my perspective on that.

Hopefully answers on this post will help newcomers as well (At least those ones based in UK)

ADA,Bitcoin,Dollar Cost Averaging - Best Way to Establish a Position Over Time,"Hey everyone,

I've been buying Bitcoin everyday for a little over a year now and I've seen the results of steadily buying Bitcoin drastically eclipse the returns from my 401K and other traditional investments (my current asset allocation is \~53% stocks, 5% bonds + REITs, 27% Crypto + Stablecoins, 15% cash) so I wanted to share some of the results in case anyone else had been thinking about trying something like this. 

I've done monthly DCA with the top Altcoins (ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC, EOS, ADA, XTZ, XLM, LINK) since around May of 2020 - these results have been much more mixed (from +19% to -26%). I don't doubt that some would work if you stuck with them, but I've found the most success with Bitcoin.  

High level results: 

401k returns since 2016: +17% (investing in Vanguard mutual funds)

BTC returns from only DCA daily buys in 2019+2020 (as of today $14,000 price): +57%

Tracking these buys automatically and graphing the prices you buy at (if you buy at regular intervals) will give you a really good idea of when you should take advantage of a large buy. Example: When the price crashed in March I saw that the price had fallen below my cost basis (or breakeven price). That along with months of daily price data gave me the confidence to buy the dip (I am usually very skeptical of market timing, and you should be too). But identifying that opportunity and taking action was obviously very lucrative (as of today).  

I think this being a halving year / post halving year (and the macro backdrop USA printing trillions in stimulus) have helped push the gains higher than they would have been otherwise, but I still think this is the most conservative way to get into Bitcoin and will continue the strategy for the foreseeable future.

ADA,Bitcoin,Not your parents market.... anymore!,"I get it we all would like the comfort of knowing.... within some degree.... what is going to happen next. The warmth we gain from some predictable next day, the good ""feels"" we get thinking we can bet on something being manageable and therefore under some fictional sense of control. Well the crypto currency market is no longer that. This isn't the same market as 2017 or for that matter not even the same as last year. Let me explain....  


In previous years we saw the repeat behavior of crypto currencies being flat through most of the year. This was followed by a sharp spike from Nov 1st through Jan 1st pretty damn regular. Over the years this did equal good growth for Bitcoin and the alt coins but still resulted in a massive selloff come January and mostly dead market for the bulk of the year.... ***nope, not anymore!!!*** This year it is not following this pattern as you all can plainly see. The market is still up?!?! WHAT?!?! How can this be????  Can it continue? Will it continue? What is happening? Where is my lame duck, same old same, repeatable behavior???  Well it is gone deal with it... and embrace it, The future is good!!  


Instead what we have to come to grips with is this ""New Crypto Market"" (NCM) where we see the continued  rise and fall and steady gain of all coins. We see days where one person who should remain silent.... not mentioning names here, Janet..... can sway a market with nothing more than an opinion minus facts. We see a market that can swing by the power you an I bring to bear - **yes WE CAN MOVE THIS MARKET TOO.... JANET!** We read on the daily how ""XYZ"" firm is buying into the crypto-gold-rush movement. All financial pundits are saying ""You should be in crypto for some portion of your portfolio"". We also see that the lies about how it is used for illicit reasons **IS NO DIFFERENT** then what happens daily with every fiat currency. Last I knew pallets of real USA dollars were used to buy and sell many many tons of drugs, buy/sell real humans, given to countries as payoffs... and every other nefarious thing imaginable.   
***FIAT CURRENCY IS WAY WORSE THAN CRYPTO when it comes to usage for ""illicit dealings""..... Janet.***   


The main reason I urge people to get into the NCM now is that we have seen the world turn a corner unlike years previously. Now we see that the traditional financial world has embraced and agreed that our ""Illicit and difficult currency"" ....PSSSH only for them..... has in fact become a reality in which they need to come to. It is no longer us making a case about why it should be used. No longer us explaining why it is better. Now it is upon those ""old school"" hold outs to see the light.  


**FIAT CURRENCY IS DEAD..... if not now it will be shortly.** When you can manipulate a currency to control the populace by simply adding zeros to the total at will... and at the whim of the government, you put another knife in it by the day. Well we are all aware of this and know that your fiat currency will die on the vine soon. We need only look to the myriad of failed currencies in the modern world now.... Greece... Venezuela... etc. Not to mention I can go to any other place in the world and not even deal with an exchange rate plus fees that your fiat currencies impose. I simply pay in bitcoin anywhere - a true world currency!!  


As anyone knows and the plethora of commercials show us... ""**When the Dollar goes down.... RUN TO GOLD!**"" and yes we have seen a huge uptick in gold/silver/precious metals buy in. Ok I get it.... **Dollar BAD .... Gold Good.** However.... I contend that if the governments and the financial mega-players control that commodity too.... and we can still dig plenty out of the ground.... will it not too fail? I mean wont they also manipulate that market as well as just go grab more that we ourselves cannot?  


So AGAIN I will say it for the cheap seats... The NEW CRYPTO MARKET is not your parents market, because in the finite world of crypto coins.... in the world of ""mass control"" and not government control.... in the world of Fiat currency death.... and yes even in the world of precious metal control.... the NCM is what will prevail!!! If you are not in now at what will be seen as the ""Ground Floor"" you are making a huge mistake!

ADA,Bitcoin,Supply of Bitcoin,"I have what might be a stupid question.  Maybe the kind of thing that I understand about one minute after posting, but here goes anyway.

The minimum unit of the measure for a dollar is one cent.  In theory we can go lower than one cent, but nothing is priced that way.  Its not convention.  The smallest unit of measure is 1c.

If I have computer mouse and a keyboard both priced at lets say one then thousandth of a Bitcoin then they seem to be priced in a way that describes their value to me.  Lets say Bitcoin goes up, now they are each one hundred thousandth of a Bitcoin.  Price goes up again, now they are one millionth of a Bitcoin, then a billionth, then a trillionth and so on...

Is there a smallest unit of measure for transaction in Bitcoin?  And if there isn't then although the total supply of Bitcoins is more or less fixed does that it mean that as a currency the supply is in fact limitless?

I am a fan but I'm still trying to get my head around the value proposition.  I can see that there is a value in the best network design ergo demand for the currency to use it, so I have Ether, Dot and ADA.  But I have been uncomfortable investing in other things that I don't understand.

Is the supply of Bitcoin as a currency limitless?  Any help would be appreciated.",2,2021-02-28 14:47:01,6
ADA,Bitcoin,"I wrote an algorithm to buy cryptocurrency based on what coins Reddit talks about positively and I've been running it for 3 weeks, here are the results","Reddit feels positively about Bitcoin? Let’s buy some. Reddit likes ALGO today – great let’s get some of that as well. 

I built an algorithm to do just that, you can see a detailed guide on how to set up your own reddit sentiment crypto trading bot [here](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/07/10/coding-a-crypto-trading-algorithm-that-analyses-reddit-sentiment/) and I have been testing it for about three weeks now.

Today it’s time to look at the overall performance, as well as how the bot logic has worked in general.

During this testing period the bot has accumulated 20 out of the top 40 coins by Marketcap: BTC, ETH, ALGO, XLM, ADA, SOL, LINK, DOGE, MATIC, XTZ, LTC, VET, DAI, CAKE, DOT, EOS, AAVE, XMR, MKR, ATOM.

The parameters I gave my crypto trading bot is to only look for keywords from the top 40 coins by marketcap, in order to stop it from buying into scams or other suspicious projects. Within 3 weeks the bot has invested in half of the top 40 coins.

Looking at some of the coins that weren’t picked up by our bot tends to reveal an interesting conclusion: USDT, BUSD, BNB, USDC, UNI, Crypto.com, SHIBA. Although these are in top 40, Reddit didn’t bother talking about them, or not positively at any rate.

What these coins have in common is that most of them are transactional tokens, stablecoins, or downright useless coins (looking at you SHIBA). As a Redditor myself, I’m quite proud of the result generated by the hivemind, yes DOGE is there but it doesn’t matter. Most coins picked by the trading bot with help of the Reddit sentiment are coins that I would invest into myself. 

For now the return on our investment doesn’t look so great. But then again, no accumulation strategy will perform well in a downtrend so this is not representative of the overall result. The outcome is relatively predictable, if the market is up, we’re up as we’re buying the actual asset and not using CFDs or futures trading.

The scatter plot below helps to clear out a bit of the spaghetti that’s going on in the previous chart, for a better look at the daily performance.

*Processing img pigu3h07sic71...*

Overall I’m on 15% loss, but as the entire market is down, this is not indicative of the performance. The data that does get me excited is the quality of the coins bought, which means that if nothing else, this could be an automated buy and hold diversification strategy.

See how you can set this up yourself to use in test mode or live mode (at your own risk).

ADA,Bitcoin,How I managed to make a ton of money in crypto and lose almost all of it in 2 short months,"I was up 280% (!!!) on my whole portfolio and then this happened…

It all started in September when I decided to enter the crypto market, I was so passionate about it.. I spent hours reading about Blockchain and cryptocurrencies and how it’s going to change the world, reading about all the influential people and big stock market money flowing in to the market.. 
I’ve been following the cryptocurrency market since July market cap was at 80-100 Billion, I watched carefully as I saw the market cap grow to 140 Billion in September and decided to jump in. I convinced my brother to put in 10k and I put in 20k and off we went.

The dream comes true...
Have you ever felt you are at the right time at the right place?!?! Because this feeling never happened to me before… 
Wow October we were up 50% November an extra 70% by Mid-December I was up 300% on my whole portfolio!!!! Hollyshit… I remember being in a coin called ADA while it flew 400% in 2 days!!!
Honestly I was already dreaming about buying an apartment, putting aside money for my future kids and helping out my parents with their mortgage payments.

The higher you go up the harder you fall..
By the end of December my portfolio was up by 350%..
At this point I was talking to my self mainly “can this be?” should I take out some of the funds I put in? shold I take out my initial investment?
Sure it’s easy to look back and make decisions… but at the time 1 trillion dollar market cap didn’t look like a problem.. I spoke to my Brother and even though we talked about liquidating some of our investments we never did…
January came by and all the hope and dreams came down crashing.. it started with a small downtrend and became one of the worst bear markets the crypto market has even seen… people are running around screaming in the streets.. blood all over.. JK that was in my head but I sure did see a change in sentiment, suddenly positive news became negative and everywhere I could just see noobies like my self panicking.



Conclusions and why I am optimistic about the future 
Yes it sucks, yes I was up 350% and now I am down almost 50% on my entire portfolio, but honestly what was I thinking? This isn’t a get rich scheme.. this is the future of technology and exchange of value as we know it… the biggest companies and countries in the world are just at the beginning of adopting Blockchain and using cryptocurrencies. 
1 thing is for sure, I’ve learned my lesson. When you’re up by a substantial amount of % on your portfolio you always ALWAYS take out at least your initial investment or a third of what you invest. This experience made me a better investor and better trader.

My recent findings
Since February when my portfolio was bleeding to death, I was looking for some sort of Mentor I can follow, someone real that gives real advice.. bot these fake twitter influencers or telegram signal accounts but someone I can ask questions and get real answers from a real trader or investor with experience.
So first off I like watching Tone vays, a real trader and expert analysis that keeps the bull shit out and gives you real technical analysis.
and then I stumbled upon this 60+ yo with 30 years of trading experience and a young 32 yo doctor who post a lot on Reddit, at first I was skeptical but as I followed I started to feel these people were honest people that want to help other new traders like my self… I contacted them and wow… amazing human beings.. Remi (the doctor) spent an hour and a half on giving me fundamental tools to look at and went over my portfolio to help me recover, while I am currently learning TA from Mack a true expert in TA.
This is not a promotion for them nor am I affiliated with them just thought I would share what I found and let other traders like me know, there are good people out there that want to help…",9,2018-04-12 11:34:19,19

Disgusting to see so many startups taking such unprofessional actions. Why do they?

Likewise with many other languages such as Ruby and other recent ""flavor of the moment"" programming languages.

Just because it is ""easy"" to build something in a given programming language does not validate actually doing so.

Mt. Gox was written in PHP. Lesson unfortunately not learned.

PHP is a cheap and easy language created for amateurs and unskilled hackers to cobble together websites. That it is being used to construct financial software for bitcoin or other financial purposes speaks more to the naivete and unprofessionalism of those who employ it for such uses. 

That a certain Florida based bitcoin exchange was written in PHP should make its customers very uncomfortable.

Customers unfortunately are in the difficult position of being unable to ascertain whether the service they are contemplating using is one that was built according to high quality standards, by experienced professionals or built to get to market cheaply and quickly without regard to customer security and safety. How can the average customer be expected to perform due diligence on a company at a technical level?

I think insiders like myself need to raise our voices a little louder in the bitcoin community to call out those who are behaving like amateurs and incompetent sharks. I still regret not raising an alarm call many, many months before Mt. Gox's inevitable collapse.

I thought I'd continue the learning process by transferring an amount from Crypto\\com to my Exodus wallet, but the Cyprpto app is saying there's a minimum amount, which I don't have, having only invested £80 as a playing around fund.

ADA,Bitcoin,!,"Saw a similar post and felt the need to say something myself. I've posted maybe once or twice in my life on this site and never in this this thread, but I've been a part of the crypto community since 2015. A believer when everyone would make fun of you and tell you it was a scam. 

At times we were all somewhat skeptical that it may get banned, but I always believed/held enough and rode the wave, learned from the masters. YouTube and reading. Learned Market Cap simplicity, what HODL means, shout out IvanOnTech. Studied for years on a daily basis. Working on my own project. Held: ADA, DOT, ETH BTC, MATIC, LINK. Had diverse portfolios in two main exchanges (so paranoid I don't even want to say which), and a few others. So, those were, one, my HODL and, two, my main trade volume for any new decisions. I had a full DCA plan I was following in and out, all set. 

My first dog's name was Sheba, that dog loved my dad. I learned about the token SHIB on April 26/27. I looked at the tokenomics, shout out IvanOnTech. Even though there was definitely some uncertainty, I saw the potential. It had the perfect storm (all the right momentum) trendy, new, meme, and just look at the growth!

My father has had terminal *gastric* *cancer* for a couple years, since spring 2019, and we all hate even the sound of that word, but he understood crypto. Even at 64, he supported it and saw the vision. His vision was respected by all, from engineers to architects. He was one of those special people who can just do everything. Well, I knew there was no time left. I wanted his only son to make him so proud by becoming a millionaire before he died. 

There is no get rich quick, but I thought  I had this. I'd been working at it for years. So wanting to show my dad that I could be a millionaire before he died, I made a lot of moves. 

He worked construction as a laborer most his life, became superintendent because of his ethic and leadership, and then died as soon as he retired working 12 hr. days, every day, for the family he loved. I'm the only kid other than our lil pup pup Bella, she's such a good lab! 

He has always been proud of me, but I saw this as a special moment, something had meaning. I thought, ""Hotbit is huge, they are the only one with SHIB (so I thought), go all in. Go more in. Price drops, buy more. Price drops, buy more."" Averaged in total at like $ 0.00000135 with like 2/3 of my total funds. Some logic, sure, but  I broke rule #1. I let emotion, the first rule of trading, influence me. I never let that happen, until I did.

My father died on April 28th, 2021. His funeral was today. My girlfriend of 6 months and I mutually split a couple weeks back. My financial hopes and dreams feel in shambles now... 

But, luckily, I've been lower. Somehow depression can take you really low if you let it, but you've just got to fight back. This was my fault. I can't control the death of my father, and life goes on. If hotbit comes back, I will see it as nothing short of a miracle because I could use one right about now. Trying to spread the love with this post because I know someone else probably did something similar and hopefully we can share a little pain together and then maybe a little love (no butt stuff).  

It does get better, it is already healing because I'm letting it get better. At first, I felt so toxic. Get that out of you now if you have it because it will only bring you down further. But yea, imagine dating a doctor you think you might marry, losing your father/best friend, and then being robbed of a majority of your wealth. Wow, I don't know how I'm not in pieces.

Buy what you like the idea of and push all other ideas that improve the idea or are just riding the wave.

We are just before a time where all crypto has been full taken under control by financial authorities, and i’m sure most that hold this view will feel the same but, if you sell anything of value now because of the media or charts or anything you use to gauge money. Then you won’t change money. 
Don’t sell because you’ve been sold into a dip. Don’t buy high after a rebound. 
Just use what we have right now for its best use.

•   Fiat Currency is backed by Governments/Countries itself. What determines the value of a currency is the economic health, demand, growth, political stability to name a few, of the respective country. Before 1930, most fiat currencies were backed by gold and silver.  


•   Since 1971, U.S. citizens have been able to utilize Federal Reserve Notes as the only form of money that for the first time had no currency with any gold or silver backing. This is where you get the saying that U.S. dollars are backed by the “full faith and credit” of the U.S. Government - quoted in google.com.  


•   What backs crypto value is purely supply and demand. The demand creation of a crypto is its sole objective. To create demand, the crypto has to have a purpose. And most purpose commonly promoted is utility. The number of ways you can utilize the said crypto. The more utilization factors the more demand there is for it.  


•   There are other ways to substantiate value of a crypto and that is to back the crypto with a 1 to 1 ratio in assets or in USD. Then the question is, how 3,000 crypto currencies in circulation be monetary eco sustainable? Can anyone imagine walking into McDonald and view a chart of 3,000 different pricing? Which also means the crypto is a payment gateway pegging against USD instead of bearing any true characteristic of a currency.  


•   A country’s currency is in its own legit form of legal tender, the only currency acceptable under financial sovereigns of a country. People in the world must be made to understand that. Retailers in Thailand cannot put up products price tags in EUROS/USD, it is illegal. It has to be in Thai Baht.  


•   It is hardly imaginable for everyone in the world to retail with a Crypto-Currencies at a rate of 7 transactions per second. When mining nodes are reduced due to non-performing mining ratio, mining blocks in the Blockchain will significantly be limited too, rendering delays in transactions while usage increases.  


•   In time to come, as trends of crypto picks up, Thailand can issue BAHT COIN or UK the STERLING COIN, exactly what China wishes to do. Digital RMB, but would such crypto currencies be fully decentralized? We all have our answers. Absurd to even think of producing Thai Baht, Pound Sterling or Chinese Yuan at the cost of electricity. It is currencies in digital forms.  


KRATSCOIN is not meant for that purpose. In some opinion, apart from utilization, a crypto can be for safekeeping, an entity for keeping money while allowing easy liquidation, at a click of a mobile button, not to mention sending or transferring without the trouble of going to banks, which was the original purpose of Bitcoin to begin with. Therefore, KRATSCOIN would be better termed as Crypto Commodity, sharing similarities as Metal Commodities.  


An individual cannot use gold to make a purchase, neither can one eat gold. It can only be kept or invest in for appreciative value over time. Gold is being exampled for its scarcity which reasons for its higher value over its cousin, silver or bronze. Who or what determines the value of gold? Just like any other crypto, demand by humanity. As in all other commodities, it must also be placed in checks by governments. To put in checks, serial numbers are introduced to protect a country’s commodities outflows or illegal exports.  


Humanity made Bitcoin a reality. Acceptance by the majority members of the public made Bitcoin to what is it today with the trust they entrusted it with, or is the majority public hopping on the band wagon to make a few quick extra bucks? Whatever the reasons are, the characteristics of Crypto Currencies are only matched by the behavior of Commodities.  


SERIALIZED COINS - WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE PUBLIC:  
Every currency has its own remarkable name, design and colors. Dollars, Euros, Pound, Tugrik, Peso, Rupee, Rupiah, Dina, Ringgit, Baht and the list carries on. One thing every currency have in common - Serial Numbers.  


In any crime, investigators will firstly establish motives and mode of operation, both of which are very likely related to money. So following the money trial is a natural thing to do for investigators/authorities and it has become a common practice. Crimes require funding ie robbers need money to buy guns to carry out its robbing activities. Cutting off financing will reduce criminal activities. That’s the approach governments of the WORLD have adopted for crime fighting.  


Perhaps people do not realize this while most do not feel the pinch. Humanity tends to take life for granted until apocalypse happens. Take a minute to visualize the tallest tower in your homeland collapse into a pile of dust with thousands of casualties effecting everything else that comes to mind. Imagine a family member, just 1 is enough, is among those casualties.  


• Imagine if monetary system is not in place and drug dealers, among many, roam the earth freely distributing what can be death threatening substance to your kids. What if you are mugged of your inheritance \[items left to you by your father\] that is beyond retrieval? As for crypto enthusiast, what if your wallet gets hacked as even the mighty Pentagon gets hacked. All the above can go away if the crypto system leaves a trail for hound dogs to sniff out. Money Trail or Serial Codes Trail to be exact.  


• Citizens rely on governments and their countries to do what is best for them to lead their daily lives, flourish, advance, improve and strive but at the same time, citizens want to take away the single most important thing deemed crucial in the hierarchy of humanity from governments with additional boastful remarks such as “I transferred $400 million from one corner of the earth to another corner in a single transaction and no governments can do anything about it”.  


• In-short, to boast unregulated financial movement is to arrogantly promote crime without realizing it while challenging the world’s monetary authority. Oldest advice in the book teaches us never to pick a fight we can’t win.  


• Serial Coded Coins does not take away the financial movement freedom nor does it take away your privacy. It merely provides Authorities the necessary means needed for crime prevention and fighting. It only re-inforce security and safety.  
SERIALIZED COINS - WHAT IT MEANS FOR GOVERNMENTS:  
• Governments are relentlessly trying to find new ways to keep track of crypto transactions. Crypto Currency Exchanges, just like all other Financial Institutions and Banks, are required to practice the most stringent Know Your Customer (widely known as KYC) process. The KYC is designed to provide governing agencies and authorities with information pertaining to crypto ownerships.  


• But no governments can have information on Peer-to-Peer (also known as P2P) transactions unless the government in question launch a full scale Federal Investigation on certain suspected individuals seeking Wallet Developers to unveil the ownership of certain wallet addresses. Do not forget, National and Global Security trumps Privacy Act. Refusal to co-operate under the pretext of Global or National Security will only result in an out-right ban, which is exactly what happened to Blackberry.  


• Questions to Governments – What if Wallet Developers or Crypto Exchanges shuts down which can happen for various reasons be it foul-play, sinister or forcefully under threat? What if servers are damaged and ruined? An EMP strike or a simple magnet can make it happen. Information/identities of suspected customers of such addresses shall be lost forever and along with it the Money Trial.  


• The most probable way of evading Authorities with crypto assets are developing an e-wallet for own illicit purpose. Since the cost of developing an e-wallet is relatively low in considerable cost to hiding, what can governments do to flush out these ants from the vast networks of tunnels?  


• With Serialized Coded Crypto Assets, it doesn’t matter if servers of Exchanges or Wallets are destroyed. The Serial Codes of each token/coin enables governments of every participating country to track both origin and destination by identifying records of each token/coin in wallet address. It can disappear into a cold wallet but emerging some place later yet Authorities can still detail which particular token/coin has at one moment of time been into which wallet, on what day and date.  


• If the battle of financial crimes can be resolved with a simple Serialize Coded Crypto Asset, the eradication of corruptions, money laundering, unlawful proceeds and terrorism financing will be made possible. Criminals can no longer exploit the genius creation of Sathoshi – Blockchain and Crypto-Currencies.  


• Global Security, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Money Laundering could just be excuses granting government agencies the need to have access to financial information in the Monetary System. Nonetheless, it is in the interest of every nation that capital outflow is controlled. Capital Outflow is most frequent when the economy of a country is deteriorating. In the face of an economy meltdown, monetary flow is most needed and yet citizens tend to transfer monies further away illegally from their own country in an act of selfishness. This would not be tolerated by any country. Serial Coded Coin shall prove this attempt futile.  


• In most part of Asian Countries, many crypto-currency mining operations are carried out illegally. The legality sits on thin fine line where Authorities can pin only stealing of electricity as a major concern to the respective country. Since most Power Companies belongs to the Country in one way or another, it is financially damaging to Power Producers and Utility Suppliers. Serial Codes can determine if the KRATSCOIN is mined legally or illegally making it difficult for miners or mining farms to mine crypto while avoiding making electricity payments. Will this deterrent disrupt the chain of KRATSCOIN supply? That’s not how Blockchain Tech works.  
TAXATIONS - WHAT IT MEANS FOR PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENTS:  
• Taxation cannot be imposed on “Illegal & Unlawful Proceeds” instead confiscation is enforced in many countries. Origins or proceeds of Serialized Coded Crypto Assets can be easily identified by the Serial Codes in-conjunction with the Blockchain. This exercise can evidently proof the legitimacy of the aforesaid token/coin. By “Illegal & Unlawful Proceeds” also refers to crypto coins obtained via illegal mining operations.  


• Taxation on Crypto Assets are calculated on profits deriving from the sale/disposal of the crypto Assets. If we are small crypto believers, the amount of taxation rendered by Inland Revenue will be insignificant. Why risk Freedom of Life over Freedom of Small Monies. If we are big crypto believers, taxation on Serialized Coded Coins can be considered added security to your assets protection.  


• By adopting Serialized Crypto Assets, declaration is made easily possible via proof of token/coin origin via the Blockchain. If the Authorities can know where our crypto assets come from, the Authorities will know where it will disappear to. It is taxation cum insurance in one tiny sum. This added security with freedom feature will encourage self-declarations of crypto assets to Authorities and Agencies.  
PRIVACY & ANONIMITY:  
• Many may be skeptical of their wealth being tracked and monitored. But in this era of technological advance society, everything we touches has our signature. Banks, iPhones, Samsung Mobiles, Google, Facebook, Whatsapp, WeChat, LINE, Viber, Facebook, Properties, Utilities. Almost everything. It is to this fact that there is a need for Privacy Protection Act.  


• As explained before, Crypto Currency Exchange KYC procedures is designed to expose the identity of Crypto Assets ownership. The Blockchain is supposed to serve as a transparent information platform. The question of privacy over Serialized Coded Coins does not exist, it does not make Serialized Coded Coins ownership any less private.  


• Ownership of wallet addresses shall always remain anonymous while the only way Authorities can get to it is through Wallet Developers by virtue of Global/National Security Threats or by a Court Order as per the Privacy Protection Act.  
SAFETY & SECURITY (CODED CRYPTO VS FIAT + COMMODITIES):  
• No human mind can memorize the millions of serial numbers printed on fiat currencies. The records of Serialized Coded Coins will forever be in the Blockchain embedded within each transaction from wallet to wallet.  


• Serialized Commodities such as gold can be melted down. Diamonds recrafted. Fiat double printed. But not Serialized Coded Crypto Assets.  


• Should an accessory system be added into the KRATSCOIN Blockchain, allowing reports on criminal activity be made within the Blockchain, notifying all ledgers of certain stolen Serial Coded Coins, enabling WARNINGS and forbidding next transaction of that particular Serial Coded Coin, wouldn’t this function enhance protection. A theft deterrent function which can never be achieved with physical gold, diamonds or fiat.  
KRATSCOIN SUMMARY:  
• Most crypto currencies have not reach a level of security alert for governments. This could be the only reason why a possible ban has not been discussed. China and India has begun efforts to control or ban crypto currencies in their quest to combat capital outflow, writer’s personal opinion. The EU has stopped Libra from implementation. “A company cannot be allowed Authoring Power for issuance of currencies” quoted the governments. KRATSCOIN is fully decentralized with no ownership nor control by any country, company or individual. Once again, the beauty of Bitcoin decentralization concept prevails.  


• “There is no such thing as a world currency. However, since World War II, the dominant or reserve currency of the world has been the U.S. dollar” quoted in google.com.  


• Most countries have “Foreign Reserves” as backing to a country’s fiat currency. It is a mean of “back up” attempt should all factors above mentioned leading to the value of their currencies collapse. Then what will happen if the Country of the Foreign Reserves collapse?  


• Serial Coded KRATSCOIN belongs to no one, no country, no company and therefore theoretically shall not be effected by politics, war or global economy meltdown yet everyone, every country and every government is able to benefit from KRATSCOIN.

ADA,Bitcoin,'Room for Upside:' Kraken Reviews December's Crypto Market Rise,"Kraken Intelligence, our team of in-house research experts, has released its December 2020 Market Recap & Outlook Report, designed to summarize the month’s market developments and highlight key changes shaping our industry. 

Our newest report looks at what’s driving the most recent parabolic run and examines where BTC stands relative to both its prior market cycles and to more traditional assets. The report goes on to highlight the surge in Bitcoin’s adoption from corporations and celebrities, including NFL star Russell Okung, who became the first athlete to receive a salary in bitcoin. 

Additionally, we cover the monthly performance of assets including ETH, LTC, DOT and ADA.

Looking beyond crypto, we explore how the traditional markets have continued to rise in spite of a new COVID-19 strain, how the ECB expanded its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program and which major industrial countries left their rates unchanged. 

By downloading our report, you’ll gain new insights and receive our latest data on the fundamentals that are driving growth in the industry. 

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Big Buying** – Institutional adoption continued as companies such as MassMutual, SkyBridge Capital and One River Asset Management made multimillion-dollar Bitcoin allocations, while the CME announced it would offer ETH futures and Dow Jones said it will provide cryptocurrency indices in 2021.
* **Born to Run** – The most recent parabolic run has left plenty of room for speculation among believers and skeptics. The technicals provide a much simpler picture – there is room for upside. We project prices could continue even higher, as history shows major crypto market tops often reach specific multiples of major indicators.
* **Behind The Rally** – Bitcoin buyers continued to take purchases offline, storing crypto assets in cold wallets. Further, buy-side demand continued to outpace all liquidity activity and wallets holding over 100 BTC accumulated an additional 47,500 bitcoin.

ADA,Bitcoin,"Pelayanan Buruk, Call Center Akulaku Tertawa Dengar Korban Bayar Tagihan Penipu","Seorang pengguna Akulaku, Ferro, mengaku akunnya dibobol oleh oknum tidak bertanggung jawab dari Akulaku. 

Ferro mengatakan, data pribadinya yang sudah terdata di sistem Akulaku bocor. 

Alasannya ada transaksi mencurigakan tertanggal 27 Desember 2020 dalam akun Akulaku miliknya, namun tagihan tetap dibebankan kepada Ferro yang sebelumnya merupakan pengguna Akulaku yang memiliki riwayat pmbayaran yang sangat baik (belum pernah telat). 

Peristiwa naas ini bermula pada hari Minggu (27/12/2020) siang, saat Ferro tak bisa masuk (login) ke akun Akulaku. Karena terus-menerus gagal masuk, dia melayangkan komplain ke CS Akulaku.

Sebelumnya, pelanggan taat hukum ini dihubungi oleh oknum yang mengaku CS Akulaku (Layanan Customer Akulaku) di nomer:  +62 878-0100-1562 untuk menawarkan kenaikan limit. 

""Iya ada 7 kali transaksi mencurigakan yaitu pembelian pulsa 100 ribu dan pembelian voucher Shopee dua kali Rp500 ribu lebih. Padahal saldo maksimal di Akulaku saya itu hanya Rp600 ribu. Ini penipu bisa transaksi sampai Rp2 juta dan ngambil saldo saya Rp1 juta,"" ujar Ferro, di Jakarta, baru-baru ini. 

""Awalnya itu penipu minta kode OTP. Nomer, profil, buka kantor dll itu mirip banget sama Akulaku resmi. Sampai kenal nama-nama karyawan/ pegawai Akulaku dan atasan Akulaku. Gimana saya nggak curiga coba. Sekali saya kasih, nah pas kedua kali saya curiga nggak saya kasih, limit saya kok nggak naik. Disitu baru sadar saya kena ditipu oknum penjahat Akulaku. 3-4 jam langsung jebol Akun Akulaku milik saya,"" kesal Ferro panjang lebar sambil berlinang air mata. 

Ferro pun akhirnya menyayangkan dan mempertanyakan bagaimana sistem keamanan Akulaku. Tak hanya dirinya yang jadi korban, namun banyak masyarakat juga jadi korban yang jumlahnya ribuan. Pasalnya kebocoran data pribadi bukanlah hal yang bisa dimaklumi, karena ini sudah kasus pidana. 

Selain itu, menurut Ferro, pelayanan Akulaku juga sangat buruk. Bahkan, saat konsumen menghubungi Call Center atau CS Akulaku pada Kamis (7/1/2021), staff Call Center resmi Akulaku tertawa terbahak-bahak bahagia melihat penderitaan korban pembobolan atau kejahatan yang lagi terkena musibah. 

""Kita minta detail transaksi mencurigakan itu khusus hari Minggu, malah nggak dikasih. Kita ini korban lagi sedih disuruh bayar tagihan si penipu (orang lain) yang bukan kita transaksi. Eh malah staff Akulaku malah tertawa di telpon kayaknya bangga saya dibebankan tagihan orang lain. Ini kelakuan Akulaku sudah di luar akal manusia. Nyari untung dengan jerumusin orang lain,"" keluh Ferro meneteskan air mata. 

""Nelpon Akulaku aja sudah 500 ribu baru tersambung. Kayaknya Akulaku ini cari untung di tengah penderitaan orang lain. Sebelumnya riwayat saya sangat baik. Belum pernah telat bayar tagihan. Ini ada kasus ini jadi saya sudah muak dengan kebiadaban serta kezoliman Akulaku. Saya minta akun Akulaku saya dihapus dan distop selamanya (permanen) takut kejadian kayak gini lagi. Parahnya lagi staff Akulaku malah nantangin polisi,"" kesal Ferro dengan raut wajah sangat sedih. 


Tak hanya kepada Akulaku, Ferro juga sudah melaporkan hal ini kepada Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) dan Yayasan Lembaga Konsumen Indonesia (YLKI). Dan kasus kejahatan oknum Akulaku ini sudah tercatat dalam tanda bukti lapor kepolisian di Polda Metro Jaya, No: TBL/ 7659/ XII/ YAN 2.5/ 2020/ SPKT PMJ/ Tanggal 29 Desember 2020. 

Namun sayang, hingga berita atau artikel ini diturunkan belum ada respon apapun dari OJK dan YLKI.",0,2021-01-12 15:12:48,0
ADA,Bitcoin,Coinbase ID verification is very hard for blind users. Good alternatives that work in the EU?,"I used to be involved with Bitcoin back in the day, and had accounts with MTGox, Bitcoin24, and Bitcoinica (you see a pattern here ;-)). Today I wanted to get involved again, and I looked at exchanges that work in the EU. Coinbase seemed like the straightforward answer.

Unfortunately I'm blind and they inexplicably (to me) require taking a photo of my ID with my phone camera. This is basically never going to happen. There are blind people who can manage this, but I'm not one of them. I tried several times and got illegible results.

1. Why do they insist in this way of verifying ID? I sometimes need to send a photo of my ID and I have it scanned for a reason.
2. Are there other reliable ways to trade Bitcoin in the EU which do not involve this nonsense?

ADA,Bitcoin,I Love Bitcoin. That's Why I Sue Exchanges.,"Lots of folks believe that BTC and crypto ""can't be regulated."" Don't be naive, regulation is coming, and the speed with which it comes will accelerate dramatically if and when one of the exchanges collapses. 

Here's a short excerpt from the article, which--for noobs in particular--highlights again the critical importance of keeping your assets somewhere other than on an exchange, except for when you're moving in and out of positions. 

It's impossible to know when one the exchanges will fail, but if one does you should assume that 100% of your crypto stored on the exchange will be gone forever.

BTW, I'd be curious to know how many exchanges you can identify that meets this guy's criteria for those exchanges that will survive:

""That day of reckoning will collapse the weaker exchanges. Which exchanges will survive? Typically, those with the best leadership and that operate with transparency will rise to the top. As for those that fail?

Good luck collecting on your losses if you had entrusted your crypto to one of those exchanges. It's expensive, time consuming and you never know how it will turn out.

The answer there is: None of them have yet proven themselves to be winners; and any of them that look like winners might not in the near future once Uncle Sam and his relatives around the world wrap their hands around ICOs and crypto-related investments.""

1200s-1300s During the 13th century bankers from north Italy, collectively known as Lombards, gradually replace the Jews in their traditional role as money-lenders to the rich and powerful. – Florence, Venice and Genoa - The Bardi and Peruzzi Families dominated banking in 14th century Florence, establishing branches in many other parts of Europe

1200  By the time Marco Polo visited China they’d move from coins to paper money, who introduced the concept to Europe. An inscription warned, ""All counterfeiters will be decapitated."" Before the use of paper, the Chinese used coins that were circular, with a rectangular hole in the middle. Several coins could be strung together on a rope. Merchants in China, if they became rich enough, found that their strings of coins were too heavy to carry around easily. To solve this problem, coins were often left with a trustworthy person, and the merchant was given a slip of paper recording how much money they had with that person. Marco Polo's account of paper money during the Yuan Dynasty is the subject of a chapter of his book, The Travels of Marco Polo, titled ""How the Great Kaan Causeth the Bark of Trees, Made Into Something Like Paper, to Pass for Money All Over his Country.""

1577 Newspaper in Korea

1586 The Babington Plot

1590 Cabinet Noir was established in France. Its mission was to open, read and reseal letters, and great expertise was developed in the restoration of broken seals. In the knowledge that mail was being opened, correspondents began to develop systems to encrypt and decrypt their letters. The breaking of these codes gave birth to modern systematic scientific code breaking.

1600s Promissory banknotes began in London

1600s By the early 17th century banking begins also to exist in its modern sense - as a commercial service for customers rather than kings. – Late 17th century we see cheques slowly gains acceptance

The total of the money left on deposit by a bank's customers is a large sum, only a fraction of which is usually required for withdrawals. A proportion of the rest can be lent out at interest, bringing profit to the bank. When the customers later come to realize this hidden value of their unused funds, the bank's profit becomes the difference between the rates of interest paid to depositors and demanded from debtors.

The transformation from moneylenders into private banks is a gradual one during the 17th and 18th centuries. In England it is achieved by various families of goldsmiths who early in the period accept money on deposit purely for safe-keeping. Then they begin to lend some of it out. Finally, by the 18th century, they make banking their business in place of their original craft as goldsmiths.

1694 First Central Bank established in the UK was the first bank to initiate the permanent issue of banknotes

Served as model for most modern central banks.

The modern banknote rests on the assumption that money is determined by a social and legal consensus. A gold coin's value is simply a reflection of the supply and demand mechanism of a society exchanging goods in a free market, as opposed to stemming from any intrinsic property of the metal. By the late 17th century, this new conceptual outlook helped to stimulate the issue of banknotes.

1700s Throughout the commercially energetic 18th century there are frequent further experiments with bank notes - deriving from a recognized need to expand the currency supply beyond the availability of precious metals.

1907  Banking Panic of 1907

The New York Stock Exchange dropped dramatically as everyone tried to get their money out of the banks at the same time across the nation. This banking panic spurred debate for banking reform. JP Morgan and others gathered to create an image of concern and stability in the face of the panic, which eventually led to the formation of the Federal Reserve. The founders of the Federal Reserve pretended like the bankers were opposed to the idea of its formation in order to mislead the public into believing that the Federal Reserve would help to regulate bankers when in fact it really gave even more power to private bankers, but in a less transparent way.

ADA,Bitcoin,Transactions won't go through sending from my Bread wallet,"Hello, I honestly don't know too much about bitcoin so I might be asking a stupid question.  I was using an IOS bread wallet to send some btc on three occasions recently (12/11, 12/16 and 12/18) and none of the transactions have been confirmed yet. During that time I purchased bitcoin and those transactions have been fully confirmed. I've been using bitcoin for long enough to find that strange, that none of my payments are getting confirmed. I used a scanner and QR code to get the addresses so I know I didn't enter any of the addresses incorrectly. 

Is bread having issues of some kind? Or is there another easy explanation as to why my transactions aren't going through? I've found them on blockchain and everything.

Thanks so much",2,2017-12-19 06:35:08,3

ADA,Bitcoin,BitMEX: Good Or Bad for the Bitcoin Market?,"Its pretty evident that the cat is out of the bag and a lot of crypto traders noticed what happened when BitMEX went offline for a brief period during a scheduled maintenance last night. The exchange that has traded over 1 Million Bitcoin (BTC) in a day on two occasions, has been the fan favorite for traders who are taking advantage of the bear market and want to short the digital assets of Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA), EOS, Ethereum (ETH), Tron (TRX) and XRP.

&#x200B;

***​Its also public knowledge amongst traders that # Trading over there is as fast as greased lightning.***

&#x200B;

The million dollar question?? The value of BTC is if BitMEX is a friend or enemy to the general ecosystem of Bitcoin in the crypto markets. One argument that has been postulated is that during that one hour of maintenance on BitMEX, a majority of the short positions in the global crypto markets were inactive. This then means the Bulls had a chance to go long on BTC thus triggering a buying spree and a price increment.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, one may say that shorting Bitcoin and other digital assets is simply destroying the ecosystem and even preventing the SEC from approving ETFs based on the fact that the markets are too volatile. The reason why SEC declined 8 ETF proposals is it aims to at all times prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices, in short mandates to protect investors from shady trading,

&#x200B;

​The other side may argue that Bitmex is the oldest derivatives trading platform and has offered great trading/ investment options and in return also grown exponentially, so instance Bitmex enting the most expensive offices in Hong Kong.

ADA,Bitcoin,What crypto did for a young Latin American enthusiast.,"So, I wanted to share my experience in the crypto world and what it did for me, this ended up being longer than expected, so, sorry for the long post, also sorry if there’s grammar failures. 

There’s a TLDR at the end just in case.

----------------------------

At my 25’s was when I decided to jump on this train, although I had heard about bitcoin a while ago when it was “brand new” I did let the bad things that were said about it cloud my judgment, something that still happens nowadays. I wasn't smart enough to research about it and have my own vision of the future, even though that I consider myself a tech enthusiast, I didn't. 



I took my first steps when the mining\ETH boom, overpriced GPUs and out of stocks everywhere… With all this hubbub, I decided get know what was all this about. I started to research, reading, watching videos, learning, watching charts, and non sleeping doing all that… One of the things that I discovered was that I could get crypto by mining with my Rx-480, this was not only a gaming piece of tech, it turned out to be an investment, I got it for $190 a few months before the mining boom. I didn’t saw this mining thing as a long run thing, it was just to make enough for upgrading my old AMD FX PC to something better, ended with a Ryzen-Polaris build a few months later.
Mining with only one GPU, it took time, I did $400 a few months later, back at that time Bitcoin was $2500~$3000 dollars, only If I knew, today that would be thousands of dollars lol


In my country $400 US were $18,000 DOP, that’s half my monthly salary (Not much, but enough, for now) after reaching my goal for a new PC, I stopped mining, I wanted to preserve my GPU and enjoy it for a few years more. (which didn’t happen for long, sadly, it died at the beginning of December, I had to put back on duty my old HD5570 ([Picture inside](https://imgur.com/a/dUWdo) ) that I had lying around, I hope to return it to retirement soon, since a really nice guy from reddit offered me his old 650Ti after trying to help me with the RMA process, which is really difficult and expensive from here, almost like buying a new one... so that’s gonna be like a “after christmas” gift for me)



Back to the story... after reaching my goal, I was still fascinated by the crypto world, so many different currencies and tokens, all this technology behind it, a new form of economy that was about to hit the world, one where we all had a chance of getting something more from what we are allowed by governments and this monopoly ruled by fat greedy pigs that control everything for their own benefit.



I remember leaving some $20s distributed in BTC, ETH and LTC, the idea of investing on crypto was always on my head, even if I didn't have enough money for that, or even if that meant making some excuse to my girlfriend (now future wife) for not going out to the movies more than once in that month… And the next one too lol. 



Got to save $100 in that month and bought BTC with my money for the first time. Which became small investments in many altcoins. Didn't sleep much many nights researching, learning and watching the market for a few nights, I even got to annoy my girlfriend because I “was always talking about bitcoin” she told me many times “If you want me to listen to you talking about that, talk me when you get a car out of it, then we talk, or at least show me when it becomes real money ” lol 



After doing my “homework” my chosen altcoins where ETH, LTC, OMG, QTUM, GNT and GNOIS, sadly I didn't hold them long enough before getting all back to BTC. I managed to get another $100 to invest a month later, I was still reading and learning about almost every well mentioned altcoin. The ones that I decided to buy were XRP, IOTA, XLM, NEO, ARK, EOS, ADA and of course some ETH and LTC. Even though that I had the interest in getting a few more, like ETC, TRX, POWR, SUB, BCH, KMD, ICX and maybe a few others, money was not enough.   



Time passes, a few months, where my $200 investment became almost $700, and the other $20 are almost $150 now, for a total of something around $850, which I’m cashing out, although I’m keeping 50 doge coins that someone on reddit gave me a few weeks back, lets hope it goes to the moon one day lol… 



Putting things on perspective, those $850 are $41,000 DOP, a little more than my monthly salary.

This didn't made my a millionaire like some lucky folks out there, nor gave me a car or a house, not even close, but this money and my Christmas/Thirteenth salary is going to be a relief now that I’m almost getting married, both (me & my gf) moving out from parents, and waiting for a baby together, paying for the all the marriage fees, rings, security/tenancy rental deposit, some medical appointments for her due the pregnancy and maybe some Christmas gifts for our families, but also, this gave me knowledge. 


I did learn a lot, I did socialize with many cool people on reddit and many telegram groups, also got to know this fascinating new world with many technologies that are changing the world and bringing with it a new economy that can beat the pigs and the monopoly under their control, one where they print all the money they want and have everything for their own benefit. 
 
it's amazing what cryptocurrencies has done for so much people, changing so many lives, it didn't made me a millionaire, but others have, so many young kids that were curious enough to put some interest on something useful, so many persistent people that jumped into this long ago waiting for this to change their life or just to get some extra money because the salary wasn't enough. Crypto gave me a possibility, it gave me a little bit of freedom, it gave me a better Christmas in difficult but wonderful times ahead. 



Good luck to you all, may the profits be with you all, make good investment, be smart, read, learn and win, not only money, because learning is winning. I hope you all reach your goals and maybe something more than that, some lambos or teslas and I hope to join you all again one day not too far, before the rocket reach the moon.



Merry Christmas for you crypto fellas.  

-------------------------

TLDR. This is a story of how I started mining with 1 GPU, how it took me months to reach my first goal, still fascinated by the crypto world, I kept learning about it. months later managed to get some extra cash ($200) to invest in many altcoins and btc which made almost 400% it didn't made me a millionaire, not even close, but got some extra money to help me starting my new life (paying security/tenancy rental deposit for moving out with my future wife, fees for our civil marriage and some medical appointments due expecting a baby) I’m left with no GPU to mine, only 50 doge and the desire of coming back one day before the rocket lands on the moon... But also with a lot of knowledge about new tech and knowing that there’s a new type of economy coming, one that gives more hope and freedom, knowing that the world is about to change.

ADA,Bitcoin,[03/16/2015] Mapofcoins.com New Update,"Guys! I am extremely happy to announce the **New update of http://mapofcoins.com.**


We’ve made a significant progress on the cryptocurrency library.  Mostly we’ve paid attention to the functional part.
Probably you remember a giant amount of coins which was put together in a chaotic way. From now on you can perform analysis of all cryptocurrency data.



With a brand new function you can now choose the **Specific Algorithm** like:


* SHA-2
* Scrypt
* Quark
* X11
* Boulderhash
* CryptoNight
* Wild Keccak
* Multi-Algo
* Others

and see the highlighted cryptocurrencies by the chosen Algo!


Another new feature is the division of cryptocurrencies into two groups: defunct & running. With the help of **“Condition” Filter** you can see which coins are developing and which are gone. If some cryptocurrencies become alive, I hope to receive a message from you. 


And the other thing that cannot go unnoticed is the **Visualization Part.**



To help you navigate with more convenience we've made big changes to the BTC coin tree. Now you can look at the map more thoroughly and find out which cryptocurrencies have been released on any particular month.

I hope that **http://mapofcoins.com** now could be a good place not only for looking through different cryptocurrencies within the time but also a great instrument for making marketing and business analysis.


P.S. Develop and stay tuned with the cryptocurrency world! ",3,2015-03-16 18:04:10,3

ADA,Bitcoin,A more concrete value,"(Disclaimer: this is my first post here.) 

I don't know very much about economics but I know a lot of people complain about the volatility of bitcoin and I read a comment today about how if you're a merchant you should just charge based what you think bitcoin is worth. I agree this is probably for the best and will help stabilize the value of the coin and make it more accessible and usable. [Dread Pirate Roberts](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCYQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fandygreenberg%2F2013%2F04%2F16%2Ffounder-of-drug-site-silk-road-says-bitcoin-booms-and-busts-wont-kill-his-black-market%2F&ei=QbgdU5-rDM6NkAfuloA4&usg=AFQjCNGe5VNwNBoN23stY0nHooajgxF6gw&sig2=Iv1vADaWTX4LIE6e4OXT9Q&bvm=bv.62578216,d.eW0), founder of Silk Road once said that prices on the silk road don't depend on the value of bitcoin because people tend to spend the money they make on SR on goods and services from SR. 

The majority of websites that take bitcoin I've seen (like Gyft) all have dynamically changing prices based on the value of bitcoin seen from websites like coinbase and Mt. Gox (back in the day). So what do you all think about setting concrete prices in bitcoin? How would it work and how would we get people to all do something like that?",0,2014-03-10 13:05:57,2

&#x200B;

* 2. Active Calculations
* As we launch on ADA mainnet, we will be bridging over and airdropping all holders of PRADA (BSC/ERC) proportional to their holdings of the new PRADA (ADA).

&#x200B;

* 3. Upon migration, one of the first tokens on ADA mainnet with stable liquidity and list of solid holders. Utility of the PRADA token after migration would be to facilitate builders with capital, marketing, and investors to help incubate projects from very talented builders.

&#x200B;

* 4. This means more airdrops, chances to speculate on early projects, and a strong tight knit community that believes in Cardano’s solution for smart contract scaling.",973,2021-09-14 09:41:57,318

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,📌Rewards Cardano - Just Launched ✅ Voice Chat Daily - Dev Doxxed Video voice chat every day🦎 Active Telegram Group ⭐️ Great Potential - Next x1000 Gem | 8% Rewards ADA,"


Tired of getting honeypotted or rugged? Well, so are we. The main reason we came together and formed the Rewards Cardano team is that we’ve lost tons of our money to scammers and wanted to do it right for the community. The community spoke and we listened! No more of that whitelist contest trash, only to end up getting dumped on by presalers. Let’s be real - those hard caps are way too high anyway.

📃Whitelist Applications – NONE OF THAT

🛎Presale: NOPE

🚀Launch: Fair

The rewards coin community has proven to be the most vibrant and robust community in the entire crypto space this altcoin season. Whether it’s because of Elon or our hope for quick gains, we’re here for you. Iconic meme coins that have made thousands of people millionaires, they all started as a joke. However, the Rewards Cardano team on the other hand, are very serious about this project and committed to making it a tremendous success for everyone; all the while getting their holders great gains. Rewards Cardano aims to be a simplistic growth and rewards token built on some of the most sophisticated technology in the entire crypto space – the Binance Smart Chain. We know that BSC tokens have been getting a bad rap recently with the amount of scams and want to be as transparent with our community as possible. We’re here to answer all of your questions.

What if you could speculate on crypto’s trends and earn rewards in the hottest altcoin right now?

Meet Rewards Cardano, the coin that also pays handsomely to its holders in another currency. This is a brand-new project, launching very very soon — and gaining traction every day, spreading mostly by word of mouth. We haven’t even taken the plastic off. The team is tight-lipped and plans on saving most of the marketing for after launch. The old “wen marketing” meme seems fitting here.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,"💎HappyDoge - Be happy, join the vibe! | Mature community | 111k Marketcap | Amazing marketing plans | Transparent devs | Developing defi platform for the Cardano network | Great potential","**Why should you give a special look at Happy Doge?**

Happy Doge is an interesting meme cryptocurrency capable of quick worldwide adoption. Happy Doge is different from Dogecoin: it is more technologically developed, has great tokenomics, and is able to generate much more profit to its holders!

**How does it compete to other meme coins?** 

Happy Doge is a community-driven digital currency which combines efficient transactions with next-generation DeFi-oriented features. While the original Dogecoin was a very simplistic cryptocurrency, Happy Doge is full of high quality functions which make it a much better asset for any blockchain investor.

**I am a member of the Happy Doge community for a week now! What have I seen so far?**

As a member of the community I have seen massive feedback from the team. They are very active on the telegram chat and also there is a voice chat where you can simply go and hear their thoughts and position related to the future of the coin. They have been transparent enough for me to fully trust their initiative and their brave goals.

**Why should you HODL? Check it out!**

Happy Doge collects a 6% tax on each transaction which occurs on its respected network, and the collected amount is stored in a smart contract. When a sale of Happy Doge occurs, a portion of that amount is utilized to automatically purchase tokens from the liquidity pool.

The purchased tokens are immediately burned and removed from the supply forever, which means that Happy Doge is a highly deflationary cryptocurrency. Because of that, the continuous rate of growth over time is guaranteed.

💰**Transaction fee deep dive**:

Rewards for holders: 2% 

Marketing :3% 

Buy-back :6% (keeps the price of the token in check)

Slippage recommended :13% 

**🚨Token Allocation**:

Liquidity :45% 

Initial burn: 45.5%

Marketing :5.5%

Dev tokens burned :4.84%

Dev tokens locked: 0.16%

💎**Tokenomics:**

Name: Happy Doge

Symbol: HADO

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000

Token Decimals: 9

**📝 Contract:** 

0x55654DF0005B2916b21A2ca5232c6768Ce86e24b

The entire LP will be locked for the first 365 days after the token launch. Thus, rapid growth of Happy Doge in the initial stage of the project is expected

**Happy Doge Roadmap**

Phase 1: (finished)

● Website and social media channels launched (finished)

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,DogeHouse Capital 🐕 | Official Website & Swap/DTF dApp Launch! 🏦 | $ADA Dividends & Rewards 💰| Cardano Bridge Coming Soon! 🌉LEGIT MOONSHOT.,"Invest Confidently on the Binance Smart Chain, Cardano Blockchain, and Beyond!

DogeHouse Capital is the only cryptocurrency project bringing professional digital asset management to meme-based digital currencies on the Binance Smart Chain, Cardano Blockchain, and beyond. At DogeHouse, we believe in investing in puppies with a purpose - not pump and dump ""shitcoins"".

DogeHouse Capital is not dependent on our BSC-based native token ($ DOGEX) to succeed. We will launch our native token on PancakeSwap (PCS) in/around mid September, but our project is much more than a typical BSC token.

DogeHouse Capital will also provide our members with an opportunity to purchase wrapped tokens modeled after Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) containing the world's top cryptocurrencies in a single token! That's a first in DeFi! More on this below...

Practical Utility at Launch

At launch, DogeHouse Capital will offer our investors a full suite of dApps including a staking platform and proprietary swap. Check out our thoughts on staking on Medium!

Furthermore, as mentioned above, we will also provide our users with an opportunity to trade the only professionally managed Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in DeFi called the Doge Traded Fund (DTF).

For years, Wall Street has tried to set-up an ETF for cryptocurrency, but the rigid regulatory nature governing our traditional financial markets has not allowed it to happen. In DeFi, no such regulations exist and tokenized versions that mirror traditional ETFs on Wall Street can be wrapped and traded via our one and only proprietary dApp!

For a limited number of investors, DogeHouse Capital will also offer an exclusive fund managed by us with a focus on the Cardano, Polkadot, and Kusama blockchain(s) and their associated infrastructure for steady annualized returns. Check out our philosophy on digital asset management on Medium!

Looking Ahead

There are a lot of ""Cardano Rewards"" projects hitting the ""shitcoin"" market these days, but few of them have any appreciation and/or conceptional understanding of why Cardano will revolutionize the industry.

At DogeHouse Capital, we are focused on investing in the future of DeFi - not the past. For this reason, we will focus on the development of our bridge to the Cardano Blockchain following our successful launch on PCS in/around mid-September 2021.

This course of action will provide our members with a practical utility that will enable them to transfer their $ADA pegged to $BNB rewards into the Cardano Native Token (CNT) in anticipation of the coming shift to the Cardano Blockchain.

We have big plans for the future and we want you to be a part of them. Consider investing with us today and pay us a visit!",978,2021-09-04 10:54:47,81

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,$TeslADA launch 🚀 at 6PM UTC 12/09 ADA Rewards. ready for Cardano Smart Contracts Today! ✔️,"TeslADA: Electrifying the BSC with 9% ADA Rewards and a Charged Up Team [Launching Today; 90k MC at launch]

I think I have found a real gem that is launching TODAY 6pm UTC on Sept 12th.

TeslADA features: ⚡️ 9% ADA Rewards. ⚡️ The best whitepaper I have read for a BSC project. ⚡️ A really friendly team that come across as honest and professional. ⚡️ A TG group that is full of actual people and not bots (shocking!). ⚡️ LP locked through Dx Sale

There was a presale through Dx Sale yesterday that reached its 120 BNB hard cap very quickly. It featured a small max 1 BNB contribution per person, and a soft whitelist to screen out snipers and bots from participating.

By now, everyone reading this has already been in several rewards tokens. I think the key to a successful one is a competent team that has the marketing nous to continue pushing awareness of the token after launch, which keeps transaction volume strong the weeks and months following launch.

How many times have we heard vague promises of “huge marketing plans” on launch day in a rewards token only for it to never eventuate? I would wager the reason marketing plans never eventuate is that most devs are out to take profit from investors over a couple of days following launch, disappear, and then start working on the next token. We’ve seen this so many times in the BSC over and over.

I really am confident that TeslADA has the vision and experience for success in this space, and with 30k of BNB in the marketing wallet on launch day it can really fly. They have lined up big marketing for launch day that will only snowball further into launch week.

For those interested in checking them out, below are some links to the website and whitepaper. Also, come and say hello in the official Telegram, you’ll also find communities in English, Chinese, Vietnamese, Brazilian Portuguese, and more languages to come!

Contract: 0x154697e2d1362796fd778044030079d8c184e0f8

&#x200B;

 Baby Cardano (bADA) is one of the most innovative & exciting projects in BSC right now, run by devs who have a beautiful vision for the coin’s future supported by a huge community behind it.

Thanks to a unique buyback system which places buy orders after each sale and burns those bought tokens, it guarantees a steady and flowless growth.

 This means that the profit for the coin is directly reapplied to the value of the coin’s Market cap and stopping the downward momentum of any dips, while also stabilizing the tokens volatility over time.

&#x200B;

Their Community-Shot function is another unique contract function that sets aside small token profits to inject directly to the LP for use at the disrection or the community & team when needed. All of these contract features are used in harmony to create a BSC token unlike any other

&#x200B;

 

On top of all of that this project holds weekly contests/giveaway, as the Dev team gives away unique prizes such as Airpods, laptops, etc!

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,"Cryptocurrency Arbitration: Cardano and XRP on Exchanges possible guys! Really useful information for trading
","Cryptocurrency arbitrage is one of the most attractive strategies for traders looking for ways to make money on the difference in asset prices on various trading exchanges. In this article, we will look at the possibilities of arbitrage using two popular cryptocurrencies — Cardano (ADA) and XRP (Ripple), as well as key points that should be taken into account when conducting such transactions.  
  
What is arbitration?  
Arbitrage in cryptocurrency trading is the purchase of an asset on one exchange, where its price is lower, and subsequent sale on another exchange, where the price is higher. The price difference arises from differences in supply and demand across platforms. This creates short-term profit opportunities if traders are willing to react quickly to market changes. The topic of arbitrage is quite extensive and therefore you can watch my individual arbitrage trading method on my verified YouTube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXHnhvObw8E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXHnhvObw8E)  
  
Why choose Cardano and XRP?  
Cardano (ADA) and XRP are two large cryptocurrencies with a high level of liquidity and widespread use on a variety of exchanges, which makes them ideal for arbitrage strategies.  
  
Cardano (ADA) is a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications that has attracted attention with its thoughtful architecture and strong development team. ADA is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies with a large number of trading pairs on different exchanges, which creates frequent arbitrage opportunities.  
  
XRP (Ripple) is a digital currency designed for instant global payments with minimal fees. Thanks to ultra-fast transactions, XRP is an ideal candidate for arbitrage, as it allows you to quickly move funds between exchanges, minimizing time delays.  
  
The main types of arbitration  
Several types of strategies can be used in arbitrage using Cardano (ADA) and XRP coins:  
  
Inter-exchange arbitrage: a classic strategy in which you buy ADA or XRP on one exchange, where the price is lower, and sell on another, where the price is higher. This requires a quick transfer of assets between platforms and monitoring of several exchanges at the same time.  
  
Arbitrage within the same exchange: In some cases, there may be price differences between different trading pairs on the same exchange. For example, ADA may be undervalued relative to BTC, but overvalued relative to ETH on the same exchange. This opens up opportunities for arbitrage without the need to transfer assets to other platforms.  
  
Triangulation arbitration: This is a more complex strategy that uses multiple trading pairs. For example, you can start with XRP, exchange it for ADA, and then for another cryptocurrency (for example, BTC) if this chain makes a profit.  
  
Advantages and features of arbitration with ADA and XRP  
Using Cardano and XRP for arbitrage has a number of advantages:  
  
Fast transactions with XRP: One of the key problems of arbitrage is the time to transfer funds between exchanges. XRP, thanks to its high speed and low fees, allows you to minimize waiting time and respond quickly to market opportunities.  
  
ADA Liquidity: Cardano has wide coverage on most major exchanges, which creates many trading pairs with this coin. Due to this, traders have a better chance of finding arbitrage opportunities.  
  
Low fees: Both XRP and ADA have low transaction fees, which makes them advantageous for arbitrage transactions where even small price fluctuations can be profitable.

For a limited number of investors, DogeHouse Capital will also offer an exclusive fund managed by us with a focus on the Cardano, Polkadot, and Kusama blockchain(s) and their associated infrastructure for steady annualized returns. Check out our philosophy on digital asset management on Medium!

Medium: https://medium.com/@dogehousecapital Looking Ahead

There are a lot of ""Cardano Rewards"" projects hitting the ""shitcoin"" market these days, but few of them have any appreciation and/or conceptional understanding of why Cardano will revolutionize the industry.

At DogeHouse Capital, we are focused on investing in the future of DeFi - not the past. For this reason, we will focus on the development of our bridge to the Cardano Blockchain following our successful launch on PCS in/around mid-September 2021.

This course of action will provide our members with a practical utility that will enable them to transfer their $ADA pegged to $BNB rewards into the Cardano Native Token (CNT) in anticipation of the coming shift to the Cardano Blockchain.

We have big plans for the future and we want you to be a part of them. Consider investing with us today and pay us a visit!!!",1002,2021-09-02 14:29:30,43
ADA,CryptoMoonShots,"🐔Kentucky Fried Cardano🐔 Fried? Cardano? Are you serious! Yes, Yes sir I am! An awesome combination – KFC and Cardano all combined into one package! Grab a bucket of KFC and earn some $ADA. Doxxed known devs and DOXXED 🐶DOG 🐶! – What you are waiting for??"," The dev here even doxxed his dog! The market is a little bit crazy but despite that this is serious. An opportunity to earn $ADA rewards while holding one of the most ultimate names that could possible be memed. Colonel Sanders handing out $ADA to holders. Who doesn’t want a piece of that!

The community sure does – this is growing like wildfire. There is some really sensational volume right now. The developers remain active and continue marketing. Tweets continue to fly in as do pinned messages. The community is super hyped and they continue to promote the project.

The shilling competitions do not stop and nor does the paid marketing. The community is really positive which is probably the most important thing in a token. The market is unpredictable and there are no guarantees. What is important is to have a safe place to play. 

The chart is continually moving in the right direction with constant sideways and also upwards momentum. I am not an expert in charting but it feels like it’s finding a strong floor at a $20k marketcap which is impressive for a coin that launched with a 3BNB liquidity pool.

There are no guarantees of anything. But maybe jump in and check this out. Over 6% of the tokens have been burned. The rewards are all coming through and with the manual claim you can stack your rewards without draining the contract of gas fees that reward people who earn 10 cents of rewards.

With a dedicated community, devs that are active and doxxed and a doxxed dog (that’s still making me LMAO 😂) This looks like a nice safe and enjoyable play. My only feedback is they don’t have a DJ. Nothing better than shilling and chilling while you listen to tunes.

I’m in the chat as well – so come in and say hi! Let’s see if this is one of those OG type moonshots from the earlier days!

What is $HADA?


Hyper Cardano is a hyper-deflationary token with a maximum  circulating supply of 100 Bllion on the Binance Smart Chain that  involves an inaccessible burn wallet. Depending on each holder’s  percentage of ownership, a 8% transaction tax is distributed as rewards  to the holders so the holders get to enjoy a never-ending cycle of  passive income with positive price pressure! This will greatly help the  ecosystem development and long-term sustainability.

➡️ 3 main features of autoPay Crypto:

&#x200B;

\* Automated reward system for holding autoPay tokens as ANY BSC token the community decides.  

The distributed reward token (for 48 hours) will be determined in Telegram polls.  

How will this work?  

\*We contact other project owners, tell them that we want to add them to our current reward poll and if they win the poll, their token will be distributed to autoPay holders for the next 48 hours as reward for holding autoPay.. in exchange, they advertise our poll in their Telegram channel and tell their investors to join our group and vote for their token.\*  

\*To prevent any voting fraud, only votes from voters which join the official autoPay chat will be counted.\*

\* Automated LP burn, which will turn collected tokens from taxes to LP tokens and then send them to the burn address immediately.

\* 20 BNB charity donations to Binance charities for each $1 Million market cap milestones reached (20 BNB at 1 Million, 20 BNB at 2 Million, 20 BNB at 3 Million etc.).

The communities of Dogecoin and Cardano have proven to be some of the most vibrant and robust communities in the entire crypto space this year. However, their stories couldn’t be more different.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,DogeHouse Capital 🐕 | Official Website & dApp Launch 🌐 | Utility w/Cardano Rewards 🛠 | Oversubscribed Whitelist! 👀,"Invest Confidently on the Binance Smart Chain, Cardano Blockchain, and Beyond!

DogeHouse Capital is the only cryptocurrency project bringing professional digital asset management to meme-based digital currencies on the Binance Smart Chain, Cardano Blockchain, and beyond. At DogeHouse, we believe in investing in puppies  with a purpose - not pump and dump ""shitcoins"".

DogeHouse Capital is not dependent on our BSC-based native token ($ DOGEX) to succeed. We will launch our native token on PancakeSwap (PCS) in/around mid September, but our project is much more than a typical BSC token. 

DogeHouse Capital will also provide our members with an opportunity to purchase wrapped tokens modeled after Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) containing the world's top cryptocurrencies in a single token! That's a first in DeFi! More on this below...

- Homepage: https://www.dogehousecapital.com/home 🏠

- Staking Platform (dApp): https://www.dogehousecapital.com/staking 🥩

- Swap/DTF: Coming Soon! 📈

- Cardano Bridge: Coming Soon! 🌉

Practical Utility at Launch

At launch, DogeHouse Capital will offer our investors a full suite of dApps including a staking platform and proprietary swap. Check out our thoughts on staking on Medium! 

Furthemore, as mentioned above, we will also provide our users with an opportunity to trade the only professionally managed Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in DeFi called the Doge Traded Fund (DTF).

For years, Wall Street has tried to set-up an ETF for cryptocurrency,  but the rigid regulatory nature governing our traditional financial markets has not allowed it to happen. In DeFi, no such regulations exist and tokenized versions that mirror traditional ETFs on Wall Street can be wrapped and traded via our one and only proprietary dApp!

For a limited number of investors, DogeHouse Capital will also offer an exclusive fund managed by us with a focus on the Cardano,  Polkadot, and Kusama blockchain(s) and their associated infrastructure  for steady annualized returns. Check out our philosophy on digital asset management on Medium!

Medium: https://medium.com/@dogehousecapital

Looking Ahead

There are a lot of ""Cardano Rewards"" projects hitting the ""shitcoin"" market these days, but few of them have any appreciation and/or conceptional understanding of why Cardano will revolutionize the industry. 

At DogeHouse Capital, we are focused on investing in the future of DeFi - not the past. For this reason, we will focus on the development of our bridge to the Cardano Blockchain following our successful launch on PCS in/around mid-September 2021. 

This course of action will provide our members with a practical utility that will enable them to transfer their $ADA pegged to $BNB rewards into the Cardano Native Token (CNT) in anticipation of the coming shift to the Cardano Blockchain. 

We have big plans for the future and we want you to be a part of them. Consider investing with us today and pay us a visit!

&#x200B;

💎 CONTRACT : 0xe1c21acb13ef954b4491fe2d87fa8fd5b2a20516

&#x200B;

The first and biggest Ethereum ETH reflection token and with the auto-claim feature.

&#x200B;

Simply hold METH tokens in your wallet and you'll earn ETH.

&#x200B;

In addition, there is a massive lottery mechanism.

&#x200B;

REWARD MECHANISM When you buy METH tokens you will receive a tracker token as a receipt for a purchase. Every 3 hours, the contract read the ledger to see how much you’ve owned against other holders. The reward is calculated by multiplying that ratio by the amount of tax gathered in each round. 2% of every buy/sell is taken and redistributed to all holders in the form of METH.

&#x200B;

AUTOMATIC PAYMENTS EVERY 3 HOURS you'll receive ETH every 3 hours, and won't have to claim it yourself. They're automatically sent to your wallet! As a result, the earlier you buy the tokens, the higher reward you will get a high reward (since you get more tokens with lower price)

&#x200B;

SECURED BY DESIGN The devs won't be able to remove liquidity! Liquidity will be locked  to ensure the safety of METH investors.

&#x200B;

Features of contract:

&#x200B;

LOW GAS TO CLAIM ETH Yes, We use very low gas to claim reward

This is the first auto-claim ADA token with the highest paying yields of up to 9%. Simply hold KADA tokens and get rewarded in ADA on every transaction.

***There’s NO waiting or need to claim your rewards. It happens instantly and automatically.***

The longer you hold KADA tokens, the more you earn in rewards and the closer you are to becoming the King. Why settle for 7-8% rewards or waiting around for your rewards when we can reward holders instantly with 9% from every BUY & SELL transaction!

Additionally, we the King Cardano protocol leads to a rise in price on EVERY transaction. 3% of each transaction gets bought back in the open market and burned forever, therefore increasing the value on everyone’s coins

&#x200B;

* *-Largest reflection token in ADA right now! 9% reflection*
* *-3% of every transaction is bought in the open market and then burned. Both those actions lead to an increase in value of the token and reduce the supply on each transaction. This token will continue to rise*
* *-3% for marketing and dev*
* *-$1M marketcap the first day it hits CMC with plenty of room to move*
* *-Supply matches Cardano. The goal is to peg it against ADA long term.* 
* *-Applied to all major listings and waiting. Still has chance to moon many more times.*
* *-Massive marketing campaigns with active ads running on reddit and poocoin*

Celebrating 🎉 ADA Smart Contract Launch

Incubating 🐣 the first deflationary token on the Cardano Network.

Redistributed ADA tokens on BSC in preparation for the ADA launch for all investors in different blockchains. 🚀

# ⏰ Launched 1 hour ago! ⏰

**Tokenomics:**

* Redistribution: 2%
* LP Pool: 1%
* Marketing/Liquidity for ADA token launch: 6%

💬 **Official Telegram:** [https://t.me/PartyADA](https://t.me/PartyADA)

🌎 **Website:** [https://www.partyada.io/](https://www.partyada.io/)

# What's all the hype about?

We are celebrating the long awaited launch of the smart contracts on Cardano's network. This is a huge milestone for all the investors of Cardano and people who have waited to build on the mainnet. This is why we want to get a head start on making sure our investors are ahead of the game.

&#x200B;

**Redistribution will have you prepared for the ADA's network with PartyADA.**

&#x200B;

1. BSC + ERC (multi-chain launch)

* Portion of taxes are saved for deflationary token liquidity on ADA mainnet when it launches. Holders are airdropped the main ADA PRADA token.

&#x200B;

* 2. Active Calculations
* As we launch on ADA mainnet, we will be bridging over and airdropping all holders of PRADA (BSC/ERC) proportional to their holdings of the new PRADA (ADA).

&#x200B;

* 3. Upon migration, one of the first tokens on ADA mainnet with stable liquidity and list of solid holders. Utility of the PRADA token after migration would be to facilitate builders with capital, marketing, and investors to help incubate projects from very talented builders.

&#x200B;

* 4. This means more airdrops, chances to speculate on early projects, and a strong tight knit community that believes in Cardano’s solution for smart contract scaling.",978,2021-09-14 21:38:23,22

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,"🔥XOADA | 150K market cap and growing | Doxxed Devs, Amazing Community, Cardano Rewards.","A forward-thinking Cardano rewards token.



What is XOADA?

XOADA is a Cardano (ADA) rewards token on the Binance Smart Chain. By holding XOADA, holders passively and automatically earn ADA.



About us

We are the California-based u/FDASHO development team, whose goal is to bring trustworthy and fair projects to investors. The development team is doxxed and regularly appears on video in the community telegram (t.me/XOADA).



Tokenomics

There is a total fixed supply of 100,000,000,000 tokens.



There is a 16% total fee applied to each XOADA transaction. This is broken down as follows:



7% is swapped to Binance-Peg ADA, sent to holders at amounts relative to their XOADA holdings.

5% is sent to the liquidity pool (originally 3%, but adjusted to address liquidity pool growth rate concerns.

4% is sent to the developer marketing wallet.



There is a maximum wallet size of 4% and a maximum transaction size of 2% of the total supply. This serves to curb the influence of whales, who without these measures would be able to decimate the market on large sells.



The developers maintain a 4% developer wallet, of which no tokens have been sold at the time of writing (August 17th, 2021). Should the developers ever decide to sell any tokens, they will be done in small increments over large time periods to ensure that the market is as unaffected as possible.



Safety

In addition to the aforementioned whale-proofing measures, XOADA’s liquidity is locked for one month (as of this time of writing), however this will be extended. The verified contract is not renounced, but this is because rewards tokens often need to adjust parameters in accordance with ever-changing market dynamics. For instance, we have increased the liquidity fee from 3% to 5% so that the liquidity pool would increase at a more proper rate with market capitalization. Rewards tokens with renounced contracts often fail because they are unable to adjust to the needs of the market, and a trusted development team able to react to these needs is crucial for such an asset to be a safe investment.



Marketing

We have plans for “outside of the box” marketing, including a YouTube vlog/documentary series about the development and a digital music festival/rave. These are just some of many ideas we have discussed and are likely to implement in the near future. In the meantime, we are of course committed to traditional marketing (Reddit, Twitter, Telegram call groups, listing websites, and more). So far we have been #1 on Coinvote three days in a row, had multiple trending CryptoMoonShot posts (one at #1), and have been tweeted by multiple Twitter influencers, including Crypto Maestro.

Hyper Cardano is a hyper-deflationary token with a maximum  circulating supply of 100 Bllion on the Binance Smart Chain that  involves an inaccessible burn wallet.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,✨ FCF (French Connection Finance) ✨ | Biggest crypto use case on BSC ⚡️ | Listed on 4 exchanges! Gate.io next✅ | Crypto Payment Gateway for Shopify & WooCommerce 🛍| NASDAQ partnership contract received ! | ✅ Passive Income paid in BNB daily! | ✅Innovative KYC/Doxxed Team,"French Connection Finance has received the partnership Contract from the NASDAQ listed corporation! THIS IS HUGE! The community have been waiting for this for the past 5 weeks! A top 3 global money transfering corporation has submitted a contract to FCF, THIS IS MAJORRRR!

**Beta testing of FCFPay begins on january 4th**

$FCF is a revolutionary token developing a cypto payment gateway that is integrating with the two biggest e-commerce platforms – WooCommerce & Shopify! Imagine paying on e-commerces with crypto! You could shop online and spend your crypto gains without having to send them to the bank. This would make Crypto the CASH of the internet!

This will allow FCF to unite the $4 trillion-dollar online shopping industry with the cryptocurrency world. This unification positions FCF as inevitable for mass adoption and secures the future of FCF as an essential crypto technology!

$FCF got listed on 4 exchanges in 4 weeks! LBANK, HOTBIT,COINSBIT AND LATOKEN. There is more to come! Dev is working on [GATE.io](https://gate.io/) and KUCOIN

The payment gateway will incentivize adoption by featuring a fee structure lower than PayPal and credit card processing companies.

Beta testing in December and going live in January, FCF Pay will allow you to buy flowers with BNB and order food with Cardano (or any other crypto) without requiring you to swap crypto for fiat and then transferring that into your bank account! Simply buy with your existing credit card using the FCF payment gateway!

Every payment gateway transaction will also induce a buy back and BURN mechanism in FCF, thereby increasing the value of your FCF by reducing the overall supply!

$FCF rewards holders with 5% BNB dividends based on trading volume AND when FCF Pay is launched, you will earn dividends on every payment gateway transaction! This safeguards your investment from bear markets by establishing a second source of dividend revenue! Imagine receiving a portion of the $4 trillion-dollar e-commerce industry simply by holding FCF!

FCF is also launching an NFT collection, The FrenchFellas!

The Dev is always active and always OVERDELIEVERS.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,⚡️ $FCF has booked a PLATINUM booth at the DUBAI crypto expo!| FCFPay Beta Phase is Live - Empowering Crypto 🚀 | 500+ Merchants already signed up for FCFPAY| Certik Audited| A true crypto-to-crypto payment gateway for ecommerce and physical retail stores | Earn Daily dividends on each transaction!,"French Connection Finance has booked a PLATINUM booth in the most prestigious crypto expo in the world!

FCF representatives will be attending CRYPTO EXPO DUBAI 2022 on March 16-17. They even have a 20-minute on-stage presentation that will broadcast FCF and FCFPAY to the world!   

Another exchange listing has been confirmed for the 3rd week of February! This will bring huge exposure to the project.

REBRANDING is imminent! In order to avoid any confusion whatsoever regarding the fact that FCF is 100% a utility project, a new corporate image is about to be revealed. The utility launch marketing plan will also begin in earnest in the days and weeks to come.

Over 500 Merchants have already signed up to accept crypto payments for their goods and services through FCFPAY!

$FCF is a revolutionary token developing a crypto payment gateway called FCFpay. It integrates with the two biggest e-commerce platforms – WooCommerce & Shopify. But FCFpay doesn’t stop there… The flexible API allows it to be integrated into practically any existing payment system, even in physical retail stores! In fact, a large proportion of the first merchants to use it will be physical stores.

Imagine paying directly with crypto! You will soon be able to shop online or in person, and spend your crypto gains without having to send them to the bank or use a “crypto credit card” that is actually just swapping your crypto for fiat. Crypto is about to fulfill its true purpose as the CASH of the internet!

FCF Pay will, for example, allow you to buy flowers with BNB and order food with Cardano (or any other crypto)... just about any combination you can imagine, and all without requiring you to use a traditional offramp, such as a centralized exchange.

This will allow FCF to unite the $4 trillion-dollar online shopping industry with the cryptocurrency world. This unification positions FCF to lead the way towards mass adoption and secures the future of FCF as an essential crypto technology!

That’s why their motto is “EMPOWERING CRYPTO”!

$FCF was already listed on 4 exchanges over a period of just 4 weeks! LBANK, HOTBIT, COINSBIT AND LATOKEN… and there are more to come! A new exchange listing has been confirmed for February.

The payment gateway will incentivize adoption by featuring a fee structure that is lower than PayPal and credit card processing companies.

Live Beta testing is underway right now! You can even go and try the early beta for yourself on the FCF merch store.

Every payment gateway transaction will also induce a buy back and BURN mechanism in FCF, thereby increasing the value of your FCF by reducing the overall supply!

$FCF rewards holders with BNB dividends based on trading volume (5% of each transaction goes to the dividend pool and is distributed proportionally) AND from a portion of transaction fees once 

FCFpay is launched. Yes, you will earn dividends on every payment gateway transaction! This safeguards your investment from bear markets by establishing a second source of dividend revenue! Imagine receiving a portion of the $4 trillion-dollar e-commerce industry simply by holding FCF!

As a great cherry on the cake, FCF has launched an NFT collection, The FrenchFellas! The collection is based on our spiritual leader, Gotto the French Bulldog.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,"✨ $FCF has booked a PLATINUM booth at the DUBAI crypto expo! 500+ Merchants already signed up for FCFPAY✨| FCFPay Beta Phase is Live, Empowering Crypto 🚀 | Earn Daily dividends on each transaction! | Certik Audited| A true crypto-to-crypto payment gateway for ecommerce and physical retail stores","French Connection Finance has booked a PLATINUM booth in the most prestigious crypto expo in the world!

FCF representatives will be attending CRYPTO EXPO DUBAI 2022 on March 16-17. They even have a 20-minute on-stage presentation that will broadcast FCF and FCFPAY to the world!

Another exchange listing has been confirmed for the 3rd week of February! This will bring huge exposure to the project.

REBRANDING is imminent! In order to avoid any confusion whatsoever regarding the fact that FCF is 100% a utility project, a new corporate image is about to be revealed. The utility launch marketing plan will also begin in earnest in the days and weeks to come.

Over 500 Merchants have already signed up to accept crypto payments for their goods and services through FCFPAY!

$FCF is a revolutionary token developing a crypto payment gateway called FCFpay. It integrates with the two biggest e-commerce platforms – WooCommerce & Shopify. But FCFpay doesn’t stop there… The flexible API allows it to be integrated into practically any existing payment system, even in physical retail stores! In fact, a large proportion of the first merchants to use it will be physical stores.

Imagine paying directly with crypto! You will soon be able to shop online or in person, and spend your crypto gains without having to send them to the bank or use a “crypto credit card” that is actually just swapping your crypto for fiat. Crypto is about to fulfill its true purpose as the CASH of the internet!

FCF Pay will, for example, allow you to buy flowers with BNB and order food with Cardano (or any other crypto)... just about any combination you can imagine, and all without requiring you to use a traditional offramp, such as a centralized exchange.

This will allow FCF to unite the $4 trillion-dollar online shopping industry with the cryptocurrency world. This unification positions FCF to lead the way towards mass adoption and secures the future of FCF as an essential crypto technology!

That’s why their motto is “EMPOWERING CRYPTO”!

$FCF was already listed on 4 exchanges over a period of just 4 weeks! LBANK, HOTBIT, COINSBIT AND LATOKEN… and there are more to come! A new exchange listing has been confirmed for February.

The payment gateway will incentivize adoption by featuring a fee structure that is lower than PayPal and credit card processing companies.

Live Beta testing is underway right now! You can even go and try the early beta for yourself on the FCF merch store.

Every payment gateway transaction will also induce a buy back and BURN mechanism in FCF, thereby increasing the value of your FCF by reducing the overall supply!

$FCF rewards holders with BNB dividends based on trading volume (5% of each transaction goes to the dividend pool and is distributed proportionally) AND from a portion of transaction fees once

FCFpay is launched. Yes, you will earn dividends on every payment gateway transaction! This safeguards your investment from bear markets by establishing a second source of dividend revenue! Imagine receiving a portion of the $4 trillion-dollar e-commerce industry simply by holding FCF!

As a great cherry on the cake, FCF has launched an NFT collection, The FrenchFellas! The collection is based on our spiritual leader, Gotto the French Bulldog.

&#x200B;

==========================================================

&#x200B;

$CHARLES is named after Charles Hoskinson - founder of Cardano - to show their respect to him.

The token has been created by [adacoin.hu](https://adacoin.hu) team!

&#x200B;

THE HIGHLANDER EFFECT: At every transaction, the hodlers are rewarded (7% of the traded value) by ADA token. The amount of the reward depends on the number of CHARLES tokens that you keep in your diamond hands. (Minimum 1.000.000 CHARLES token needed to get reward)

&#x200B;

Did you know that the [adacoin.hu](https://adacoin.hu) team runs a small but dedicated Cardano community in Hungary? They’ve been in the Cardano scene since December of 2020, when the team has started a Cardano news portal. A few months later they built their own Cardano stake pool (ticker: GULAS) and the community had started to grow rapidly. If you want to join them, we suggest GULAS pool to earn 5-7% APY with your redistributed ADA rewards.

&#x200B;

They did their first charity donation of 6500$. The Hungarian Child Rescue Foundation would like to build a new building to save child lives.

&#x200B;

After the website launch, they have recently submitted their listing request. 

&#x200B;

The number of holders is growing day by day. Join to become their newest holder before launching the bigger marketing campaign and listing. Be part of their stable community!

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,$LOBSTER 🦞 | Hottest Memecoin in CARDANO | Cardano shitcoin moonshot🚀| 19 days launched has x100 potential | Really early only 1 halving in 💎,"**$LOBSTER** \- Quintessentially decadent luxury good. 

I did my own research and always do yours.Not a financial advice, this is my first post, I am really interested in Cardano and I have done my research. These might sound like small numbers compared to other chains but trust me they are impressive.

Under the radar: Cardano memecoin at least x100 moonshot 🚀

Already a **95%** rise in trading volume in a few days

Only **1** halving have occurred and the second one is very close!

**$LOBSTER**: The royal memecoin that was destined to rule the Cardano metaverse. 

Why **$LOBSTER**? Because it was born a winner.

 Charles Hoskinson has a pet Lobster named Logan who sits on the mic next to him in every AMA session. 

THE FOUNDER of Cardano has a LOBSTER as his mascot and the most loyal companion. 

It is the perfect story leading up to an exploding $ADA memecoin. 

**A SUPERIOR LEVEL MEMECOIN IN COMPARISON TO THE COUNTLESS UNORIGINAL DOGGIE MEMECOINS**! 

A relatively new community, but already strong numbered and dedicated to the cause of making their King Logan known as THE memecoin on the Cardano blockchain.

The degen warriors are working hard tirelessly grinding at the Lobster Tank ATM and are building the future together with their $LOBSTER KING LOGAN! 

THE ATM EVEN GIVES OUT BLUE CHIP CARDANO NFTS TO HIS MOST LOYAL WARRIORS!

&#x200B;

What degens have accomplished so far: 

🦞**200,000** ATM transactions in less than 3 weeks.

🦞  **24,000** Wallets.

🦞**1,500** organic discord members with no bots in less than 5 days.

🦞The launch wasn’t shady and no influencers are backing this up. 

&#x200B;

**HAIL KING LOGAN, RULER OF THE OCEAN REALM AND KING OF THE 7 SEAS! LONG MAY HE REIGN!**

$PUMP Utility Token

MoonPump is a community-driven project that is set to disrupt the IDO space. Alongside the recent bull run the IDO space has exploded. Sure, it’s been great to be a part of and get onboard projects that have seen 1000X gains. However, the MoonPump community was tired of all the associated fees that the IDO platforms and their launchpads charged in order to list or invest in a project.

Invest in the IDO platform by holding their tokens to then have to invest again in a project just does not make sense.

Therefore, with an ever-growing community they decided to change the game. Currently under development is an easily accessible, transparent, and zero-cost platform where, in turn, token holders are rewarded by being given early access to the projects set to be launched.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,"Have You Been Looking For A Crosschain CARDANO and BSC IDO? Look No Further, PumpLaunch Is The Only IDO That Won't Require You To Hold Thousands Of Dollars Worth Of Its Native Token!","# Bringing to you the CARDANO and BSC IDO Revolution, PumpLaunch, as seen on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pumplaunch-making-idos-accessible-everyone-140000071.html?guccounter=1) and [Business Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/pumplaunch-making-idos-accessible-to-everyone-1030500171)! 

 \--

It's not just about gains, it's about the future. When Sean and his development team viewed the current IDO platforms, he noticed a problem. They all wanted you to purchase a hefty amount of tokens in order to have even the opportunity to create something. Why? Because these platforms didn't share the vision of the future, where everything and everyone has a token to call their own, true financial freedom and the truly free market.

Do you know who believes that is the future, who envisions it as such? **CZ himself**, right out of his mouth. If he knew what this team was doing, that they were sharing this revolutionary idea that would make his vision into a reality, he would be shilling this himself. [$PUMP'](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x5610bf2bf5abe5750bdbce311631dee2afa2cd24)s IDO known as PumpLaunch, is trying to create a platform for **EVERYONE**.

Most of the people who bought in the presale held their allocations and are eager to see this project develop. This morning when I woke up, I was pleasantly surprised to see people who used to spread FUD about this project to finally convert and become avid $PUMP supporters.

Besides the chance to claim allocations, no matter the amount of [$PUMP](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x5610bf2bf5abe5750bdbce311631dee2afa2cd24) you hold, you also get a chance to participate in the weekly tech giveaways. For every week that you hold [$PUMP](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x5610bf2bf5abe5750bdbce311631dee2afa2cd24), you get a chance win win things such as:

* Phones
* Gaming Computers
* Graphics Cards
* And Many More!

With PumpLaunch with its native token [$PUMP](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x5610bf2bf5abe5750bdbce311631dee2afa2cd24), you will always be a winner, as long as you HODL.

It’s free and open for participation, but is also Time Sensitive!","Mayz is a DeFi Protocol creating Crypto Funds/ Indexes, where you can create your own indexes, with any ratio of cryptocurrencies you want. Basically with this protocol, you can create, manage and acquire, a basket of tokens akin to the SP500 or the Nasdaq but for Crypto.   
They’re currently having an incentivized Testnet to stress test the protocol. It’s free and open for everyone to participate, but the timeline is limited as well as the number of individuals who will be eligible for an Airdrop. It’s also relatively easy to participate and become eligible, you just need to complete a few tasks, and the more tasks you complete the more of the Airdrop you can get.  
In this video we will show you step-by-step what you need to do to become eligible, and also what you can do to Maximize your rewards: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOIYJAnn25E   
We will also dive deeper into explaining what is the Protocol all about, and even analyze the tokenomics in order for you to be able to make your own decision on whether is worth it or not to participate in this Incentivised testnet.   
This is time-sensitive, so act fast to make the most out of this Opportunity. ",1,2024-03-26 18:47:55,3

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,Could any project on Cardano actually see a 1000X increase? What conditions would need to be verified? We dive deeper into that possibility in this post.,"The Cardano Ecosystem finds itself in a great position right now. We have projects that have recently launched their technologies, projects with very strong fundamentals, and with use cases that are needed.   
In addition, these projects are still very early stage, at least in terms of adoption, as they've just launched relatively recently, many during the bear market, and they still have a very low market Cap.   
For me, that screams opportunity, and I genuinely believe many of these projects will at least be able to pull a 100X, while others might even have a chance to pull a 1000X.   
In this video, I try to find the projects on Cardano that seem to have the highest likelihood of reaching a 1000X: https://youtu.be/skTYqYZ4M40?si=R0SCwTUurbBbQPrz   
I do explain my reasoning and all the processes and research I’ve done to reach these conclusions.   
While it’s not financial advice, it’s definitely an interesting and maybe even educational video on how to research projects further and might be valuable for your own research to find the best tokens to hold for this Bull Run. ",1,2024-04-02 16:52:56,1

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,📣CHARLES Token - Low buy fees (6%)?! Bridge to Cardano Network?! Easy 100X?! CG and CMC listing in progress?!📣,"Hello, thank you for taking a look at our post!

&#x200B;

The CHARLES token has a yield-generate contract on BSC (Binance Smart Chain) where the token holders get rewarded in ADA (BEP20). The mechanism incentivizes token holders to hold in order to earn dividends from the transactions. In the early stages we wanted to pay tribute to Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano and offer an alternative way to earn ADA for Cardano stake pool delegators. Also create a token on BSC that can be trusted and the liquidity not to be rug-pulled during overnight and last but not least do good and give back to the community (supporting the holders/delegators).

&#x200B;

In the medium term we want to provide farming and staking possibilities to our holders, and these advanced discussions have been taken forward.

&#x200B;

For the long term we are working on a utility that is a bridge between BSC and Cardano Network. With this option our holders can decide to stake ADA in a Cardano stake pool, hold them on hot wallets or transfer them to Cardano Network. 

At BSC we want to focus on the bridge as it would be a great opportunity for everyone to be able to transfer their funds easily from one network to another.

On the Cardano network we want to deploy our real-life use case token with a decent holder base.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,🚀 DEXI 🚀 [Collect cryptocurrency in AR (like Pokemon Go)] 🚀 [Wallet released this week] 🚀 [Long Term Project] 🚀,"The Dexioprotocol team are currently working hard on our new app wallet, it will be released this week. Our price is steadily growing day in day out and we are trending on coin market cap. Join our ever growing community on telegram and speak directly with our helpful team. 

Dexi is a newly released project that focuses on certain key targets in the world of cryptocurrency. Around 100 million people in the entire world are using cryptocurrency. A lot of people still do not know how to get into cryptocurrency and what cryptocurrency even is. We aim to solve this issue by introducing AR technology into the world of crypto. By combining AR with cryptocurrency, it unlocks a pathway where potential new investors have a fun and interactive way to collect crypto whilst also learning how to invest it wisely. This will not only increase the value of the crypto market as a whole but also protect new users from the affect of bear markets, pump and dumps, whales, and so forth.

So, what is Dexioprotocol? It is a new cryptocurrency launched on the Binance smart chain with a sticker symbol Dexi. It aims to implement a new new way of engagement to the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency using an Augmented reality application and crypto bounties place around the world. These token bounties will be available around the globe, think Pokémon go but catching crypto rather than Pokémon. The new app will also have your own private wallet (released this week), transaction tracking and of course an augmented reality camera allowing you to snap up those crypto bounties!

Events will be hosted through augmented reality. Our augmented reality bounties will offer great rewards when found. Our reason behind this is to offer a passive way to generate income by holding tokens, but also offer a way to make earning tokens more rewarding. Our bounties will take place around the globe and the app will notify the user when a bounty is near. All you need is your mobile phone. Do note that our puzzles will take effort to solve. But with great effort comes great reward!

Our project is developing a mobile application that is backed by our token. We’ll introduce people to AR(augmented reality bounties). People across the globe will be able to hunt token bounties that will get hosted as events. This will make earning cryptocurrency fun and rewarding. Our white paper and website describe this feature. I hope you take the time to read through it.

The team are also researching the cardano Alonso network, once released our development team will start developing on their network and investigate its many available possibilities.

For each dexi trade, three percent of it gets burnt, this increases its value in the long run. Three percent gets added to the liquidity pool and three percent gets rewarded to the holders of the token.

This system rewards the holders of the token and is a passive way of generating tokens. We are well established an have a great community on our discord and telegram sites. Join us today using the links below, you won’t want to miss out on the great opportunity!

DEXI is also a deflationary cryptocurrency:  
🔥 3% of tokens are burned during each transaction  
💎 3% of tokens are redistributed  
🚀 500,000,000,000 supply, of which 25% was burned already as voted by our telegram community.  
💎 Liquidity has been locked  
💎 Less than 1000 holders at the moment  
🔥 Entire Dexi team is already doxxed (see website for details)

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,"💎dexIRA ($DEX) 💎 20% Rewards 🚀 Rewards in BNB, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Link, Polkadot, Doge, Safemoon, Cardano & more! 🎊 Listed on CoinMarketCap & CoinGecko ✖️Don't miss this sleeping giant!","**What Is dexIRA (DEX)?**

Hi guys! You are searching for a legit token! Then check dexIRA! dexIRA provides fully automated multi-currency dividend rewards, advanced buyback protocols and tokenomics that promote long term holding and wealth generation.

Here the telegram and Website:

💬 Telegram: [https://t.me/dexIRA](https://t.me/dexIRA)

🌐 Website: [https://dexIRA.com/](https://dexira.com/)

Here some short information about it:

💎 An Individual Retirement Account designed specifically for Decentralized Exchanges.

💎 dexIRA is the first token with multi-currency rewards, advanced buyback protocols and

💎 Tokenomics that promote long term hodling and wealth generation.

🚀 Rewards holders in BNB, BTC, ETH, LINK, DOT, DOGE, SAFEMOON, ADA, BUSD, SAFEMOON and MORE! 🎊

The platform is based on the synergy of two concepts: DEX (decentralized exchanges) and IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts). Borrowing from the long-term investment idea behind a traditional IRA, dexIRA investors can grow their holdings commission-free similar to tax-free IRA contributions. This allows members to increase their stake in the reward pool over time without sacrificing initial capital.

After a one-year holding period, investors can sell their $DEX holdings tax-free and penalty-free. However, similar to the age restrictions on a traditional IRA, if holders choose to sell early, they're penalized.

Investors are protected even when $DEX tokens are sold and the price drops because they are rewarded with two thirds of all fees collected. Similarly, the dexIRA contract includes enhanced token buyback protocols to spur growth and anti-whale measures to prevent large one-off sell orders.

**Key features of dexIRA**

✅ Get 20% rewards

✅ Auto-claimed Multi-Currency Reflections

✅ Automatic Liquidity Pool

✅ Friendly Wale Buyback & Burn

✅ No mint token

✅ Anti Whale Dumps

✅ Burned LP

✅ No Tax on Buy Orders

✅ No rebase token

✅ Sell tax removed after 1yr hodling

✅ Funds Are Safu

**Whats so special? And why is it mooning?**

The strategy is simple: Incentivize new investment by waiving fees when purchasing dexIRA tokens. Support long-term growth by providing rewards and penalizing speculative short-term traders.

dexIRA was created to shift the mindset of investors and prove that cryptocurrencies can be stable, value-appreciating assets if the tokenomics support a long-term investment goal

Buy $DEX tokens without fees, use them to automatically collect and manage a diverse array of curated tokens in the following cryptocurrencies: BNB, BUSD, BTCB, ETH, DOGE, CAKE, XRP, LITE, LINK, DOT, ADA. SAFEMOON, ATOM, MATIC, TETHER, 1INCH, BUNNY.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,🚀 DEXI [No. 2 Trending on CMC] 🚀 [Collect cryptocurrency in AR (like Pokemon Go)] 🚀 [Wallet releasing in several days] 🚀 [Long Term Project] 🚀,"Dexioprotocol is currently tredning on coin market cap at no 2. Join us and push us up to the number 1 spot. The dexi app wallet will be released to the public in the next 2 to 3 days. Join us quickly as the price is currently skyrocketing! 

Dexi is a newly released project that focuses on certain key targets in the world of cryptocurrency. Around 100 million people in the entire world are using cryptocurrency. A lot of people still do not know how to get into cryptocurrency and what cryptocurrency even is. We aim to solve this issue by introducing AR technology into the world of crypto. By combining AR with cryptocurrency, it unlocks a pathway where potential new investors have a fun and interactive way to collect crypto whilst also learning how to invest it wisely. This will not only increase the value of the crypto market as a whole but also protect new users from the affect of bear markets, pump and dumps, whales, and so forth.

So, what is Dexioprotocol? It is a new cryptocurrency launched on the Binance smart chain with a sticker symbol Dexi. It aims to implement a new new way of engagement to the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency using an Augmented reality application and crypto bounties place around the world. These token bounties will be available around the globe, think Pokémon go but catching crypto rather than Pokémon. The new app will also have your own private wallet (released this week), transaction tracking and of course an augmented reality camera allowing you to snap up those crypto bounties!

Events will be hosted through augmented reality. Our augmented reality bounties will offer great rewards when found. Our reason behind this is to offer a passive way to generate income by holding tokens, but also offer a way to make earning tokens more rewarding. Our bounties will take place around the globe and the app will notify the user when a bounty is near. All you need is your mobile phone. Do note that our puzzles will take effort to solve. But with great effort comes great reward!

Our project is developing a mobile application that is backed by our token. We’ll introduce people to AR(augmented reality bounties). People across the globe will be able to hunt token bounties that will get hosted as events. This will make earning cryptocurrency fun and rewarding. Our white paper and website describe this feature. I hope you take the time to read through it.

The team are also researching the cardano Alonso network, once released our development team will start developing on their network and investigate its many available possibilities.

For each dexi trade, three percent of it gets burnt, this increases its value in the long run. Three percent gets added to the liquidity pool and three percent gets rewarded to the holders of the token.

This system rewards the holders of the token and is a passive way of generating tokens. We are well established an have a great community on our discord and telegram sites. Join us today using the links below, you won’t want to miss out on the great opportunity!

DEXI is also a deflationary cryptocurrency:  
🔥 3% of tokens are burned during each transaction  
💎 3% of tokens are redistributed  
🚀 500,000,000,000 supply, of which 25% was burned already as voted by our telegram community.  
💎 Liquidity has been locked  
💎 Less than 1000 holders at the moment  
🔥 Entire Dexi team is already doxxed (see website for details)

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,📣CHARLES Token - Low buy fees (6%)?! Bridge to Cardano Network?! Easy 100X?! CG and CMC listing in progress?!📣,"Hello, thank you for taking a look at our post!

&#x200B;

The CHARLES token has a yield-generate contract on BSC (Binance Smart Chain) where the token holders get rewarded in ADA (BEP20). The mechanism incentivizes token holders to hold in order to earn dividends from the transactions. In the early stages we wanted to pay tribute to Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano and offer an alternative way to earn ADA for Cardano stake pool delegators. Also create a token on BSC that can be trusted and the liquidity not to be rug-pulled during overnight and last but not least do good and give back to the community (supporting the holders/delegators).

&#x200B;

In the medium term we want to provide farming and staking possibilities to our holders, and these advanced discussions have been taken forward.

&#x200B;

For the long term we are working on a utility that is a bridge between BSC and Cardano Network. With this option our holders can decide to stake ADA in a Cardano stake pool, hold them on hot wallets or transfer them to Cardano Network. 

At BSC we want to focus on the bridge as it would be a great opportunity for everyone to be able to transfer their funds easily from one network to another.

On the Cardano network we want to deploy our real-life use case token with a decent holder base.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,What are the Projects Building on Cardano that you believe have the most potential both for the Long-run and for the Short-run? Will you be investing in them? ADA Token,"We’re coming closer to the next bull run and I believe we now have a huge opportunity in the Cardano Ecosystem.  
Contrary to the prior bear market, we now have smart contracts and some amazing projects already built and being used on Cardano.  
I believe these Early-Stage projects, even though risky can have an incredible potential for the next bull market, as long as we are able to select the ones that seem to have the most potential.  
That is exactly what I try to do in this video, where I create a list of the top 5 projects with the highest potential on the Cardano Ecosystem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af9ZnlRKkd0  
These are projects from different areas, with different narratives, and all projects that have already something to show and have had a decent impact either in the Cardano Ecosystem or in the real world.   
All the projects have tokens, even though the tokenomics are very different and some have better tokenomics than others.   
What are the projects you believe are missing here and that have incredible potential? And most importantly why do you think they have potential?",10,2023-12-11 20:21:47,2

⚡️Telegram: https://t.me/MiniEthToken

⚡️ Contract : 0x62505d8074b0ee0a93d08d78f1469c1f4ac6d38c

⚡️ Buy : 

https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x62505d8074b0ee0a93d08d78f1469c1f4ac6d38c

The first and biggest Ethereum ETH reflection token and with the auto-claim feature.

Simply hold MINIETH tokens in your wallet and you'll earn ETH.

In addition, there is a massive lottery mechanism.

Total supply : 1,000,000,000,000 

2% Buy tax / Sell tax 2% , Rewards 2% METH

REWARD MECHANISM When you buy MiniETH tokens you will receive a tracker token as a receipt for a purchase. Every 3 hours, the contract read the ledger to see how much you’ve owned against other holders. The reward is calculated by multiplying that ratio by the amount of tax gathered in each round. 2% of every buy/sell is taken and redistributed to all holders in the form of METH.

AUTOMATIC PAYMENTS EVERY 3 HOURS you'll receive ETH every 3 hours, and won't have to claim it yourself. They're automatically sent to your wallet! As a result, the earlier you buy the tokens, the higher reward you will get a high reward (since you get more tokens with lower price)

SECURED BY DESIGN The devs won't be able to remove liquidity! Liquidity will be locked  to ensure the safety of MiniETH investors.

Features of contract:

LOW GAS TO CLAIM ETH Yes, We use very low gas to claim reward

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,BINANCE SMART CHAIN TOKEN CALLED SPACEMAN (public team info and plan to build a decentralized exchange in Cardano main chain),"***Disclaimer: This is an analysis developed by myself so do not forget to do DYOR***

&#x200B;

***Team info is public***: [spaceman.lol](https://spaceman.lol)

&#x200B;

Spaceman lol team proudly announced to its token holders and future token holders about their large plans to build a Decentralized Exchange on the Cardano main chain while building one of the strongest communities in the crypto market. Differently from other bsc token projects they have their team information public. Moreover they decided to launch two roadmaps, one made by the dev team and the other done by the marketing team. Both roadmaps focus on building a great product with a great community around it. 

Since the beginning, everyone was wondering why a project with a public team never shared their roadmap. They took their time to release their roadmap because they wanted to do a great job and not let their token holders down. 

Well, the real work starts when you release your roadmap and that's what Spaceman will start to do. Their development team already started learning Plutus (cardano smart contract platform)  under the Plutus Pioneer Program where some of their developers are currently enrolled. They  decided to migrate to Cardano because it prioritizes safety and they pretend to be a pioneer in Cardano main chain. Spaceman project aims to revolutionize the crypto market with an amazing product. They pretend to help early projects in Cardano main chain to get listed in a user friendly decentralized exchange. Hence, although they started as a bsc token project their goal is to build a deflationary token under Cardano mainnet which code will be available for other projects to create their own deflationary tokens under Cardano main chain and using reflection as the super ingredient to get the liquidity needed. In addition, they would love these projects to get fees paid in their own token insead of being paid in ADA. 

For the marketing plan they pretend to achieve several listings as well as auditions to help the availability of their token to everyone. Moreover, their marketing team is ready to build a great community through social media interactivity and by thinking outside of the box, by creating new forms of digital marketing. Both the marketing and development team will work hand in hand to build a great financial product and services through their future Decentralized Exchange, which will be named Syllena DEX or Syllena Decentralized Exchange.  

Both roadmaps are divided by 3 phases which are Mercury, Gemini and Apollo Program. Spaceman project hopes that everybody will be more comfortable with their project after reading their roadmaps.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,"Up until now, only the big fish could access IDOs and make a ton of money. Now PumpLaunch, swings open the doors to everyone. In June this amazing project and cross-chain partnership with Cardano will come to fruition!"," [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pumplaunch-making-idos-accessible-everyone-140000071.html)

[Article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pumplaunch-making-idos-accessible-everyone-140000071.html)[Business Insider Article](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/pumplaunch-making-idos-accessible-to-everyone-1030500171)

A new project emerged in May that has already attracted intense attention from the crypto community. Before even going live, MoonPump a.k.a. $PUMP (PumpLaunch's token) attracted over 30k twitter users and 25k telegram followers, in days.

The evident hype stems from the fact that [PumpLaunch](http://pumplaunch.com/) lets people participate in Initial DEX Offerings with no barriers and no minimum buy-ins. Everyone now has the unprecedented opportunity to make money from crypto projects during their earliest stages.

$PUMP will create a new category-defining crosschain IDO platform, [PumpLaunch](http://pumplaunch.com/). Not only will the platform tailor to the specific needs of each individual project launched, but $PUMP fills in the current market gap by connecting more investors to each project it launches. [PumpLaunch](http://pumplaunch.com/) provides full bespoke service from start to finish for every launch while providing all $PUMP holders, regardless of allocation, access to incredible crypto projects.

[PumpLaunch](http://pumplaunch.com/) invites all holders to participate without minimum buy-ins or restrictions. As long as the user holds $PUMP, they can access an allocation of every project on [PumpLaunch](http://pumplaunch.com/).

This community driven platform excludes no one and provides unbiased access to tokens before they moon.  
In addition to IDO accessibility, $PUMP holders receive ecosystem privileges such as first access, voting rights, staking rewards, and an allocation of project tokens.

What separates $PUMP from the rest? Built on the Binance Smart Chain, $PUMP offers accessibility, low gas fees, and easy access. $PUMP also offers proper utility and initially will focus all time, energy, and money on the IDO Platform.

After launching on the Binance Smart Chain $PUMP will eventually migrate over to the Cardano testnet, making $PUMP available on both chains. [PUMPLAUNCH](http://pumplaunch.com/) is the launchpad the world has been waiting for, built for the people.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,$NEBULA: A New Star in the Cardano Blockchain Universe,"Hey fellow crypto enthusiasts!  I wanted to take a moment to introduce you to a project that's caught my attention recently: $NEBULA

$NEBULA is a Web3 project that's aiming to bridge the gap between different communities within the Cardano ecosystem. The team behind $NEBULA is focused on creating assets that can be easily reskinned and licensed to other communities, with a particular focus on gamification and gambling. 

The team has big plans for the future. They're working on expansions that will introduce captivating casino mechanisms and upcoming gamification that will take your gaming experience to new heights.

$NEBULA also has a unique token distribution plan. They will use 60% of tokens to distribute to holders over a 10+ year period based on holdings, staking, farming, missions, and more.

If you're looking for a project that's not just about the token but also about creating a whole new world within the Cardano blockchain, I highly recommend checking out $NEBULA. It's a project that's truly lost in space-time, and I can't wait to see where it goes next! 🌌

💎 dexIRA is the first token with multi-currency rewards, advanced buyback protocols and

💎 Tokenomics that promote long term hodling and wealth generation.

🚀 Rewards holders in BNB, BTC, ETH, LINK, DOT, DOGE, SAFEMOON, ADA, BUSD, SAFEMOON and MORE! 🎊

The  platform is based on the synergy of two concepts: DEX (decentralized  exchanges) and IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts). Borrowing from the  long-term investment idea behind a traditional IRA, dexIRA investors  can grow their holdings commission-free similar to tax-free IRA  contributions. This allows members to increase their stake in the reward  pool over time without sacrificing initial capital.

After  a one-year holding period, investors can sell their $DEX holdings  tax-free and penalty-free. However, similar to the age restrictions on a  traditional IRA, if holders choose to sell early, they're penalized.

Investors  are protected even when $DEX tokens are sold and the price drops  because they are rewarded with two thirds of all fees collected.  Similarly, the dexIRA contract includes enhanced token buyback protocols  to spur growth and anti-whale measures to prevent large one-off sell  orders.

**Key features of dexIRA**

✅ Get 20% rewards

✅ Automatic Liquidity Pool

✅ Burned LP

✅ Friendly Wale Buyback & Burn

✅ No mint token

✅ Anti Whale Dumps

✅ Auto-claimed Multi-Currency Reflections

✅ No Tax on Buy Orders

✅ No rebase token

✅ Sell tax removed after 1yr hodling

✅ Funds Are Safu

**Whats so special? And why is it mooning?**

The  strategy is simple: Incentivize new investment by waiving fees when  purchasing dexIRA tokens. Support long-term growth by providing rewards  and penalizing speculative short-term traders.

dexIRA  was created to shift the mindset of investors and prove that  cryptocurrencies can be stable, value-appreciating assets if the  tokenomics support a long-term investment goal

Buy  $DEX tokens without fees, use them to automatically collect and manage a  diverse array of curated tokens in the following cryptocurrencies: BNB,  BUSD, BTCB, ETH, DOGE, CAKE, XRP, LITE, LINK, DOT, ADA. SAFEMOON, ATOM,  MATIC, TETHER, 1INCH, BUNNY.

FCF representatives will be attending CRYPTO EXPO DUBAI 2022 on March 16-17. They even have a 20-minute on-stage presentation that will broadcast FCF and FCFPAY to the world!

Official partnership with the marketing company Chambers group rolling out in the upcoming few days. Over 100k being used for brand awareness and exposure!

REBRANDING is completed! In order to avoid any confusion whatsoever regarding the fact that FCF is 100% a utility project, a new corporate image has been revealed. The utility launch marketing plan will also begin in earnest in the days and weeks to come.

Over 500 Merchants have already signed up to accept crypto payments for their goods and services through FCFPAY!

Discover our Revenue Sharing Token Ecosystem! (RST) A real world product(FCFpay) that keeps fueling our investor token $FCF!

$FCF is a revolutionary token developing a crypto payment gateway called FCFpay. It integrates with the two biggest e-commerce platforms – WooCommerce & Shopify. But FCFpay doesn’t stop there… The flexible API allows it to be integrated into practically any existing payment system, even in physical retail stores! In fact, a large proportion of the first merchants to use it will be physical stores.

Imagine paying directly with crypto! You will soon be able to shop online or in person, and spend your crypto gains without having to send them to the bank or use a “crypto credit card” that is actually just swapping your crypto for fiat. Crypto is about to fulfill its true purpose as the CASH of the internet!

FCF Pay will, for example, allow you to buy flowers with BNB and order food with Cardano (or any other crypto)... just about any combination you can imagine, and all without requiring you to use a traditional offramp, such as a centralized exchange.

This will allow FCF to unite the $4 trillion-dollar online shopping industry with the cryptocurrency world. This unification positions FCF to lead the way towards mass adoption and secures the future of FCF as an essential crypto technology!

That’s why their motto is “EMPOWERING CRYPTO”!

$FCF was already listed on 4 exchanges over a period of just 4 weeks! LBANK, HOTBIT, COINSBIT AND LATOKEN… and there are more to come!

The payment gateway will incentivize adoption by featuring a fee structure that is lower than PayPal and credit card processing companies.

Live Beta testing is underway right now! You can even go and try the early beta for yourself on the FCF merch store.

Every payment gateway transaction will also induce a buy back and BURN mechanism in FCF, thereby increasing the value of your FCF by reducing the overall supply!

$FCF rewards holders with BNB dividends based on trading volume (5% of each transaction goes to the dividend pool and is distributed proportionally) AND from a portion of transaction fees once

FCFpay is launched. Yes, you will earn dividends on every payment gateway transaction! This safeguards your investment from bear markets by establishing a second source of dividend revenue! Imagine receiving a portion of the $4 trillion-dollar e-commerce industry simply by holding FCF!

Become an FCF affiliate! Earn a stream of income of 0.1% off every transaction processed through FCFpay for 3 years upon having a merchant implementing FCFpay with your affiliate link! 

Refer your friends and family to purchase $FCF token with transactions over 1500$ and earn 1.5% of the transaction as a commission and have the new investor get a 3% refund!

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,The Best Alternative to Cardano Staking.,"In the world of cryptocurrency, Cardano staking has gained substantial popularity as a method for earning passive income. However, there's a rising alternative that's capturing the attention of savvy investors, and that is masternodes. Projects like Morpheus Network and DASH are proving that masternodes can be a powerful and rewarding alternative to Cardano staking.  
  
While Cardano staking involves holding ADA tokens to participate in the network's proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, masternodes offer a different approach. Masternodes are specialized nodes in blockchain networks that perform advanced functions beyond transaction validation. By operating a masternode, individuals contribute to the network's functionality and security while earning rewards in the form of cryptocurrency.  
  
Morpheus Network is a prime example of how masternodes can revolutionize industries beyond finance. By staking its native $MNW tokens to operate masternodes, participants play a crucial role in optimizing global supply chain management. The rewards they earn aren't just monetary; they also contribute to streamlining international trade operations, making this alternative approach impactful and rewarding. With a MC of only $53M, they provide an ROI of 18% and are available for 1800 $MNW per node.  
  
DASH, a pioneering cryptocurrency, has showcased the potential of masternodes for years. Operating a DASH masternode involves staking a certain amount of DASH tokens, allowing participants to earn rewards while supporting advanced features like InstantSend and PrivateSend. This demonstrates that masternodes can serve as a dynamic alternative to traditional staking, presenting unique benefits to investors. With a MC of $338M, $DASH nodes will give you an ROI of 6.8%.  
  
As the crypto landscape evolves, exploring alternatives to staking methods like Cardano's can open doors to new opportunities. Masternodes, as exemplified by projects such as Morpheus Network and DASH, offer a way to engage with blockchain networks while earning rewards and participating in the growth of innovative ecosystems.",1,2023-10-28 12:15:22,1

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,Dexi is now listed on coinmarketcap and app is due out imminently.,"Dexioprotocol app wallet will be released to our beta testers imminently. Join us now to get in early before the price skyrockets!

Dexi is a newly released project that focuses on certain key targets in the world of cryptocurrency. Around 100 million people in the entire world are using cryptocurrency. A lot of people still do not know of the many possibilities of cryptocurrency. We aim to solve that by introducing AR technology into the world of crypto.

So, what is Dexioprotocol? It is a new cryptocurrency launched on the binance smart chain with a sticker symbol dexi. It aims to implement a new new way of engagement to the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency using an Augmented reality application and crypto bounties place around the world. These token bounties will be available around the globe, think Pokémon go but catching crypto rather than Pokémon. The new app will also have your own private wallet (released this week), transaction tracking and of course an augmented reality camera allowing you to snap up those crypto bounties!

Events will be hosted through augmented reality. Our augmented reality bounties will offer great rewards when found. Our reason behind this is to offer a passive way to generate income by holding tokens, but also offer a way to make earning tokens more rewarding. Our bounties will take place around the globe and the app will notify the user when a bounty is near. All you need is your mobile phone. Do note that our puzzles will take effort to solve. But with great effort comes great reward!

Our project is developing a mobile application that is backed by our token. We’ll introduce people to AR(augmented reality bounties). People across the globe will be able to hunt token bounties that will get hosted as events. This will make earning cryptocurrency fun and rewarding. Our white paper and website describe this feature. I hope you take the time to read through it.

The team are also researching the cardano Alonso network, once released our development team will start developing on their network and investigate its many available possibilities.

For each dexi trade, three percent of it gets burnt, this increases its value in the long run. Three percent gets added to the liquidity pool and three percent gets rewarded to the holders of the token.

This system rewards the holders of the token and is a passive way of generating tokens. We are well established an have a great community on our discord and telegram sites. Join us today using the links below, you won’t want to miss out on the great opportunity!

DEXI is also a deflationary cryptocurrency:

🔥 3% of tokens are burned during each transaction  
💎 3% of tokens are redistributed  
🚀 500,000,000,000 supply, of which 25% was burned already as voted by our telegram community.

They have been in chat for months and working harder than a beaver on a concrete post. Their presale yesterday sold out in 13 minutes and, with a $1.5 Million Market Cap to start with, todays' launch is going to be incredible!

The launch of this project in May 2021 was really positive. Their first reward token in their eco-system, CardanoEvo, has been a huge success, listed on CMC, CG, Crypto,com.

The project has been running since May 2021. As well as delivering over $1/2 Million of Cardano rewards to investors thus far, the project continues to evolve. Since inception, they have launched their website, Their EvoDashboard and their Merchandise Store.

Further developments have seen the successful launch of their Dex exchange – EvoSwap and their own token being listed on further exchanges such as Coinsbit.

Now they are deploying their ‘Hub’ Utility token – Evolution (Evo). This utility token will drive their own ecosystem of reward tokens, allowing for staking with rewards; and NFT trading on their EvoNFT Dapp.

But that’s not all… As well as rewarding Evo holders with reflections, there is a revolutionary new feature called EvoBoost. Check out their website and see how it works!

This industrious team have continued their doxxing process on their website; and are actively engaged with the community every day. Social channels have been successfully launched on Telegram, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, with followings increasing daily.

As with the CardanoEvo (cEvo) reward token, Evolution (Evo) is listing on many minor listing sites and applications will be submitted to CMC and CG upon launch.

Techrate Audit will be carried out prior to launch and the extra good news is that it is going to be on public pre-sale on PinkSale 29th November.

This team have delivered on all of their promises, and Evolution (Evo) promises to be another HUGE success. They are a community-led project, delivering the will of their investors in a professional, ethical, legitimate and effective manner.

They are CardanoEvo, They are now Evolution as well.

**WHAT IS BIT RIVALS?**

**Bit Rivals** is the ultimate platform for gamers. Bringing together the best that gaming and crypto has to offer through a feature-packed ecosystem powered by the **$RIVAL Token**.

Their mission is to level the playing field for gamers of all skill levels by providing more opportunities to earn rewards than their competitors, who focus almost exclusively on high stake eSports tournaments. Bit Rivals combines the best of both worlds, with a platform that’s built for the casual Sunday gamer, but can accommodate even the most skilled competitors.

They aim to become a leader in the global crypto marketplace by tapping into the value and possibilities of the world gaming market, which is already valued at over 170 billion USD and expected to double in value by 2026.

**WHAT’S SO SPECIAL?**

What differentiates Bit Rivals from other competitors is the level of integration that the platform provides, the utility of their token and the inclusivity of their platform. Most competitor platforms tend to cater for the most elite of players as a way to reach the eSports community and earn sponsorships. Bit Rivals, however, offers a variety of ways that players of any skill level can get involved, including level-capped tournaments and a play to earn system that rewards gamers just for playing their favorite games! And unlike other sites, Bit Rivals puts 100% of its platform fees back into the ecosystem’s tournament and rewards wallet to keep the rewards flowing.

The Bit Rivals ecosystem is made up of five different zones, each having its own set of features that provide ways for players to earn rewards. All you need to do to get access to the platform is sign-up for a Rival ID. Your Rival ID is your ultimate gamer profile. As you progress in your favorite games, you’ll earn badges and achievements that you can use to show off your skills and customize your profile, along with unique backgrounds, avatars, and titles that you can earn through Rival Rewards.

🏆 **RIVAL ARENA**

Win $RIVAL by participating in our official tournaments or create your own private or public tournaments with customized dates, times, entry fees, and more! You can even test your hand at becoming an organizer by regularly hosting and marketing your own tournaments. By becoming a reputable organizer, you’ll not only be able to collect an organization fee for each tournament you host, but you’ll also be able to apply for funding from the tournament wallet to fund your tournaments’ prize pool!

🎁 **RIVAL REWARDS**

Simply hook up your Steam, Origin or other gaming service and start earning straight away. Playing your favourite games will reward you with Rival Points which can be spent on rewards such as $RIVAL tokens, profile cosmetics, NFTs, gaming gear, and much more!

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **RIVAL PLAYER HUB**

Squad up, find and chat with friends, or form a dream team to compete in the Rival Arena. With a searchable player directory, you can find users who play your favorite games, at your skill level, in the positions you need to make climbing the ranked ladder a breeze. Need a third for Saturday's Rocket League tournament? The player hub has got you covered, a few clicks and you’ll be partnered with someone who is a perfect fit for your squad. It also has a built-in VOIP and chat program so that you can communicate with your teammates once you’re in-game. You can also squad up or play solo to climb Bit Rivals’ global and game-specific leaderboards. Showcase your skills, compare your stats, and earn bragging rights by climbing to the top!

📦 **RIVAL LOOT**

This is the official Bit Rivals marketplace, where players can purchase hardware, like keyboards and graphics cards, branded merch, and digital cosmetics using either $RIVAL or Rival Points. If you’re more artistic, you can even mint your own NFTs or design your own digital cosmetics for the platform to sell them in the store and earn a commission.

🔄 **RIVAL SWAP**

A built-in DEX tool that allows you to stake, swap, and farm $RIVAL. Since the developers have plans to make $RIVAL a cross-chain platform and token, you’ll be able to exchange BSC $RIVAL for pegged $RIVAL tokens on other platforms, including Ethereum, Matic and Cardano.

TL;DR, Bit Rivals is the ultimate gaming platform. You can play in casual or competitive tournaments or become a perennial host and earn organization fees as your next side-hustle. Earn rewards for just playing your favorite games and use them to get physical or digital merch. Find your dream team and squad up with players at your skill level that fit your style. All without ever leaving the Bit Rivals website or the future Bit Rivals desktop app.

💰 **TOKENOMICS**

$RIVAL is a none-deflationary token built on the Binance Smart Chain. There is a 1% tax when you buy or sell $RIVAL outside the Rival Swap and when $RIVAL is spent on the platform. All of that 1% tax goes to the Rival Reserve wallet, which funds official tournaments and Rivals Rewards.The total supply of $RIVAL is 1,000,000,000 tokens.

Based on the development team’s litepaper their initial allocation looks something like this:

\- 40% to Staking and LP Rewards

\- 25% to Presale

\- 10% to Initial LP

\- 7% to Rival Reserve

\- 6% to Team Allocations

\- 5% to Marketing

\- 4% to Development

\- 3% to Investors

They’re currently undergoing their CertiK audit, which you can find here, and will be holding a private presale on January 21st. You can get a spot on the whitelist by entering in their 800 spot giveaway on Gleam or enter the competition in their telegram, which you can find here!

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,"💎A Collection of 5,678 ♻️ unique generative CNFTs of whacky characters will be released onto the Cardano Blockchain.🔥"," **✅**  Remember all those socks you lost and can't for the life of you figure out where they went?

Maybe you abandoned them in a lone, dark, cold box somewhere in your basement...

Well they have come back to life and have taken the personalities of their last owners!

Woken from their long slumber the lone socks were petrified to find themselves shoved in close quarters

missing their better half, but these socks were not going to give up that easy!

They said ""Sock it!"" and decided to make the best of a bad situation!

Together they are called the Laughing Sock Collective, why you ask?

Because they are on a mission to find their sole-mates and are determined to have the last laugh.

* Every attribute will have varied rarities but here's the twist...
* Each sock will come with a 'Sole' Mate metadata field! This field will hold the identity of the perfect partner!
* The objective is to unite the two lone socks meant to be with each other in one wallet.
* This will add a unique value to each CNFT, irrespective of the rarity!
* United Socks can then take part in the ""Knotting Event""!
* Pssst - 80% of the collection will have 'Sole'Mates, while the rest will be forever alone....or will they?

💎 We would never put out a roadmap like the one you see above!  
We want this collection to be driven by the community. We have a good idea as to where we would like to take this collection, but would not want to be tied down by a hard roadmap. We want to make this a fun and enjoyable experience for our community as well as ourselves.  
So let us tell you how we would like the project to broadly progress and then The Collective decides what it wants to do!

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,Cardstarter - An insured launch pad for Cardano projects,"Hey guys,

I may have found a low cap gem here.  

Cardstarter is a launch pad for Cardano projects that provides some insurance to their their user base.  

Holders of their tokens that qualify for their tiers get access and guaranteed allocation to the presales future cardano projects that launch through their platform.  They just launched their socials today and they're getting a good amount of traction. They have a small raise though, and they mentioned initial circulating supply will only be 275k.  

I'm thinking this thing will blast off when it hits exchanges because of the low cap and small cap per person in the sale rounds.  No seed round, just a private sale and public sale with low limits per person.  

Tokenomics are geared heavily to community and liquidity.  Given the ride cardano is on, and the projects that are planning on building on it, or transitioning there from eth, this looks like a good bet.  Might be the polkastarter of Cardano.",24,2021-03-20 00:41:01,26

The first and biggest Ethereum ETH reflection token and with the auto-claim feature.

Simply hold MINIETH tokens in your wallet and you'll earn ETH.

In addition, there is a massive lottery mechanism.

REWARD MECHANISM When you buy MiniETH tokens you will receive a tracker token as a receipt for a purchase. Every 3 hours, the contract read the ledger to see how much you’ve owned against other holders. The reward is calculated by multiplying that ratio by the amount of tax gathered in each round. 2% of every buy/sell is taken and redistributed to all holders in the form of METH.

AUTOMATIC PAYMENTS EVERY 3 HOURS you'll receive ETH every 3 hours, and won't have to claim it yourself. They're automatically sent to your wallet! As a result, the earlier you buy the tokens, the higher reward you will get a high reward (since you get more tokens with lower price)

SECURED BY DESIGN The devs won't be able to remove liquidity! Liquidity will be locked  to ensure the safety of MiniETH investors.

In fact, a large proportion of the first merchants to use it will be physical stores.

Imagine paying directly with crypto! You can nowshop online or in person, and spend your crypto gains without having to send them to the bank or use a “crypto credit card” that is actually just swapping your crypto for fiat. Crypto is about to fulfill its true purpose as the CASH of the internet!

Fcfpay allow you to buy flowers with BNB and order food with Cardano (or any other crypto)... just about any combination you can imagine, and all without requiring you to use a traditional offramp, such as a centralized exchange.

**That’s why their motto is “EMPOWERING CRYPTO”!**

$FCF was already listed on 4 exchanges over a period of just 4 weeks! LBANK, HOTBIT, COINSBIT AND LATOKEN… and there are more to come!

Every payment gateway transaction will also induce a buy back and BURN mechanism in FCF, thereby increasing the value of your FCF by reducing the overall supply!

$FCF rewards holders with BNB dividends based on trading volume (5% of each transaction goes to the dividend pool and is distributed proportionally) AND from a portion of transaction fees once

FCFpay is launched. Yes, you will earn dividends on every payment gateway transaction! This safeguards your investment from bear markets by establishing a second source of dividend revenue! Imagine receiving a portion of the $4 trillion-dollar e-commerce industry simply by holding FCF!

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,"Cardano Backed Play and Earn Platform BitSport , Launched BitPool - World’s First Web3 Based 8Ball Pool - Live | $BITP Private Sale Ongoing","BitSport is a blockchain-based platform that offers competitive eSports and gaming, rewarding players for playing their favorite games. 

The platform has launched the world's first AI-powered blockchain-based 8-ball pool game called BitPool, making it one of the most innovative gaming platforms available. BitPool uses the same gameplay mechanics as traditional 8-ball pool games, such as aiming, shooting, and potting balls, but with additional features made possible by the latest technologies. 

It is an HTML5-based game, which means it can be played on any device with a modern web browser, without the need for additional software or applications. BitPool AI (BAI) is programmed to analyze players' moves and respond with its own strategies, providing players with challenging opponents. Players can gradually increase the challenge as they improve their skills and earn various cryptocurrencies like $BITP, $USDT, $BUSD, $ADA, etc. 

BitPool also has a challenge mode, tournaments, a DAO governance system, and a marketplace for NFT in-game items, such as pool cues, avatar sticks, and rare balls, which players can buy, sell, or trade with other players. 

The flagship token of the platform is $BITP, which powers most of the BitPool ecosystem features, including access to exclusive in-game NFT items, serving as the primary reward token integrated in the SDK module for game developers, and the only token used for staking on 8-ball players during live events.

What's even better is that BitPool Beta is now live and players can start earning $BITP by playing some of the F2E (Free to Earn) games on the platform. This is a great opportunity for gamers to earn cryptocurrency while doing what they love.

If you're interested in supporting BitSport, they are currently running a private sale for their $BITP token. You can learn more about the project and the private sale on their website at https://ido.bitsport.gg

ADAPT will reward holders in a unique way, paying dividends in the CARDANO token providing the best combination of huge profits and appreciation.

Their tokenomics include a monthly increase of the Buying Fee tax regarding the ADA rewards. This means that holders will receive larger and larger awards as time goes by. To benefit from the CARDANO reward distribution, you just need hold at least 50.000 ADAPT tokens.

Our reward system is triggered by volume. Payouts to holders may not occur every hour if trading volume is low. When this is the case, the amount of rewarded CARDANO each holder will receive does not decrease. However, will accrue over a longer period of time until it is suitable for a payout to trigger.

ADA reflections will increase 0.5% every month. Buying fee will increase by 0.5% every month until the total fee on buys hits 20% 

Sell fees will always stay at 15% 

So in October the Buying Fee will be 15.5% (Increased by 0.5%)  

 ⁃ 9.5% Cardano Reflections 

 ⁃ 3% Marketing Wallet 

 ⁃ 3% Liquidity Pool 

In November the buying fee will be 16% (Increased another 0.5%) 

 ⁃ 10% Cardano Reflections 

 ⁃ 3% Marketing Wallet 

 ⁃ 3% Liquidity Pool

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,🚀CardaLordz to Mount the First Spirituality-based 💎NFTs on the Cardano Blockchain Platform,"🚀Cardalordz is the game changing NFT, non-fungible token, everyone has been waiting for. Time and time again, new NFTs drop to ride the get rich quick wave. However, the Cardalordz team believes that riding trends in the short term for a quick profit is unethical, and ultimately leaves the token minter with money and the holder with a worthless image. Much like the Lords minted in our tokens, we aim to leave behind legacy that will live on in the hearts of humanity for generations to come.

💢 Avid investors have been jumping into cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens lately, as these two blockchain-based investment instruments have become the modern equivalent of a gold rush. As these new developments have taken over, companies like [CardaLordz](https://www.dailyadvent.com/tag/cardalordz) have been on the rise. World renowned [NFT](https://www.dailyadvent.com/tag/nft) artist [CirclePurple](https://www.dailyadvent.com/tag/circlepurple) who is leading the NFT. 

That is not to say that this project’s goal is not to create monetary value. Rather, we understand the economic principles of Adam Smith and the invisible hand. Supply and demand will dictate the price. If an NFT has value and creates demand, the results will speak for themselves.

🔥**WE WANT LONG TERM GROWTH**

Cardalordz is focused on long term growth, not only short term. We are looking forward years down the road to determine the best practices to take. Community growth, media outreach, and expanded use cases will always outperform. We will be sharing our NFT minting process with you all soon.

🔥**HOW WILL WE ACHIEVE IT?**

As part of a long-term strategy, we understand the value in community. Community is why the Lordz we are presenting in our project are here today. Community, much like money, is a form of social capital.

🔥**AN ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE**

We want to create an enjoyable experience you look forward to waking up for each day. To create a sense of purpose in the holder of our tokens. Community evolvement should never feel like a chore or work. This is a game, and we are here to have fun. Leave the boring stuff to us.

**💎**From our analysis, this seems to be the most important variable in creating value for the end user. We will be constantly working for both long- and short-term community growth goals across multiple social media outlets.**💎**Using gamification, community involvement will hardly feel like a chore. And on top the enjoyment you receive for participating, we will also be providing additional awards for community leaders.

#  🎁 Public Relations

Our team will also be very active in growing the community. For starters, we will be promoting the project at a variety of cryptocurrency related events. Two of our developers will be speaking at the Del Ray Beach Crypto Currency Conference on 9/23/2021. Our creative team will be releasing frequent press releases to keep everyone informed and excited about our project.

#  🎁 Education

CardaLordz sees a need to help educate people on the basics of NFTS. On Google's trending search analytics, the results are overwhelmingly questions on what NFTs are, how to purchase and sell them, and even basic questions of where to find them. By creating a basic educational page, we can both help to educate the community and lead people to discover our project.

   

#  🎁 Recap

Cardalordz is set for a game changing release by October 31 2021. By shifting the focus from a short term cash grab on minting images to a long term value driven model that grows based on supply and demand, Cardalordz will experience long and sustainable growth.

💢 **HOW TO JOIN THE MOVEMENT**

Come join the game changing NFT Cardalordz on Discord and learn how you can get involved in growing the community. We would love to answer your questions and hear your feedback for what you value and are looking for from our project.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,Why are top SafeMoon & SHIB holders buying into $PYE? BNB rewards from DEX transaction volume and mass marketing coming up before to push mass adoption….cardano bridge in development,"This cycle has blessed the crypto world with tokenomics. Projects like SafeMoon and SHIB have popped up gaining massive traction.  There is however a problem with such projects... and the problem has nothing to do with them…

It is the swaps 🤦‍♂️

When you buy a token on PCS or UniSwap the tokenomic taxes are taken AFTER the BNB is swapped to the token. This means that if the tokenomics have a function other than reflecting tokens (liquidity, buybacks, etc) it has to sell these tokens on the market. This negatively impacts the price and liquidity.

With PYESwap the taxes are taken in BNB BEFORE it buys the tokens. This allows for tokenomics without red candles interrupting momentum, straight up BNB reflections and way more! 

PYE’s innovative technologies and frictionless utility are making waves in the crypto-sphere. Our goal is to lower the barrier of entry, paving the way for cryptocurrencies mass adoption. PYECharts, PYESwap, and our NFT marketplace will seamlessly integrate with other platforms built by the well renowned DevTeamSix. A portion of the fees will then be redistributed back to PYE holders, and this is why many of the multimillionaire whales of SafeMoon & SHIB are invested into the next big eco-system in return of passive income in BNB. 

The development team behind this project and others have decades of experience in mass marketing businesses outside of crypto, and many videos of the offices are available over Twitter. https://devteamsix.com/our-team 

DevTeamSix are the visionaries behind this cryptocurrency movement. Their relentless drive and collective talent have been the foundations for PYE's many successes. To date PYE has: 

🔥Raised over $1M for charities, active partnership with Action Against Hunger 

🔥Fully intergrated with Shopify, Magento, OpenCart, WooCommerce and their 500,000 plus stores in 175 countries to have the ability to accept PYE as a form of payment. 

🔥Listed on CMC, CG, Probit, BitMart and whiteBIT just to name a few

🔥Gained Over 22,000 Holders organically minimum marketing used until the release of PYESWAP

dexIRA provides fully automated multi-currency dividend rewards, advanced buyback protocols and tokenomics that promote long term holding and wealth generation.

 You are searching for a token with a very low market cap? Check this sleeping giant.

💎 An Individual Retirement Account designed specifically for Decentralized Exchanges.

💎 dexIRA is the first token with multi-currency rewards, advanced buyback protocols and

💎 Tokenomics that promote long term hodling and wealth generation.

🚀 Rewards holders in BNB, BTC, ETH, LINK, DOT, DOGE, SAFEMOON, ADA, BUSD, SAFEMOON and MORE! 🎊

The platform is based on the synergy of two concepts: DEX (decentralized exchanges) and IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts). Borrowing from the long-term investment idea behind a traditional IRA, dexIRA investors can grow their holdings commission-free similar to tax-free IRA contributions. This allows members to increase their stake in the reward pool over time without sacrificing initial capital.

After a one-year holding period, investors can sell their $DEX holdings tax-free and penalty-free. However, similar to the age restrictions on a traditional IRA, if holders choose to sell early, they're penalized.

Investors are protected even when $DEX tokens are sold and the price drops because they are rewarded with two thirds of all fees collected. Similarly, the dexIRA contract includes enhanced token buyback protocols to spur growth and anti-whale measures to prevent large one-off sell orders.

**Key features of dexIRA**

✅ Get 20% rewards

✅ Auto-claimed Multi-Currency Reflections

✅ Friendly Wale Buyback & Burn

✅ Automatic Liquidity Pool

✅ Anti Whale Dumps

✅ Burned LP

✅ No Tax on Buy Orders

✅ No mint token

✅ Sell tax removed after 1yr hodling

✅ Funds Are Safu

**Whats so special? And why is it mooning?**

The strategy is simple: Incentivize new investment by waiving fees when purchasing dexIRA tokens. Support long-term growth by providing rewards and penalizing speculative short-term traders.

dexIRA was created to shift the mindset of investors and prove that cryptocurrencies can be stable, value-appreciating assets if the tokenomics support a long-term investment goal

Buy $DEX tokens without fees, use them to automatically collect and manage a diverse array of curated tokens in the following cryptocurrencies: BNB, BUSD, BTCB, ETH, DOGE, CAKE, XRP, LITE, LINK, DOT, ADA. SAFEMOON, ATOM, MATIC, TETHER, 1INCH, BUNNY.

💵 Earn a passive income | Receive your share of 12% Cardano ADA rewards for holding 💵

***What is ADACatalyst?***

ADACatalyst Token (ADAC) is a yield-generating contract, offering Cardano ADA rewards on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). By simply holding ADAC, you will receive rewards distributed in ADA, rather than token reflections. The contract employs a static reward system, enabling holders to earn a passive income via reflections from each transaction.

***Tokenomics***

💸 **12% Cardano ADA Rewards to Holders**

Dividends will be automatically distributed to holders every 60 minutes (depending on trading volume). 12% of every transaction cost is used to reward holders with Cardano ADA. The larger your ADAC holding, the greater your share of the 12% reward.

Note: A minimum holding of 200m tokens is required to qualify for rewards.

📸 **3% for the Marketing Wallet**

3% of the transaction charge is automatically added to the Marketing Wallet. These funds will be utilized for running marketing campaigns on Social Media, implement strategies to keep our audience engaged, realize referral programs to incentivise word of mouth, facilitate airdrop tokens and to fund a host of other promotional activities that will ensure the sustainable growth of the token.

📈 **3% for the Liquidity Pool**

3% of the transaction charge is automatically added to the Liquidity Pool.  
Liquidity is the lifeline of the crypto market. It reduces investment risk and most importantly, defines your exit strategy. All investors and traders prefer liquid markets. Healthy liquidity assures a smooth, speedy and convenient trading experience.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,A Revolutionary New Crosschain CARDANO and BSC IDO. PumpLaunch Is The Only IDO That Won't Require You To Hold Thousands Of Dollars Worth Of Its Native Token!,"# Bringing to you the CARDANO and BSC IDO Revolution, PumpLaunch, as seen on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pumplaunch-making-idos-accessible-everyone-140000071.html?guccounter=1) and [Business Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/pumplaunch-making-idos-accessible-to-everyone-1030500171)! 

\--

It's not just about gains, it's about the future. When Sean and his development team viewed the current IDO platforms, he noticed a problem. They all wanted you to purchase a hefty amount of tokens in order to have even the opportunity to create something. Why? Because these platforms didn't share the vision of the future, where everything and everyone has a token to call their own, true financial freedom and the truly free market.

Do you know who believes that is the future, who envisions it as such? **CZ himself**, right out of his mouth. If he knew what this team was doing, that they were sharing this revolutionary idea that would make his vision into a reality, he would be shilling this himself. [$PUMP'](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x5610bf2bf5abe5750bdbce311631dee2afa2cd24)s IDO known as PumpLaunch, is trying to create a platform for **EVERYONE**.

Most of the people who bought in the presale held their allocations and are eager to see this project develop. This morning when I woke up, I was pleasantly surprised to see people who used to spread FUD about this project to finally convert and become avid $PUMP supporters.

Besides the chance to claim allocations, no matter the amount of [$PUMP](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x5610bf2bf5abe5750bdbce311631dee2afa2cd24) you hold, you also get a chance to participate in the weekly tech giveaways. For every week that you hold [$PUMP](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x5610bf2bf5abe5750bdbce311631dee2afa2cd24), you get a chance win win things such as:

* Phones
* Gaming Computers
* Graphics Cards
* And Many More!

With PumpLaunch with its native token [$PUMP](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x5610bf2bf5abe5750bdbce311631dee2afa2cd24), you will always be a winner, as long as you HODL.

# What's all the hype about?

We are celebrating the long awaited launch of the smart contracts on Cardano's network. This is a huge milestone for all the investors of Cardano and people who have waited to build on the mainnet. This is why we want to get a head start on making sure our investors are ahead of the game.

&#x200B;

**Redistribution will have you prepared for the ADA's network with PartyADA.**

* 1. BSC + ERC (multi-chain launch)
* Portion of taxes are saved for deflationary token liquidity on ADA mainnet when it launches. Holders are airdropped the main ADA PRADA token.

&#x200B;

* 2. Active Calculations
* As we launch on ADA mainnet, we will be bridging over and airdropping all holders of PRADA (BSC/ERC) proportional to their holdings of the new PRADA (ADA).

&#x200B;

* 3. Upon migration, one of the first tokens on ADA mainnet with stable liquidity and list of solid holders. Utility of the PRADA token after migration would be to facilitate builders with capital, marketing, and investors to help incubate projects from very talented builders.

&#x200B;

* 4. This means more airdrops, chances to speculate on early projects, and a strong tight knit community that believes in Cardano’s solution for smart contract scaling.",978,2021-09-14 09:41:57,318

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,ADAPT aims to be the fastest-growing cryptocurrency of its kind! ADA rewards!Dont miss out 🔥 Huge Potential 🚀,"Launched very recently, ADAPT aims to be the fastest-growing cryptocurrency of its kind. ADAPT will reward holders in a unique way, paying dividends in the CARDANO token providing the best combination of huge profits and appreciation.

Their tokenomics include a monthly increase of the Buying Fee tax regarding the ADA rewards. This means that holders will receive larger and larger awards as time goes by. To benefit from the CARDANO reward distribution, you just need hold at least 50.000 ADAPT tokens.

Our reward system is triggered by volume. Payouts to holders may not occur every hour if trading volume is low. When this is the case, the amount of rewarded CARDANO each holder will receive does not decrease. However, will accrue over a longer period of time until it is suitable for a payout to trigger.

ShibaElonVerse (SHIBEV) is the next token that will revolutionize the Metaverse.

&#x200B;

The project is based on the holding: While investors hold, they will receive Cardano (ADA), one of the most valuable currencies in the crypto market.

&#x200B;

While investors hold, the currency will serve to develop an ecosystem within the metaverse, where the token will buy a plot and develop its activity there, in which all users can participate.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,📌Rewards Cardano - Just Launched ✅ Voice Chat Daily - Dev Doxxed Video voice chat every day🦎 Active Telegram Group ⭐️ Great Potential - Next x1000 Gem | 8% Rewards ADA,"


Tired of getting honeypotted or rugged? Well, so are we. The main reason we came together and formed the Rewards Cardano team is that we’ve lost tons of our money to scammers and wanted to do it right for the community. The community spoke and we listened! No more of that whitelist contest trash, only to end up getting dumped on by presalers. Let’s be real - those hard caps are way too high anyway.

📃Whitelist Applications – NONE OF THAT

🛎Presale: NOPE

🚀Launch: Fair

The rewards coin community has proven to be the most vibrant and robust community in the entire crypto space this altcoin season. Whether it’s because of Elon or our hope for quick gains, we’re here for you. Iconic meme coins that have made thousands of people millionaires, they all started as a joke. However, the Rewards Cardano team on the other hand, are very serious about this project and committed to making it a tremendous success for everyone; all the while getting their holders great gains. Rewards Cardano aims to be a simplistic growth and rewards token built on some of the most sophisticated technology in the entire crypto space – the Binance Smart Chain. We know that BSC tokens have been getting a bad rap recently with the amount of scams and want to be as transparent with our community as possible. We’re here to answer all of your questions.

What if you could speculate on crypto’s trends and earn rewards in the hottest altcoin right now?

Meet Rewards Cardano, the coin that also pays handsomely to its holders in another currency. This is a brand-new project, launching very very soon — and gaining traction every day, spreading mostly by word of mouth. We haven’t even taken the plastic off. The team is tight-lipped and plans on saving most of the marketing for after launch. The old “wen marketing” meme seems fitting here.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,DogeHouse Capital 🐕 | Official Website & Swap/DTF dApp Launch! 🏦 | $ADA Dividends & Rewards 💰| Cardano Bridge Coming Soon! 🌉LEGIT MOONSHOT.,"Invest Confidently on the Binance Smart Chain, Cardano Blockchain, and Beyond!

DogeHouse Capital is the only cryptocurrency project bringing professional digital asset management to meme-based digital currencies on the Binance Smart Chain, Cardano Blockchain, and beyond. At DogeHouse, we believe in investing in puppies with a purpose - not pump and dump ""shitcoins"".

DogeHouse Capital is not dependent on our BSC-based native token ($ DOGEX) to succeed. We will launch our native token on PancakeSwap (PCS) in/around mid September, but our project is much more than a typical BSC token.

DogeHouse Capital will also provide our members with an opportunity to purchase wrapped tokens modeled after Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) containing the world's top cryptocurrencies in a single token! That's a first in DeFi! More on this below...

Staking Platform (dApp): https://www.dogehousecapital.com/staking 🥩
Swap/DTF: Coming Soon! 📈
Cardano Bridge: Coming Soon! 🌉
Practical Utility at Launch

At launch, DogeHouse Capital will offer our investors a full suite of dApps including a staking platform and proprietary swap. Check out our thoughts on staking on Medium!

Furthermore, as mentioned above, we will also provide our users with an opportunity to trade the only professionally managed Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in DeFi called the Doge Traded Fund (DTF).

For years, Wall Street has tried to set-up an ETF for cryptocurrency, but the rigid regulatory nature governing our traditional financial markets has not allowed it to happen. In DeFi, no such regulations exist and tokenized versions that mirror traditional ETFs on Wall Street can be wrapped and traded via our one and only proprietary dApp!

For a limited number of investors, DogeHouse Capital will also offer an exclusive fund managed by us with a focus on the Cardano, Polkadot, and Kusama blockchain(s) and their associated infrastructure for steady annualized returns. Check out our philosophy on digital asset management on Medium!

Medium: https://medium.com/@dogehousecapital
Looking Ahead

There are a lot of ""Cardano Rewards"" projects hitting the ""shitcoin"" market these days, but few of them have any appreciation and/or conceptional understanding of why Cardano will revolutionize the industry.

At DogeHouse Capital, we are focused on investing in the future of DeFi - not the past. For this reason, we will focus on the development of our bridge to the Cardano Blockchain following our successful launch on PCS in/around mid-September 2021.

This course of action will provide our members with a practical utility that will enable them to transfer their $ADA pegged to $BNB rewards into the Cardano Native Token (CNT) in anticipation of the coming shift to the Cardano Blockchain.

We have big plans for the future and we want you to be a part of them. Consider investing with us today and pay us a visit!",982,2021-09-04 10:54:47,81

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,$TeslADA launch 🚀 at 6PM UTC 12/09 ADA Rewards. ready for Cardano Smart Contracts Today! ✔️,"TeslADA: Electrifying the BSC with 9% ADA Rewards and a Charged Up Team [Launching Today; 90k MC at launch]

I think I have found a real gem that is launching TODAY 6pm UTC on Sept 12th.

TeslADA features: ⚡️ 9% ADA Rewards. ⚡️ The best whitepaper I have read for a BSC project. ⚡️ A really friendly team that come across as honest and professional. ⚡️ A TG group that is full of actual people and not bots (shocking!). ⚡️ LP locked through Dx Sale

There was a presale through Dx Sale yesterday that reached its 120 BNB hard cap very quickly. It featured a small max 1 BNB contribution per person, and a soft whitelist to screen out snipers and bots from participating.

By now, everyone reading this has already been in several rewards tokens. I think the key to a successful one is a competent team that has the marketing nous to continue pushing awareness of the token after launch, which keeps transaction volume strong the weeks and months following launch.

How many times have we heard vague promises of “huge marketing plans” on launch day in a rewards token only for it to never eventuate? I would wager the reason marketing plans never eventuate is that most devs are out to take profit from investors over a couple of days following launch, disappear, and then start working on the next token. We’ve seen this so many times in the BSC over and over.

I really am confident that TeslADA has the vision and experience for success in this space, and with 30k of BNB in the marketing wallet on launch day it can really fly. They have lined up big marketing for launch day that will only snowball further into launch week.

For those interested in checking them out, below are some links to the website and whitepaper. Also, come and say hello in the official Telegram, you’ll also find communities in English, Chinese, Vietnamese, Brazilian Portuguese, and more languages to come!

&#x200B;

🚀 Launchpad  

Launchpad is live!! Come check it out: [https://milkshiba.com/milkpad/#](https://milkshiba.com/milkpad/#) 

MilkShiba's Milkpad is the first presale platform launching on the Milkomeda blockchain. ONLY presale platform truly focused on benefitting the governance token by using staking tiers, presale burn rounds and automatic buy back and burn for 50% of platform profits

&#x200B;

🍴 Titano Fork & DAO 

\* High Titano auto-staking APY

\* Win 1-3% of all the taxes in $ADA thru Milk Combat - if you become the Milk Shib (biggest buy) for 24 hours you join the DAO and govern the ecosystem!

&#x200B;

 Listed 

We also just got listed on Coingecko. Only three so far on the chain, ADA, a DEX and MilkShiba.

&#x200B;

🥛 Highlights 

\* Super slick TG bot has been ready and working since LAUNCH, tracking buys, competitions, etc.

\* NFT artist is officially commissioned and artwork can be seen on twitter and in TG

\* 1st edition MilkShibas, around 500 NFTs to mint

&#x200B;

🥛 Details 

If you're reading this for the first time you can find all of our information including roadmap, whitepaper, github, staking information on our website, and view all of the APY and milk war stats on the dashboard. If you need help bridging we have guides on our website and will help you out in telegram!

&#x200B;

When our full ecosystem is live, presale fees from the launchpad go to benefit MSHIB holders. Additionally WRAPPED MSHIB will be created to give holders additional benefits.

&#x200B;

View the DAO, the APY all in the dashboard. If you beat the current MSHIB you win 3% of all the taxes for 30 minutes, and 1% of the taxes for 24 hours in ADA. If you hold this position for 24 hours you become the fourth DAO member.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,🐍AnadonDA Token ($nakes) 🐍 ADA Rewards Long Term Investment Here!!!,"


Quick Token Summary & Vision: 

This project is meant to appeal to the more traditional investor. Many projects out there are designed to boom and fall and make many rich and many poor. Reward based projects are great because you are paid in a currency outside of the project’s main token. This project allows people, when they need to take profit, sell the reward token and not the project currency, affecting its value. The price of the coin is less important than overall trading volume, as you are rewarded on volume. This means buys AND sells reward holders with more ADA rewards tokens. 

ADA is a unique reward as you can also stake it in the CARDANO network. The best way to profit from this project is to take the ADA rewards and then stake them in their own network. You will be earning passive income two ways. Our core community is a solid one. It comprises of people who have all met in this crazy world of crypto and we wanted to make a great reward project that all of us could enjoy and not feel bad about liquidating since we can now do it by selling our rewards and not our tokens. 

💎TOKENOMICS:

▫️TOTAL TRANSACTION TAX: 10%

▪️Liquidity: 3%

▪️Reflection to holders: 5.0% in ADA

▪️Community Wallet for Mining Operations & Marketing: 2% 

▫️SET SLIPPAGE TO: 12%

BABYFROG $BFROG is a double dividend yield paying token on the BSC. Inspired by the BNB and ADA communities, the dev team who are long time crypto investors aim to provide the $BABYFROG community with the best of both tokens, a fun atmosphere and lots of $BNB and $ADA for everyone to share!

All holders of BABYFROG (regardless of the amount of tokens held) will receive $BNB and $ADA in equal amounts of value (15%-5%) automatically airdropped into their wallets.

$BFROG is a reflective, LP acquisitioning and Buy Back Token. Which means that every transaction will distribute tokens to the holders, it will also liquidate assets meaning it will provide and grow the liquidity pool and burns tokens automatically. We have also set up Buy Back protocols. All of which redistribute with every transaction. Every action taken is with our community in mind.

Our Tokenomics are designed for the future. The anti-bot and anti-dump features will provide our HOLDERS stability in a safe, and 100% rug proof, environment. We also know that marketing and liquidity play an important role in the growth of the token. So our fees will make sure that this part is taken care of with every transaction. BabyFrog Has a very low Buy-In fee and a time delay has been implemented on both buys and sells to prevent chart manipulation by bots. To prevent Big Dumps you can only sell with a maximum price impact of 0,3%.

DogeHouse Capital is the only cryptocurrency project bringing professional digital asset management to meme-based digital currencies on the Binance Smart Chain, Cardano Blockchain, and beyond. At DogeHouse, we believe in investing in puppies with a purpose - not pump and dump ""shitcoins"".

DogeHouse Capital is not dependent on our BSC-based native token ($ DOGEX) to succeed. We will launch our native token on PancakeSwap (PCS) in/around mid September, but our project is much more than a typical BSC token.

DogeHouse Capital will also provide our members with an opportunity to purchase wrapped tokens modeled after Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) containing the world's top cryptocurrencies in a single token! That's a first in DeFi! More on this below...

Cardano Bridge: Coming Soon! 🌉

Practical Utility at Launch

At launch, DogeHouse Capital will offer our investors a full suite of dApps including a staking platform and proprietary swap. Check out our thoughts on staking on Medium!

Furthermore, as mentioned above, we will also provide our users with an opportunity to trade the only professionally managed Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in DeFi called the Doge Traded Fund (DTF).

For years, Wall Street has tried to set-up an ETF for cryptocurrency, but the rigid regulatory nature governing our traditional financial markets has not allowed it to happen. In DeFi, no such regulations exist and tokenized versions that mirror traditional ETFs on Wall Street can be wrapped and traded via our one and only proprietary dApp!

For a limited number of investors, DogeHouse Capital will also offer an exclusive fund managed by us with a focus on the Cardano, Polkadot, and Kusama blockchain(s) and their associated infrastructure for steady annualized returns. Check out our philosophy on digital asset management on Medium!

Medium: https://medium.com/@dogehousecapital Looking Ahead

There are a lot of ""Cardano Rewards"" projects hitting the ""shitcoin"" market these days, but few of them have any appreciation and/or conceptional understanding of why Cardano will revolutionize the industry.

At DogeHouse Capital, we are focused on investing in the future of DeFi - not the past. For this reason, we will focus on the development of our bridge to the Cardano Blockchain following our successful launch on PCS in/around mid-September 2021.

This course of action will provide our members with a practical utility that will enable them to transfer their $ADA pegged to $BNB rewards into the Cardano Native Token (CNT) in anticipation of the coming shift to the Cardano Blockchain.

We have big plans for the future and we want you to be a part of them. Consider investing with us today and pay us a visit!!!",1008,2021-09-02 14:29:30,43

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,"🐔Kentucky Fried Cardano🐔 Fried? Cardano? Are you serious! Yes, Yes sir I am! An awesome combination – KFC and Cardano all combined into one package! Grab a bucket of KFC and earn some $ADA. Doxxed known devs and DOXXED 🐶DOG 🐶! – What you are waiting for??"," The dev here even doxxed his dog! The market is a little bit crazy but despite that this is serious. An opportunity to earn $ADA rewards while holding one of the most ultimate names that could possible be memed. Colonel Sanders handing out $ADA to holders. Who doesn’t want a piece of that!

The community sure does – this is growing like wildfire. There is some really sensational volume right now. The developers remain active and continue marketing. Tweets continue to fly in as do pinned messages. The community is super hyped and they continue to promote the project.

The shilling competitions do not stop and nor does the paid marketing. The community is really positive which is probably the most important thing in a token. The market is unpredictable and there are no guarantees. What is important is to have a safe place to play. 

The chart is continually moving in the right direction with constant sideways and also upwards momentum. I am not an expert in charting but it feels like it’s finding a strong floor at a $20k marketcap which is impressive for a coin that launched with a 3BNB liquidity pool.

There are no guarantees of anything. But maybe jump in and check this out. Over 6% of the tokens have been burned. The rewards are all coming through and with the manual claim you can stack your rewards without draining the contract of gas fees that reward people who earn 10 cents of rewards.

With a dedicated community, devs that are active and doxxed and a doxxed dog (that’s still making me LMAO 😂) This looks like a nice safe and enjoyable play. My only feedback is they don’t have a DJ. Nothing better than shilling and chilling while you listen to tunes.

I’m in the chat as well – so come in and say hi! Let’s see if this is one of those OG type moonshots from the earlier days!

What is Cardano?
Cardano is a blockchain platform for changemakers, innovators, and visionaries, with the tools and technologies required to create possibility for the many, as well as the few, and bring about positive global change.

Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform: the first to be founded on peer-reviewed research and developed through evidence-based methods. It combines pioneering technologies to provide unparalleled security and sustainability to decentralized applications, systems, and societies.

With a leading team of engineers, Cardano exists to redistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins – to individuals – and be an enabling force for positive change and progress.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,DogeHouse Capital 🐕 | Official Website & Staking dApp Launch 🥩 | Practical Utility w/$ADA Dividends 🛠 | Oversubscribed Whitelist! 👀,"**Invest Confidently on the Binance Smart Chain, Cardano Blockchain, and Beyond!**

DogeHouse Capital is the only cryptocurrency project bringing professional digital asset management to meme-based digital currencies on the Binance Smart Chain, Cardano Blockchain, and beyond. At DogeHouse, we believe in investing in puppies with a purpose - not pump and dump ""shitcoins"".

DogeHouse Capital is not dependent on our BSC-based native token ($ DOGEX) to succeed. We will launch our native token on PancakeSwap (PCS) in/around mid September, but our project is much more than a typical BSC token.

DogeHouse Capital will also provide our members with an opportunity to purchase wrapped tokens modeled after Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) containing the world's top cryptocurrencies in a single token! That's a first in DeFi! More on this below...

\- [https://t.me/DogeHouseCapital](https://t.me/DogeHouseCapital)

\- Staking Platform (dApp): [https://www.dogehousecapital.com/staking](https://www.dogehousecapital.com/staking) 🥩

\- Swap/DTF: Coming Soon! 📈

\- Cardano Bridge: Coming Soon! 🌉

Practical Utility at Launch

At launch, DogeHouse Capital will offer our investors a full suite of dApps including a staking platform and proprietary swap. Check out our thoughts on staking on Medium!

Furthermore, as mentioned above, we will also provide our users with an opportunity to trade the only professionally managed Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in DeFi called the Doge Traded Fund (DTF).

For years, Wall Street has tried to set-up an ETF for cryptocurrency, but the rigid regulatory nature governing our traditional financial markets has not allowed it to happen. In DeFi, no such regulations exist and tokenized versions that mirror traditional ETFs on Wall Street can be wrapped and traded via our one and only proprietary dApp!

For a limited number of investors, DogeHouse Capital will also offer an exclusive fund managed by us with a focus on the Cardano, Polkadot, and Kusama blockchain(s) and their associated infrastructure for steady annualized returns. Check out our philosophy on digital asset management on Medium!

\- Medium: [https://medium.com/@dogehousecapital](https://medium.com/@dogehousecapital)

Looking Ahead

There are a lot of ""Cardano Rewards"" projects hitting the ""shitcoin"" market these days, but few of them have any appreciation and/or conceptional understanding of why Cardano will revolutionize the industry.

At DogeHouse Capital, we are focused on investing in the future of DeFi - not the past. For this reason, we will focus on the development of our bridge to the Cardano Blockchain following our successful launch on PCS in/around mid-September 2021.

This course of action will provide our members with a practical utility that will enable them to transfer their $ADA pegged to $BNB rewards into the Cardano Native Token (CNT) in anticipation of the coming shift to the Cardano Blockchain.

We have big plans for the future and we want you to be a part of them. Consider investing with us today and pay us a visit!",852,2021-08-29 21:04:16,43

The communities of Dogecoin and Cardano have proven to be some of the most vibrant and robust communities in the entire crypto space this year. However, their stories couldn’t be more different. Doge, the now iconic meme coin that has made thousands of people millionaires, started as a joke. Cardano, on the other hand, is a research-based blockchain that is expected to unveil some of the most sophisticated technology in the entire crypto space.
What if you could speculate on crypto’s most beloved meme while earning rewards in ADA, the native token of crypto’s most highly anticipated blockchain project of 2021?
Meet Doge Cardano, the meme coin that allows its holders to earn $ADA automatically on an hourly basis. No need to claim manually, Cardano is now automatically streamed to your wallet every hour!
Doge Cardano is a brand new project launching on July 23rd — and gaining traction every day.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,King Cardano (KADA)👑 All hail the king as it hits $1 million MC | first day it launches on CMC | 9% reflection in ADA + 3% buy and burn,"King Cardano is the king of tokens. This is the first auto-claim ADA token with the highest paying yields of up to 9%. Simply hold KADA tokens and get rewarded in ADA on every transaction.

***There’s NO waiting or need to claim your rewards. It happens instantly and automatically.***

The longer you hold KADA tokens, the more you earn in rewards and the closer you are to becoming the King. Why settle for 7-8% rewards or waiting around for your rewards when we can reward holders instantly with 9% from every BUY & SELL transaction!

Additionally, we the King Cardano protocol leads to a rise in price on EVERY transaction. 3% of each transaction gets bought back in the open market and burned forever, therefore increasing the value on everyone’s coins

&#x200B;

* *-Largest reflection token in ADA right now! 9% reflection*
* *-3% of every transaction is bought in the open market and then burned. Both those actions lead to an increase in value of the token and reduce the supply on each transaction. This token will continue to rise*
* *-3% for marketing and dev*
* *-$1M marketcap the first day it hits CMC with plenty of room to move*
* *-Supply matches Cardano. The goal is to peg it against ADA long term.* 
* *-Applied to all major listings and waiting. Still has chance to moon many more times.*
* *-Massive marketing campaigns with active ads running on reddit and poocoin*

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,ADAflect launching on August 28th on BSC - Hold ADAflect and receive ADA payments directly to your wallet! - Audit by Paladin Security - $50k starting Liquidity and Anti-Bot Scripts,"On August 28th at 20:00 UTC ADAflect is launching on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The premise is simple: you hold ADAflect and receive ADA payments every 60 minutes. That's possible thanks to the cheap fees on the Binance Smart Chain network! They stated that one of the reasons why they went with Binance Smart Chain is so that everyone can buy in and get a chance to receive dividends in ADA.

The team will provide a starting Liquidity of $50.000 and have Anti-Bot protection scripts running, so there is a good chance to make some x's.

It's a long term project with long term support from the team behind it. They have already put up a website which I'll link below. To further provide security, their contract is currently in audit by Paladin Security.

It's a fair launch, so there'll be no team tokens and no pre-sale, everyone gets the same fair chance to participate and earn some nice ADA dividends.

&#x200B;

**Please see below for a summary of the token:**

\-$50k starting Liquidity, Anti-Bot scripts

\-Hold ADAflect, receive ADA directly to your wallet every 60 minutes

\-Liquidity Lock upon launch

What is $ThunderADA?

ThunderADA is the next evolution of a reflection token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC): the innovative double reward reflection token using the power of 80/20 to maximize your earnings for both now & future.

Simply hold $THUNDERADA tokens and get rewarded 20% in ADA and 5% in THOREUM, a long-term x100 token, from every buy & sell, automatically delivered to your wallet every 60 minutes.

Why should I invest in $ThunderADA?

ThunderADA has an innovative double reward reflection system using the power of 80/20 that rewarding holders in 2 tokens: 80% invest for now and mid term, and 20% invest for long term holding, to maximize your earnings both for now and future.

✅ADA - 80% for now and mid-term: is now about $2.5 but expected to be $5 at the end of this year and potential to $12.5 (x5) in mid-term as ADA is the native token of the Cardano platform which is a rival of Ethereum with much better technological advantage.

8% of transaction tax in ADA make sure that ThunderADA holders benefit immediately from the big rewards coming from every transaction, and this can be equal to 40% when ADA price x5 in the near future.

ADA Price Hit All-Time High at $2.7243 on 20 Aug, Overtakes Binance Coin as Third-Most Valuable Crypto 🏆

As the network develops, ADA could break out to reach & surpass the level of Ethereum.

Marketcap is now $81B, x5 potential by the end of this year!

✅ THOREUM - 20% for long-term future : Thoreum is expected to be the next Safemoon 2.0 with many innovative features that is the first in the crypto world, such as Thor Thunder to buy back & burn with 4,700+ BNB fund & increasing \~100 BNB everyday, or Thunder Boost to earn staking rewards while still getting reflection rewards, etc. With a hyper deflationary nature, Thoreum price is expected to x100 in this year and next.

5% of transaction tax (2% from buy & 3% from sell) for a token like Thoreum is like a long-term investment and it can be equal to 500% in the long-term future.

✅ Unique Dual Dividends with Double Rewards

Holding ThunderADA means that you will receive ADA and Thoreum for FREE every 60 minutes.

Holding THOREUM means you will receive more THOREUM reflection automatically to your wallet FOREVER!

✅Thunder Alliance - the Auto Rewards Ecosystem

ThunderADA is an important part of Thunder Alliance, an Auto Rewards Ecosystem. The system currently consist of:

Thoreum (Coinmarketcap, CoinGecko listed, Certik Audit);

ThunderCake (Coinmarketcap listed);

ThunderBNB (Coingecko listed);

ThunderADA (in presale) ;

and is open for other auto reward tokens to join.

Thunder Alliance Ecosystem has many different auto rewarding tokens that support each other to increase value in the long term.

The best way to make use of this Ecosystem is to hold every token in it. Any growth of a token will bring up others, and a token cannot fall too low since other tokens will support it because each user buy & sell of one token will have transfer tax to buy and burn other tokens. The system is designed to strengthen every token's position in the long run and this is a strategic advantage when a token does not have to fight alone in the market.

So, holding a basket of tokens in the system is the best strategy to not be affected by each up and down of the market and see your basket grow day by day, week by week and month by month together with Thunder Alliance - the Auto Rewards Ecosystem.",1040,2021-08-22 13:13:05,21

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,PartyADA $PRADA BSC ⏰ Launched 1 hour ago! ⏰ Celebrate Cardano's Smart Contracts | Leading up to one of the biggest token launches planned for Cardano,"Get Rewarded 🎁 ADA tokens on BSC by holding PARTYADA $PRADA

Celebrating 🎉 ADA Smart Contract Launch

Incubating 🐣 the first deflationary token on the Cardano Network.

Redistributed ADA tokens on BSC in preparation for the ADA launch for all investors in different blockchains. 🚀

# ⏰ Launched 1 hour ago! ⏰

**Tokenomics:**

* Redistribution: 2%
* LP Pool: 1%
* Marketing/Liquidity for ADA token launch: 6%

💬 **Official Telegram:** [https://t.me/PartyADA](https://t.me/PartyADA)

🌎 **Website:** [https://www.partyada.io/](https://www.partyada.io/)

# What's all the hype about?

We are celebrating the long awaited launch of the smart contracts on Cardano's network. This is a huge milestone for all the investors of Cardano and people who have waited to build on the mainnet. This is why we want to get a head start on making sure our investors are ahead of the game.

&#x200B;

**Redistribution will have you prepared for the ADA's network with PartyADA.**

&#x200B;

1. BSC + ERC (multi-chain launch)

* Portion of taxes are saved for deflationary token liquidity on ADA mainnet when it launches. Holders are airdropped the main ADA PRADA token.

&#x200B;

* 2. Active Calculations
* As we launch on ADA mainnet, we will be bridging over and airdropping all holders of PRADA (BSC/ERC) proportional to their holdings of the new PRADA (ADA).

&#x200B;

* 3. Upon migration, one of the first tokens on ADA mainnet with stable liquidity and list of solid holders. Utility of the PRADA token after migration would be to facilitate builders with capital, marketing, and investors to help incubate projects from very talented builders.

&#x200B;

* 4. This means more airdrops, chances to speculate on early projects, and a strong tight knit community that believes in Cardano’s solution for smart contract scaling.",979,2021-09-14 21:38:23,22

What is $BabyCanADA?

We are a new BSC token that rewards all holdings in plentiful ADA deposits! Every holder gets 9% of ADA right back to their wallet!

Why Canada You Ask: Canada has a well-deserved reputation for being one of the friendliest places on earth. Not only that but it’s also considered to be one of the safest places to live. If you’re looking for the benefits of moving or immigrating to Canada, you won’t have to look very far.

With ADA catching up to the ATH and the BTC dominance increasing, having a source for passively earning ADA will provide safu backup while trading in low-cap altcoins. This mechanism will not only reward holders but also help hedge against BTC dominance in the cryptocurrency markets.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,🔹 XOADA | Intelligent Marketing | Ada Returns | Just Stealth Launched | Doxxed DEV!,"***XOADA : An ADA Reflection Token***

XOADA offers very simple and safe tokenomics, 7% in ADA, 4% towards marketing, and 3% towards to liquidity.

XOADA’s marketing strategy is it’s transparency, it’s fairness, and it’s simplicity. Lead by a professional team of developers, XOADA is a high-tech rewards token, matching the current standard, and bringing forth a new look. By taking advantage of the current bull run that ADA is currently going through, XOADA, is aimed to capitalize on that through intelligent marketing.

XOADA also challenges the current issue with whales, by implementing a max transaction rate set at 2% of the total supply, and a max wallet size of 4% ensuring that everyone has a fair share of XOADA.

XOADA does not want to rug pull, so XOADA has locked liquidity, and a contract that is safe. 

Just hold XOADA, and earn ADA while your token goes up as others join in on the reward hype.

*XOADA is the future.*

*XOADA is the present.*

XOADA is now live on the blockchain.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,AtomicADA is one of the best choices you'll make today | Get your ADA rewards | Developer and team are very active helping their community non-stop | Well organized project |,"Atomic ADA is meant to appeal to the more traditional investor. Many projects out there are designed to boom and fall and make many rich and many poor. Reward based projects are great because you are paid in a currency outside of the project’s main token. This project allows people, when they need to take profit, sell the reward token and not the project currency, affecting its value. The price of the coin is less important than overall trading volume, as you are rewarded on volume. This means buys AND sells reward holders with more ADA rewards tokens. At a marketcap of 100k we will change to 12% ADA rewards and lower the tax for liquidity and marketing.

&#x200B;

ADA is a unique reward as you can also stake it in the CARDANO network. The best way to profit from this project is to take the ADA rewards and then stake them in their own network. You will be earning passive income two ways. Our core community is a solid one. It comprises of people who have all met in this crazy world of crypto and we wanted to make a great reward project that all of us could enjoy and not feel bad about liquidating since we can now do it by selling our rewards and not our tokens.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,ADA APES Fairlaunch | BSC Gem | Low MC | Based Dev | Solid Team,"

🚀🚀🚀ADA APES Fairlaunch 🚀🚀🚀

Tired of getting honeypotted or rugged? Well, so are we. The main reason we came together and formed the ADA APES team is that we’ve lost tons of our money to scammers and wanted to do it right for the community. The community spoke and we listened! No more of that whitelist contest trash, only to end up getting dumped on by presalers. Let’s be real - those hard caps are way too high anyway.

📃Whitelist Applications – NONE OF THAT

🛎Presale: NOPE

🚀Launch: Fair

The rewards coin community has proven to be the most vibrant and robust community in the entire crypto space this altcoin season. Whether it’s because of Elon or our hope for quick gains, we’re here for you. Iconic meme coins that have made thousands of people millionaires, they all started as a joke. However, the ADA APES team on the other hand, are very serious about this project and committed to making it a tremendous success for everyone; all the while getting their holders great gains. ADA APES aims to be a simplistic growth and rewards token built on some of the most sophisticated technology in the entire crypto space – the Binance Smart Chain. We know that BSC tokens have been getting a bad rap recently with the amount of scams and want to be as transparent with our community as possible. We’re here to answer all of your questions.

What if you could speculate on crypto’s trends and earn rewards in the hottest altcoin right now?

Meet ADA APES, the coin that also pays handsomely to its holders in another currency. This is a brand-new project, launching very very soon — and gaining traction every day, spreading mostly by word of mouth. We haven’t even taken the plastic off. The team is tight-lipped and plans on saving most of the marketing for after launch. The old “wen marketing” meme seems fitting here.

📃To get into the presale or on the whitelist - please find some other project. We don’t do that stuff around here, ser.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,EarnADA | The next gen future of passive yield tokenomics today,"Let me introduce you to a sleeper gem I found out about recently which is laying in stealth, EarnADA. It's a next generational token handwritten by a very based dev to earn you ADA just by holding. Reflection based tokenomics are so 2020, getting your rewards as ADA pays and boy does it ever like a well oiled machine. 

Best of all, unlike other tokens with passive income mechanics it doesn't have silly requirements for you having to lock down your tokens or claim daily. With EarnADA you claim however frequently or infrequently you want, you just pay bsc gas to claim them.

And that's not the end of EarnADA's unique features, there's two big ones to protect you the buyer. EarnADA features anti-whale protections to limit token capacity to 2.5 million per holder and features anti-dumping mechanics to limit selling to 250K every 30 minutes. That said, why would you want to sell when you make so much passive income just from holding, and the more and more volume of trades the more ADA we all get.

The website just launched and the dAPP is shortly to come, marketing is just about to begin as well. There's over 50BNB in marketing funds set aside for ads, influencers, all the good stuff and with AMAs and the like planned. The dev team is ready to take this to the moon and beyond.

There might come clones but there is only one original, EarnADA.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,$DADA - Daddy Doge ADA | Automatic rewards for holders in ADA," 

Check out this newly launched coin, $DADA - seems to be a completely fair and stealth launch, with no presale or whitelist wallets. Being a stealth launch, the contract address wasn’t shared until release, preventing bots from ruining the launch.

To add, the starting liquidity seems to be very low = it will have very high potential of profiting early investors, whilst also having a max wallet hold so that no botter can hold the supply hostage. The community owns 90% of the tokens, and LP is already locked, 100% SAFU.

The staff team consisting of the different moderators, admins and developers seem to be connected to a wide range of crypto twitter influencers. They also seem to be very active and competent in moderating the chat.

Lastly, in my eyes all the green flags have been checked. Active, transparent and competent team members, graphics are completely unique and custom to the project, website is clean and very informational (contains a lot of information and FAQs about the contract). They also have a dAPP which you can check the rewards you have gained by holding their coin $DADA in the website. The potential gains of this project are massive, and I think it absolutely outweighs the risks. Also final note, look at the chart for entry points as this was a fairlaunch, a lot of people will exit for profits early. Don’t buy the top and always wait for an entry! DYOR

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What makes our Reward token different than others?

Almost all reward tokens skim rewards for deployer or marketing wallets.

ADACatto deployer or marketing wallets is exclude from any rewards. This means all REWARDS go to Investors and Holders!

&#x200B;

🔑 Safety Measures of ADACatto SC:

&#x200B;

 ➡️ The contract has the option to change the ADA Reward fee, but also a security mechanism that it can’t be set lower than 7%.

➡️ The marketing fee can’t be set higher than 7%.

➡️ The liquidity fee can’t be set higher than 12%.

➡️ The contract has a MaxSellTransactionAmount function. To avoid any malicious activity, it can’t be set lower than 100m ADACatto

➡️ Marketing is exempt from Rewards but will be able to sell without any fees.

➡️ NO mint function!

&#x200B;

ADACATTO IS SAFU ✅

WHAT IS $PADA?

$PADA is the newest reward token with incorporated anti dump features. Since there’s great hype around Cardano right now we’ve decided to make the hottest ADA reward token to make sure that every $PADA holder has a nice bag of ADA to profit from the pumps!  Simply hold $PADA and reach for the stars!

HOW IT WORKS

Buy and Hold $PADA and you will automatically receive ADA in your wallet every hour. No need to farm, stake or claim.

The project was just launched, so this is your chance to be early for the next moonshot. There is a sweepstake whitelist competition to avoid a botted presale.

Whitelist link: [https://sweepwidget.com/view/26868-16ufobtx](https://sweepwidget.com/view/26868-16ufobtx)

We are also holding a small private presale currently which is 15% cheaper than the public presale price to raise funds for marketing and project related expenses.

Moondano will be your next Moonshot and by massively increasing in value and rewarding you with pegged ADA tokens this is an absolute no brainer to get into.

We are planning to airdrop holders of our token actual ADA tokens once ADA smart contracts are introduced.

We plan to launch our own DEX platform and token just like Pancakeswap on BSC.

We spend many hours in our bakery adding, testing and creating new delicious tokens that you will love. They are also always healthy for your wallet since you will not have to worry about those calories.

CHOCONOMICS

**How the contract works**

When a sell occurs, you will see multiple transactions on Poocoin chart: one goes to the seller, second one goes for 8% ADA rewards, another one goes to liquidity pool (2%) and last (4%) to marketing so we can bring influencers/ads and work on the coin’s development.

**8% Redistribution in ADA**

8% of each purchase/sale is distributed among all holders. The rewards will be distributed in $ADA, currently one of the most trending cryptocurrencies!

Auto Paid Every 30 minutes

The rewards autosystem is activated every 30 minutes, your ADA will automatically reach your wallet. If the volume is low, the transaction will be done when there is enough accumulation to do so to avoid gas fees!

Anti-Rug System — Secured with Locked Liquidity

Initial Liquidity provided is locked and will be extended as we develop as a community. The KitADA team developed a contract that is safe for everyone and rewarding the long-term holders.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,👶LittleBabyWhale🐳 Launching 24/08 18:00 utc in 1 hour! ADA Rewards 12% Auto-ADA Rewards to holders 💰 | Twitter contest live ✅,"LittleBabyWhale proposes an innovative feature in its contract : DIVIDEND YIELD PAID IN ADA! With the auto-claim feature, simply hold $LTBW and you'll receive ADA automatically in your wallet. Hold $LTBW and get rewards in ADA on every transaction!

LittleBabyWhale also challenges the current issue with whales, by implementing a max transaction rate set at 2% of the total supply, and a max wallet size of 3% ensuring that everyone has a fair share of $LTBW.

AUTO Rewards every 60 minutes! For the first time ever, you don’t need to claim your earned ADA. It’s automatically sent to your wallet every 60 minutes.

Just hold $LTBW, and earn ADA while your token goes up as others join in on the reward hype.

12% of every buy/sell is taken and redistributed to all holders. Hold $LTBW tokens, earn ADA.

3% of every transaction is transformed into liquidity for Pancakeswap. It's automatic and helps create a price floor (stability).

2% of every transaction is allocated to Marketing in ADA (swapped to ADA in real time to avoid dumps). So we can fuel the most ambitious projects and reward our active community.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,$ADABoy Highest ADA Rewards at 10% | Over $160K USD in ADA claimed l Chart is bullish,"
Cardano (ADA) is currently mooning and crossed $2 for the first time in months. Currently it's trading at $2.16 as we speak.

ADABoy holders are raving about the ADA rewards they are getting even with just around 30k-50k volume. Some are getting around $50 worth of ADA per day just for holding around 1% of the ADABoy supply.

Currently, there's an experiment being done by ADABoy's partners where they will compare staking 2000 ADA (worth $4000) on Kraken and just holding 20M ADABoy worth around $50. Results will be shared soon so stay tuned for that. It should be HUGE!

🔝Highest ADA Rewards (10%)

ADABoy currently has the highest ADA rewards in the market at 10% 💪🏼. With 50k volume, 1% holding (or around 1B ADAboy) can get you $50 a day or $1500 a month! What kind of passive income can give you that? 👀

✅ Over $160K USD Rewards claimed

Yes you heard that right! In just over 2 weeks, ADABoy has given out over 85K ADA or around $168K USD at only 280K market cap! 

💯 SAFU

With 1 audit already done with RugFreeCoins (zero issues found), and another one coming up, your investments are safe with ADABoy! Of course please do your own research still and NFA.

📊 Chart is Bullish

ADABoy's Chart is looking bullish and dips are being eaten. Regardless of the price action though, hodlers are rewarded as every buy/sell just means more ADA rewards.

Phew that was a lot! But wait, there's more:

 1. Shilling Competition (Over 50M Tokens prizes)

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,$EarnAda ~EADA is the first Token with which you can earn ADA passively! Do not miss out on this gem💎,"EarnADA - Next Generation passive yield Token

Passive Income token like MRAT, HODL and Ghostface etc. are gaining much attention lately.

But they all come with some caveat. You need to claim at a specific time, otherwise your rewards are lost.

EarnADA solves that by autostaking your tokens, so you can claim at any time.

EarnADA also comes with other unique features like: Whale Protection: no wallet can hold more than 2.5% of the initial supply Dump Protection: No wallet can sell more than 0.5% of the initial supply, sellers get locked for 30 minutes.

There is a 15% tax on each transaction 6% Ada reflection 6% Auto LP that get autolocked into the contract. 3% Burn

Ada can be claimed either on BSCscan or by sending less than 1 EADA to any address(set gas limit higher if it fails)

LP are locked into the contract.

This is a experimental token, dyor.

When 1 b1MT hits 1$  we will airdrop  10000$ on discord, yes everyone will be able to grab a share of it.

What can you do with b1MT? It can be used as a utility token to pay for advertising services and can be traded on decentralized and centralized exchanges.

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,"ADANOMICS - A one of a kind rebase contract, hold and receive ADA","We all know that BSC is a fast moving space and rebase and “nomics” coins are the hottest trends on the market. With that, let us introduce you to ADANOMICS - the next 100x moonshot!

Tokenomics – 
🔐3% Liquidity 
💧5% ADA Rewards 
📈5% Marketing wallet & BuyBack 
👨‍💻2% Dev wallet

Why rebase? What is it and how does it work?

If you bought 100 tokens, each for 1$. You paid 100$ and got 100$ worth. After the rebase, the supply is cut in half (just as an example). Everything else being equal, you have now 50 tokens but each is worth 2$. So you still have 100$, but split among 50 tokens instead of 100$. This creates a bullish chart and a fomo effect. Some people see the token number decrease and panic, thinking it's a rug or something, while in fact it's the rebase taking effect.

Launch date TBC, private and public presale taking place very soon. 🔥

Private Presale:
50 BNB

Public Presale :
50 BNB

Huge marketing plans:
✅ CMC listing (fast track after launch)
✅ Poocoin ads
✅ Coinsniper, Coinhunt, Coinvote
✅ Famous twitter influencers and telegram call channels

ADA,CryptoMoonShots,🚀 GHD Token & APP Launching this Tuesday 6:00PM UTC ! First crypto APP ever + Doxxed Dev! 💎,"„We are launching our own GHD APP for the first time ever in crypto history where you’ll be able to purchase your sporting event tickets such as , Football, Basketball, Cricket, Tennis, UFC using crypto! Using BNB, BTC, ETH, ADA and many more! You’ll be able to get up to 20% discount when you purchase the tickets using GHD Token! The APP will be launched before the presale and you’ll be able to purchase sporting tickets and use our features by 27th of July.
Note: 15% of the tickets sales profits goes to the token liquidity.“

Here’s some information about the GHD Token presale.

Presale is on 👇🏼
Tuesday 22nd of June 6:00PM UTC

They are hosting their presale on Dxsale.
Soft cap is 750BNB.
Hard cap is 1000BNB.
Minimum purchase is 0.2BNB
Maximum purchase is 2BNB
Liquidity is locked for 100 years.

The official launch will be on Tuesday 22nd of June 6:30PM UTC after the presale on pancakeswap.

GHD token burns 10% of the “Supply” on each token transfer buy/sell, this has never been done before since crypto devs usually add this tax to be added to liquidity/holders. The burning of the tokens actually over time keeps drastically increasing the price of the coin, example from €0.0001, 0’s will keep on being eliminated till a value of $0.01-$1 is reached which is very much possible with this new method.

Tokonomics are:
35% Presale 
30% Liquidity (Locked for a 100 Year)
10% Burn
10% Marketing
10% Airdrop
5% Team wallet (Locked for a Year)

ADA Token,"We’re coming closer to the next bull run and I believe we now have a huge opportunity in the Cardano Ecosystem.  
Contrary to the prior bear market, we now have smart contracts and some amazing projects already built and being used on Cardano.  
I believe these Early-Stage projects, even though risky can have an incredible potential for the next bull market, as long as we are able to select the ones that seem to have the most potential.  
That is exactly what I try to do in this video, where I create a list of the top 5 projects with the highest potential on the Cardano Ecosystem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af9ZnlRKkd0  
These are projects from different areas, with different narratives, and all projects that have already something to show and have had a decent impact either in the Cardano Ecosystem or in the real world.   
All the projects have tokens, even though the tokenomics are very different and some have better tokenomics than others.   
What are the projects you believe are missing here and that have incredible potential? And most importantly why do you think they have potential?",9,2023-12-11 20:21:47,2

While talking about the challenge of future competitor, they mentionned VerusCoin a <50mln marketcap cryptocurrency alongside with Polkadot, Cardano, Solana ... which are all >9Bln marketcap L0/L1 blockchain.

Date of first mined block : 21 mai 2018. (4 years old of building under the radar).

Project will be presented at Consensus2022 In Autin Texas 9-12 June 2022.

I already invested in it during last pump 2 months ago so i'm biased. Don't just listen to me, go look at what is being build but just wanted to make it available to you before it's to late. I hope some devs/tester will join the network and help this project build a strong/smart community.

I myself help like I can but i'm not technilogically knowledgeable enough to help developping. Only testing. So you're welcome if you want to help build/test a genuine brand new paradigm in the blockchain industry.

If you have any question, you can join the discord, the community will be happy to answer you. (you can find the link on the website in the menu ""Community>Contribute"".

I'll also be happy to answer easier question right here if you have some. Thanks for reading (if you did).",2,2022-05-19 10:49:24,24

ADA,Altcoin,Top 2 Alts In Your Portfolio Right Now?,I'm just curious.... What are your top 2 altcoins in your portfolio right now? Mine: [**Cardano**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/) **and** [**VeChain**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/vechain/),30,2021-05-31 22:15:23,96
ADA,Altcoin,10 Altcoin Crypto Projects that will make you a millionaire,"It seems to be so many people these days investing in meme coins for fun or projects that they don't understand. We are still very early in the space and recognizing that is important. The following cryptos below I've researched thoroughly and it is my assertion that with sufficient investment these cryptos will make you a millionaire these are great quality projects with invaluable utility and solid fundamentals for the future. The title is a little clickbaitish forgive me and none of this is financial advise. I posted this as an article on mirror as well (first decentralized writing platform for writers) so if you'd like to throw a tip the link will be below

1. Ultra (UOS): They are currently partnered with AMD and Ubisoft among elrond, Sandbox, Cudos etc. This one has gone under the radar for a while this was my second investment in the crypto space and I invested in it in February. This is a game distribution platform similar to steam. Ultra takes 15% revenue share as opposed to most game distribution platforms which take 30%. This will mobilize developers to in turn lets say advertise their game to be downloaded on Ultra vs steam etc. A prominent thing that makes Ultra special and is sort of an underlying but major component is that it's not just a platform for games but an entire ecosystem for which any dapps (i.e Sandbox, Twitch, Discord) can be implemented (theta is already in the client). They have a universal SDK meaning games in the commonly coded language on xbox, playstation and pc can be ported into it. NFTs in gaming will give ownership to the players, the game you buy is an NFT and be resold after a duration set by the creator. Imagine an exclusive game being sold with like 20000 copies or 100 unique NFT swords being added every season within the game. the possibilities are endless. The co-founder David Hanson has bragged several times on how there will be MILLIONS of gamers playing on Ultra next year. This is the best gaming/metaverse crypto project. Their interviews/podcast show me they have a great sense of knowledge of the gaming space, are well connected within the gaming industry which is evidenced by partnerships as well underlying tidbits in telegram and have thought thoroughly about a flowing economy of use cases with NFTs within games along with the platform. Now finally with Steam banning blockchain/NFT involved games and Ubisoft putting NFTs in one of their major titles (Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Breakpoint) it is showing a dedication to the space which is also evidenced by this quote from Baptiste Chardon who is a blockchain business and product director at Strategic Innovation Lab at Ubisoft “This is not a one-time project. It’s part of our global Ubisoft strategy to try and test new stuff.” I am as optimistic as ever for the potential of this project.

2. Lukso (LYXE): Lukso is a blockchain basically for the new digital lifestyle. Digital clothing aka fashion, universal identity across blockchains, and tokenization of assets are some of the things they are focusing on. Fabian Vogelstellar is the founder and was a cofounder of the Ethereum foundation, one of his most prominent accomplishments was proposing the ERC 20 standard among many other things. He founded Lukso with his Marjorie Hernandez who runs her own fashion site taking an angle at the new digital fashion ecosystem. NFTs/Fashion and Universal Profiles (authentication across blockchains) are the main things they are going for here but there's a whole lot more. They have advisors on board from nike to Chanel to Instagram. They also have a close connection with the RTFKT brand which was recently acquired by Nike, metaverse fashion will be huge and they will be one of the pillars occupying it.

3. DTravel (TRVL): They are a DAO so think of a decentralized air bnb. Their team is top tier consisting of the person who wrote Cardano’s whitepaper all the way to booking.com cofounder and former airbnb executives. They are backed by Travala an already successful crypto flights project. I really like the sense of earnesty in their interviews which allows me to ride this journey out with them.

4. UTU (UTU): Trust infrastructure for the internet. reviews and ratings are often manipulated they aim to essentially be the standard of the entire internet to ensure authenticity.There is definitely going to be a demand for this as it’s simply just an issue that is allowed to be seriously abused when it comes to book reviews on amazon or political podcasts, the use cases could also be extended to housekeepers, dating, doctors, financial services and micro-lending. there are just ever prevalent scenarios where a sense of trust will be essential for business. They are backed by Animoca brands (Sandbox, Axie Infinity) Elrond Travala etc. and have an already working product in South Africa implementing this in connection with a taxi service.

5. Cudos (CUDOS): Partnered with AMD, Ultra, Elrond etc. they are basically going to make use of phones and computers to allow you to mine other coins. Some things to note with this project is that Jörg Roskowetz who is AMD’s Head of blockchain is affiliated with this project (along with Ultra). He was quoted as saying ""Distributed cloud compute and tokenization will become a standard.”. Ultra gives me confidence to bet on them and their team is pretty seasoner within the tech industry as well.

6. Propy (PRO): NFTs within the real estate industry. Their founder is very active in Miami networking, hosting webinars with thousands of real estate agents and showing up at real estate events. Kevin O’Leary from Shark Tank recently answered a question at a real estate event from Propy’s CRO Joe Budelli which was “Do you believe we would have mass adoption of folks purchasing real estate as an NFT as well as other physical properties that represented by a title that can be digitized?” his reply was “We could save a lot of money and paperwork because it would all be on a smart contract. Real estate is probably the best use case for this. Also would be very good for taxes would solve a-lot of problems in terms of how you tax real estate as well and how you can pay your taxes on it and adjust tax rates. It’s coming for sure to real estate”.

7. GET Protocol (GET): NFTs, collectibles and tickets at concerts. They are already servicing several ticket providers. They have some good tech here and it looks very solid.

8. dotmoovs (MOOV):  Play to earn blockchain sports NFT game. They have great artificial intelligence tech it’s a very fun mobile app compete with others around the world. They have Futball ambassadors Ricardo Quaresma and Luis Figo. They have backing by the likes of moonrock capital etc. This is an app that can easily garner a community and potentially go viral with the right execution of marketing and developments within the project.

9. Syntropy (NOIA): They basically have a grand plan to change the entire current internet framework security, privacy, performance just next generation connectivity basically. They have a well seasoned team deep in the technology industry and have advisors onboard ranging from former AT&T, Verizon and even Microsoft executives. They are also partnered with Elrond. I must admit I don’t often have much of a technological understanding of some things but the vision expressed through what I heard makes resounding sense and if they pull it off the internet will just be a better place as a whole.

10. Bridge Mutual Insurance(BMI): This is pretty self explanatory not much to say about it. You can basically provide and get coverage  over smart contracts, stable coins and exchanges. I don’t know when we will see the need or demand for this but it eventually will be needed.

These are a few up and coming projects that I believe in and will be investing in as well

$TDVR token,This is a decentralized music VR platform coming up in 2022. Authentic party experience with photorealistic 3D venues, DJs, artists and clubs. They will utilize Oculus (best VR headset on the market today) and they're located in Berlin which is one of the most popular club scenes in the world. Founders are seasoned throughout prior history in the music industry, VR, tech(Fabian is also onboard :)) etc.

$SAVG token first decentralized video and photo NFT marketplace users get 98% of profits, Rights Management Licensing in metadata of the NFTS and carbon neutral. similar to shutterstock. Will be coming out some time in January 2022

$DEHR Decentralized linked in basically, ""Users can Connect, Earn, Exchange Data as a daily basic through career activities"". They just recently had their IDO December 15 I believe.

Honorable mentions

Elrond: This will be big one day just a huge ecosystem well connected with so many projects making great developments in the space. Will eventually reinvest back in given the opportunity.

Sandbox: Just a titan currently in the space and their parent company is well invested throughout the metaverse scene this would be a solid hold as any.

Hyprr: I hold a bit of this its a social media platform looks really smooth, some good early NFT artists on it, I like the branding some negative discourse in their telegram but seem to be moving in a good direction.

Last but not least a few blockchain games that are actually shaping up to be some good quality games with good intentions behind them.BigTime and Blankos Block Party. I’ll cover them another time hopefully.

Just one more thing I love SomniumSpace its a social open vr platform and from attending some concerts of actual DJs running it like real life, singers singing beautifully, rappers rapping in open syphers, people dancing as well as conversating and an actual woman pole dancing in real life (which translates to inside VR) the community is just beautiful. This was such a great experience and I recommend you guys try and attend a concert/get involved as well. I believe they have a token called $CUBE I haven’t had much time to look at it but I will almost surely be investing in this given the chance as well. (I love the faceless avatars NFT collection as well. I just had to mention it haha haven’t been able to even buy one yet my focus is on becoming rich first (or if I manage to catch a really good deal) then I can support good quality work and ideas like this project :P.

I acquired all these coins by purchasing ETH on Coinbase then sending it to my ERC-20 wallet which was Coinbase Wallet using the browser function to go to uniswap.org and swapping ETH for the alt coins. Always make sure that it has a verified checkmark from coingecko.com or coinmarketcap.com and that the token address matches on both uniswap and coingecko/coinmarketcap. Kucoin is another good exchange to use along with Binance, Crypto.com and Kraken being an option as well.

If you enjoyed this article and I enlightened you on some things then I’m just glad I could point you in a good direction of long term projects to just invest into and enjoy the blooming of the flowers when the sun rises. Thanks and have a great day!",19,2021-12-18 13:10:05,78

ADA,Altcoin,Why Sell?,"Why would anyone sell? Bitcoin now costs the same as it did the day after Thanksgiving. Ethereum costs the same as it did on Jan 2. Neo is currently twice as much as it was Dec 21. Monero is at 233 and it never broke 200 until this past December. Cardano is now right where it was in mid December. It's too bad people are glued to their hourly account balance and missing out on the big picture. Emotionally distraught people are selling. Financially wise people are buying. This summer, there is going to be alot of bitter folks that wish they never logged into their accounts on Feb 1 2018. Countries around the world are not banning crypto. They are simply cleaning things up and gearing up for full blown legal crypto. Sure, there will be new rules but crypto is here to stay. If tomorrow marked the final day of cryptocurrency history, I could understand the panic and the selling. However, do you think the Canadian gov't would be using Ethereum for record keeping if crypto was in trouble? Would IBM be partnering with Stellar if crypto was doomed? Would Microsoft be sponsoring NEO dev competitions if crypto was ending? Would Samsung be pouring big money into building and selling cryptocurrency mining chips if Crypto was truly in trouble? Politicians are pumping the breaks until they figure out how to cash in. They did they same thing with daily fantasy sports, online poker, gambling, and cannabis. In 2015, Daily Fantasy Sports was legal in 45 states. In 2016, it was legal in only 10 states because politicians wanted to shut it down until they figured out how to make money off it for themselves. Today, DFS is legal in 41 states. That's right, from an unregulated 45 (2015), cracked down to 10 (2016), and now that politicians can make money off the regulated industry, it's legal in 41. Folks, crypto is going through the growing pains of becoming a full blown accepted industry. Check out online poker...

- 1995: The first online poker websites appear. Everyone made money except governments.

- 1999: Republican from Virginia, Robert Goodlatte, tried to shut it down with a new law. People panicked and cashed out. His law never passed. It was defeated.

- 2003: Thanks to pressure from the Justice Department, most banks blocked customers from sending money to poker sites

- 2005: The world's largest online poker site (PartyGaming) went live on the London Stock exchange the same year that a Republican from Iowa tried to ban credit card payments on gambling sites. His bill never reached the Senate floor.

- 2006: Goodlatte is back again. Tries to ban online poker/gambling. He is defeated again.

- 2006: President Bush signs the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, banning the transfer of money to gambling sites. Everyone cashes out.

- Today: New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware have legalized it. People in every state freely use offshore sites. Banks are no longer blocking payments.

Whether it's online poker, cannabis, daily fantasy sports, or cryptocurrency, the people vote with their wallets. Sure, governments always get involved so they can make a buck too (if it was about our safety, health, and well being then guns would be outlawed). Hold your coins if you haven't sold. Buy coins this weekend at a massive discount. Embrace the future. Expect dips along the way. We are riding a climate change graph that continually trends up. So what if there is a record cold winter here or there. The zig-zagging line is trending up from year to year. Hold and/or buy. You will have major profits should you choose to sell this summer, fall, or in 2019. Keep your eye on the prize, stay off reddit, stay away from ""news"", and trust your instincts when you realized months or years ago that this was an unstoppable revolution: the future.",213,2018-02-02 03:55:25,66
ADA,Altcoin,Transparency in private DeFi,"2022 has seen the strengthening of scalability and security of blockchains at the technology layer, such as the Ethereum merge and Cardano Vasil fork. Almost exactly oppositely, we saw centralized institutions like FTX, 3AC, and Celsius fail spectacularly leaving users and investors without remedy. 2022 was one of the worst years in crypto in both price drawdowns and startling breakdowns of trust. However, these collapses hold an important lesson: we are here to build systems that don’t need trust and cannot be affected by trust breakdown on a technological level. These systems need widespread adoption, not just from crypto nerds but from the normies, your mum, your dad, your barista, your banker, or your manager. For this to occur, we need privacy to be built into all systems because these groups would not be comfortable with their entire transaction history and balances being broadcast every time they buy something or get a loan.

Foremost, enabling information transparency is one of the biggest promises of blockchain technology, which provides a fully auditable and valid ledger of transactions. A blockchain is a transparent register in which anyone can join the network and, as a result, view all information on that network.

Transparency in crypto means that every action and transaction is publicly stored on the blockchain. It can be easily matched by public ledgers using explorers such as etherscan.io or blockchain.info until the end of time. It may be simple to ignore privacy as an individual when purchasing, sending, and transacting digital assets. However, because transaction patterns can be matched, anyone can track blockchain transactions on public blockchain ledgers using explorers such as blockchain.info and etherscan.io, which potentially puts you at risk. I would wish to pay for a service without revealing any transaction details that could expose me to theft, blackmail, or other nefarious actors.

Bitcoin and the blockchain paved the way for anonymity, control, and security within a largely insecure public infrastructure. However, there is still progress to be made to reach the full potential of anonymity and control in cryptocurrency at the moment. IMO, the future of cryptocurrency revolves around privacy, and while there are popular privacy tokens such as Monero and Zcash, the zero-knowledge proof technology has become extremely popular, with both Zk-SNARKs and Zk-STARKs frequently utilized to obfuscate and maintain anonymity currently. There are subjective views and sentiments about these technologies. These solutions are great for holding and privately transferring value, however, they lack DeFi functionality and you are exposed to the market price of ZEC and XMR. Not exactly ideal for the long-term management of finances.

Railgun is a smart contract privacy protocol that is deployed directly on Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon. From what I understand, it allows users to interact with smart contracts privately and is thus composable with dApps without needing any bridges (which is a security risk). I’ve had a play around with it and think it has the potential to bring privacy to DeFi which might be a bigger issue as more and more people adopt DeFi.

RAIL is the governance token for Railgun DAO and might as well be among the best-performing privacy-focused altcoins in 2023. One to watch!

ADA,Altcoin,Which Altcoins Have The Most Potential to Change The World?,"With so many altcoins out there, many with real value but for small cases (like specialized coins to pay social media influencers, for example), which altcoins have the potential to really change the world, and the way we do things?

I'm still pretty new at this, but at the top of my head I can just imagine IOTA (internet of things, no fees, fast), Cardano (aims to be next version of Etherium, very strong and smart team), and Ripple (we hate banks, but they're going to adapt, and most of us still need to use banks sometimes).

Which other ones do you guys think?",43,2017-12-30 09:49:17,92
ADA,Altcoin,Bitget has announced its new Launchpool event,"Nowadays it is probably hard to find new events providing bountiful earning opportunities for traders, users and newbies. Sometimes we look for events that provide plenteous benefits but eventually end up getting very tiny amounts of reward for participation. Bitget is offering its Launchpool event for one of its newly listed ZETA projects sharing a huge amount of approximately 336k USDT worth of rewards. However individual reward depends on the amount of BGB that has been staked by a single participant implying that it can vary from participant to participant. The amount of BGB can a single person stake is capped at 100k BGB which is almost impalpable. 

Regardless of BGB staked, prize pool ROI can fluctuate over time and is 0.88% at present seems dynamic as incredibly increased from 0.5% thus it's albeit inevitable to change. Henceforth we might expect ROI to go as higher as the amount of BGB continues to accrue meanwhile we can't ignore the potential of BGB as it keeps rising with it. More than 36 Million BGB was staked so far assuming steady growth in its price. As I can remember the price of the BGB gained significant changes since the launchpool announcement from 0.58 cents to 0.64 cents which ultimately amplified those portfolios endured holding since the beginning of this Launchpool. The more the amount of BGB will be staked more the price will be enlarged resulting in participants ending up getting decent ROI on their investments and ZETA as a staking reward which is lucrative from my perspective.

ADA,Altcoin,I built an app that ranks coins based on the growth of their communities (X-Post /r/CryptoCurrency),"Hi /r/altcoin, I wanted to share a personal project that I figured some of you guys might be interested in. I have noticed in the 9 months (the most meme and stress filled of my life) of closely following the crypto markets, that one of the biggest factors in determining the future success of a coin, coming after only its technology, is the community surrounding it (see /r/NEO). This isn't always the best thing because fundamentals and the technology sometimes get ignored but its a fact of the market right now.

&nbsp;

A community that can dispel all the FUD surrounding its coin, explain to the lay man the value and use case of the coin, or hype upcoming news without going overboard ( don’t see /r/NEO ;) ) is incredibly valuable to adding to the confidence of potential buyers. This is what inspired me to make [Coinmunity.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinmunity-bitcoin-altcoin-app/id1322869245?mt=8)

&nbsp;

Coinmunity is an app where you can easily stay on top of which coins are currently experiencing the most growth in their communities (reddit and twitter) and how it relates to their prices over time.  In crypto, where hype plays such a huge role in the price, buying the rumor and selling the news is super important (even tho its so damn hard to ignore the FOMO). Coinmunity aggregates all the top posts from each coin’s subreddit so you can keep track of which coins have big upcoming events and learn more about coins you may not have heard of before - all in one place. **You can download the iOS app [here!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinmunity-bitcoin-altcoin-app/id1322869245?mt=8)**

Syrius Zenon wallet introduction https://youtu.be/t6A7vKhp-MY

based anon explanation What is it: Incredibly fast, almost infinitely scalable state-of-the-art DLT. It combines the block-lattice architecture that was first(?) used by Raiblocks/Nano with a DAG that exists as a separate layer for the consensus. The block-lattice handles the transactions. It's going to be used to scale Web3 dapps as a L1, and also process transactions as a L2 chain.

Who does it: This is an independent, open-source project and will probably be run by a foundation similar to Ethereum and Cardano, but I'm about 99.5% sure its backed by Square. I can enumerate the zillions of times they have hinted as such if I really have to here, but you can search for old biz posts on Zenon here and also on Warosu.

Square will likely use it to scale Bitcoin transactions where the default payment for merchants and Cashapp users is made in BTC, and then they can set it to dollars or pounds or whatever afterwards.

Its open source and not owned by Square, like how Node.js isn't owned by Google but has wide adoption. They'll easily recruit 1000s of legacy web apps for this bc no code changes are needed, and also dapps on Ethereum will easily switch over.",50,2021-04-20 15:50:25,31

Its open source and not owned by Square, like how Node.js isn't owned by Google but has wide adoption. They'll easily recruit 1000s of legacy web apps for this bc no code changes are needed, and also dapps on Ethereum will easily switch over.",31,2021-05-03 16:32:36,29

ADA,Altcoin,CryptoQuestion - Weekly Staking and Yield Farming Review — 9th December 2021,"I've copied and pasted in CryptoQuestion Weekly Staking Review. Very interesting, take a look

CryptoQuestion - Weekly Staking and Yield Farming Review —  9th December 2021

The world of DeFi has been abuzz with talk about regulation recently.

Here is a quick overview of what has been happening and what implications this will have on investors.

The influential FATF (FinancialAction Task Force) **wants governments to hold the people behind DeFi protocols accountable**. This will send the shivers down the backs of the many platforms that have decided on anonymity. This proposal is not likely to come in for some time but it is something that we can see being implemented and ruthlessly enforced.

In another attack on the DeFi space. BlockFi, which offers high interest rates to investors, is being **investigated by the SEC**. The SEC considers that BlockFi’s interest accounts represent the offering of unregistered securities, something that no doubt the SEC will use to target many other high profile yield farming platforms in the near future.

eToro announced it was **delisting Cardano** by the end of the year for US customers as it believes the coin could represent security.

A few weeks ago we revealed the SEC’s inquiry into Uniswap. That alone has massive implications for the rest of the industry with the likes of Pancakeswap likely to be on the SEC’s radar.

The best action investors can do right now is avoid investing in DeFi projects which are conducting investment business within the US. These are likely to be targeted by regulators and that will have a significant impact on their tokens value.

As far as staking and yield farming is concerned investors would be wise to keep any bets to the short term avoiding any long term Certificate of Deposit type arrangements and other long term crypto investment plans.

This week’s APRs from leading staking and yield farming platforms [https://cryptoquestion.tech/staking-and-yield-farming-weekly-review/](https://cryptoquestion.tech/staking-and-yield-farming-weekly-review/)

This week saw a return to normality for Pancakeswap and Sushi who’s platforms in the previous few weeks were offering returns of thousands of percent.

**CAKE’s** [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/) highest return was Eternal-BSB with an APR of 686%. Eternal is a $70 million play to earn game.

The highest APR on **Sushi’s** platform is 373% from ATTR-WETH. ATTR is a $31 million project that can be used to track any asset on any blockchain in the crypto space.

Pancakeswap is offering a generous 75% for staking its own currency CAKE, which compares to 25% for staking SUSHI on Sushi’s platform.

It was pleasing to see a new easier to use UI on **Yearn’s** platform which clearly displayed its highest APRs among one of its most prominent features.

**Auto** is offering what appears a very attractive 998% APR by staking WBNB-CAKE. This is worth further investigation.

Finally **Venus’** 49% APR for staking BNB seems an attractive proposition if you are a holder and fan of BNB.",2,2021-12-14 12:30:09,17

ADA,Altcoin,Deep Dive on Solana ($SOL)- NOT a Shitcoin and The Most Undervalued Top 15 Altcoin (IMO),"Hello! Wanted to share my thoughts on Solana, a blockchain platform that I believe has the most upside potential of the top \~15 cryptocurrencies currently on the market.

Coinmarket Cap Link - [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/)

**The Founding Story (**[Source](https://docs.solana.com/history)**)**

* **Solana's Founder Anatoly Yakovenko spent the bulk of his professional career at Qualcomm, Dropbox, and Mesosphere** where he spent a lot of time designing distributed systems and figuring out how to get different systems of software and hardware to talk to each other
* It was at Qualcomm that Anatoly met two of his other **Solana co-founders, Greg Fitzgerald and Stephen Akridge** and the three of them spent nearly a decade working together
* **Greg had an expertise in languages** and compilers and he convinced Anatoly to migrate Solana’s codebase from the C programming language to Rust and became the CTO of Solana
* **Stephen led the GPU backend that constantly beat Nvidia** and he demonstrated that massive amounts of time could be saved through GPUs leading Anatoly to recruit him to the team in early 2018
* The **Solana founding team had about a decade of experience working together** solving complex software and hardware problems at Qualcomm and **you don’t find many founding teams with such deep qualified shared work histories like this in the crypto space**
* Solana was the name of a beach in San Diego where the three of them would often surf so the name doesn’t really have particular significance beyond that

**Proof of Work vs. Stake vs. History**

* **What sets Solana apart from its competitors is its core innovation, Proof of History**
* To understand Proof of History and why it’s different, we first need to go over the method Bitcoin made famous which is proof of work and this is what Ethereum currently uses as well (explaining this for the beginners on the sub)
   * For **proof of work**, when person A sends a transaction to person B through a blockchain, there are 1000s of computers also known as miners that work to confirm the transaction by solving tiny math problems and once a number of computers agree that a transaction is correct, then the transaction goes through, a block is produced, and the computers are rewarded with tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum
      * **This basically is the essence of the buzzword decentralization** you hear so often because instead of one centralized system like the US Treasury that mints money, a crowd of people are earning money in the form of tokens through computers
      * There are large mining farms across the world that have thousands of computers making computations to earn tokens through Proof of Work and this has caused many to worry about all the electricity consumption cryptocurrency mining is resulting in
      * **But the bigger problem with proof of work is that it’s much too slow** with Bitcoin and Ethereum both struggling to scale beyond 15 transactions per second and **in addition to that, average fees per transaction currently (as of 5/19/21) sit at** [$13 for bitcoin](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m) **and** [$21 for Ethereum](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#3m) which is just way too high
   * In interviews, Anatoly states that he views Bitcoin and Ethereum more as revolutionary proof of concept products rather than platforms structured to serve worldwide audiences (debatable point of view ofc)
      * **Bitcoin** proved that cryptography could be used to create currencies while **Ethereum** proved that blockchain technology could be used for smart contracts BUT **neither were built with the knowledge of how massive crypto would get and how transaction fees would skyrocket**
* The next development to improve upon Proof of Work is called **Proof of Stake**, which is something Ethereum is trying to migrate to but there have been many delays
   * **In proof of work,** the miners who are willing to spend more on energy consumption are selected to confirm the transactions on the blockchain
   * **In proof of stake,** miners are called validators and validators are chosen based on the amount of money they lock away or how much they have ""staked"" and the more validators have staked, the more likely they will be chosen to confirm transactions and thus earn tokens
      * If a bad actor tries to attack the network or do something sketchy, the tokens he/she has ""staked"" will be taken away (this is known as slashing) and provides a layer of protection against bad actors
      * **PoS completely gets rid of the need to consume massive amounts of energy** and is a much more sophisticated approach that many cryptocurrencies have migrated to
* This is where Solana's **Proof of History** comes in
   * Solana still uses proof of stake as its method of verifying blocks, but Anatoly pushed it forward by creating a consensus mechanism called Proof of History and this is at the core is what makes Solana unique
   * **The trouble with decentralized systems is that you have thousands of computers working together to verify transactions but they each use their own clocks and don’t have a common notion of time**
      * As a result, most blockchain infrastructures require validators to talk to each other to agree on the time before verifying transactions and producing the next block
      * **This results in notable delays in the network and is the reason Bitcoin produces blocks only every 10 minutes and Ethereum every 15 seconds**
      * Here's an analogy: imagine that there is an army of 1000 soldiers who in this analogy represent each validator. Each soldier has his own watch and so the time to each soldier is what he believes the time to be, but the actual time may be off by a few seconds or minutes
      * This means that if a general wants the solders to execute an order at a very specific time, he needs to get all the soldiers to agree on the time before that order is fulfilled correctly which is basically what is happening in current blockchain infrastructures
   * **With Proof of History, all computers on the network agree on a universal time through what’s called a SHA-256, sequential-hashing verifiable delay function**
      * **Proof of history results in 0 delays in the network and no waiting around for other validators to agree on the time**
      * **As a result, while most of the latest proof of stake blockchains have blocktimes of a few seconds, Solana is able to achieve blocktimes of 0.4 seconds, and this is why Proof of History is a giant leap forward**

**Why Solana is a Gamechanger (**[reference this chart for this section](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium)**)**

* The primary reason is **Solana’s ability to scale**
   * Solana can currently achieve **blocktimes of 0.4 seconds** and **65,000 transactions per second** which makes **Solana one of the fastest blockchain infrastructures in the world**
   * What’s more is that as internet bandwidth and CPU and GPU improve, **block times can reduce and transactions per second can increase theoretically scale to infinity** with a 1gb network supporting about 700,000 TPS and a 10 gb network being able to support 7 million TPS
      * To be fair, this is true for most other crypto platforms as well
   * In comparison, **Visa requires 65,000 transactions per second**, and the **NASDAQ exchange requires 500,000, so Solana can support databases at any scale**
      * This is an extremely important development because applications as large as Facebook or exchanges like the NASDAQ can eventually be built on the Solana platform without performance issues and without enormous fees
* Solana’s capabilities are also better understood when compared against the competition
   * **Solana currently supports the highest transactions per second for a crypto with a working product** (this is from my knowledge, please correct me if I'm mistaken)
      * Though Ethereum 2.0 can scale to 100K transactions per second, the upgrade has yet to come
      * Cardano's hydra solution can scale to 1MM per second, but has no mainnet (launching in August 2021)
   * But more importantly, **Solana is miles ahead in block time versus the rest of the field due to proof of history and block times will also come down with time as well** with Anatoly on the record saying he envisions messages across Solana traveling at the speed of light
   * In addition, **Solana also offers extremely low transaction costs at $0.00001 meaning that 1 million transactions would only cost $10 and Solana also has more validators than the rest** of the field besides Avalanche ([chart reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium))
   * Github stars is a bit of a vanity metric and are similar to Facebook likes but basically even though Solana has only been around for a few years, it has a **pretty high number of Github stars which slightly demonstrates the interest developers have in the project** ([chart reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium))
   * And lastly **Solana is a complete layer 1 solution** meaning that everything is built on the Solana blockchain vs. Ethereum 2.0 and Polkadot which are two of Solana’s biggest competitors which utilize sharding ([chart reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&name=medium))
      * Sharding isn't a dealbreaker based on my research and I'm an ETH holder just to be clear but I do think having everything on a Layer 1 solution is cleaner
* All of this is why **Sam Bankman Fried, a prominent figure in the crypto community and founder of the exchange FTX, chose to operate Serum on Solana after a year of testing out different options**
   * In case you’re unfamiliar with it, FTX has been growing rapidly over the past 12 months and as a fun fact, the exchange recently paid for the rights to call the Miami Heat Arena FTX Arena

**Why I Believe Solana Can 3X-5X**

* The logic behind this is very simple and relates to **relative valuation** and this also is based on the assumption that the crypto market continues its bull run
   * Personally, I think we're in the mid to late stages of a crypto bubble, so what I've written below will not come true if the market collapses
* **As of 5/18/21, Solana's Market Cap = $14.6BN, Polkadot = $36.4BN, Cardano = $64.5BN**
   * I think Solana's tech makes it a pretty **undervalued cryptocurrency** just compared to other projects currently on the market
      * I'm not trying to ding other cryptos or say that other projects are bad, just saying I think Solana should be worth more than it is today based on these market caps
   * Why is this? I'm not sure, and perhaps it's because it's a relatively new project (founded in 2018) vs. the other ones so not as many investors are aware
      * **It's also possible I may have missed something, so please let me know if there is reason to doubt Solana or if other projects are just far superior**
   * Anyhow, all this is why if I had to choose one coin the top 15 right now, I would bet on Solana, and I am personally invested in it right now (for full disclosure)

**TLDR**:  Solana is one of the most performant blockchains in the crypto space, using an innovative technology called Proof of History to solve the scalability problem currently faced by earlier technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0. Solana has the potential to 3X-5X, considering that it has superior technology compared to many competitors that have much higher market caps and much fewer actual projects in their ecosystems.",37,2021-05-18 16:46:40,17

From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

The market took a hit this week dropping by nearly 13%, 5% of that fall happening in the last 24 hours. However by the time you read this there will no doubt have been another notable market movement. And that is why our general rule is to focus on the micro not the macro. Focus on what you can control - or at least have some element of control over!

Our list saw every one of our selected cryptocurrencies apart from three in negative territory with most seeing at least 20% wiped off their market value. It was not a pretty site!

**The week’s winners were:**

Lunch Money +38%

Faceter +13%

DAPS +7%

**And the biggest losers:**

Rarible -35%

Bridge Mutual -33%

Hybrix -29%

Handshake - 27%

We didn’t add any tokens this week although we have at least one lined up for you next week due diligence depending.

We removed two projects this week, Alpaca and Polkerstarter. We believe Alpaca doesn't offer anything different to the many operators in this market. We are also nervous about the SEC and state regulators targeting this space. For the same reason we have removed Polkerstarter. It is only a matter of time before the SEC targets the launchpad model and Polkerstarter will be at the top of their list.

**View this week’s Micro Cap Watch List** [**here**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/micro-cap-watch-list/)

ADA,Altcoin,World Mobile Token (WMT) - paving the way to mass adoption,"It’s been a while since I wrote a DD on World Mobile Token (WMT) but so much has happened that I think it’s worth updating my previous post with the latest developments. I’ll be using a fair bit of info from my one of my previous posts as I want to make sure everything is covered.
  

The TLDR of WMT is that they’re a Telecommunications company first and foremost. What separates them from the other 1000 Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) is that they are combining Cardano's blockchain technology as well as the Sharing Economy business model (think Uber and Airbnb).  Their mission is to connect the unconnected and finally bridge the digital divide the separates the haves from the have-nots. The poor get poorer because they don’t have the same privileges that the wealthy do. Internet access will level the playing field as things we take for granted such as education, healthcare and financial services is just a click away. Let that sink in for a bit before you read on. This is an incredibly important project that, if they succeed, will immediately be beneficial to any other crypto project you’re invested in as the other half of the global population will finally have access to crypto.

Global Telecoms Industry stats


• 1000 Mobile Network Operators (MNO) providing internet access to 52% of the world. 

• $2.6 trillion global telecommunications industry 

• 3.7B people (48%) without internet access 

• Therefore circa $2.6 trillion left on the table (or under a mattress)

Africa stats


• Average age 19.7 years old 

• 1.2B people in Africa 

• 54% have mobile phones 

• 78% have ZERO internet access

Market Cap of World Mobile VS other Mobile Network Operators


• World Mobile USD$70 million 

• Vodafone USD$50 BILLION 

• Singtel/Optus USD$40B 

• Telstra USD$31B


Take this comparison with a grain of salt as it’s hard to compare MC of traditional stocks vs crypto. But still, the upside is apparent.

Sharing economy


I didn't quite understand this term until someone pointed out other examples such as Uber and AirBnB, who both use the Sharing Economy business model. With this in mind, it makes sense how World Mobile will be able to keep costs low (approximately 12 times cheaper than legacy MNOs) when other MNOs have failed to do the same. Because basically, the infrastructure is built and maintained by the customer. Other MNOs have to invest capital into costly towers, and then have their tiny profit margins eaten into when something goes wrong and they need to pay an expensive engineer to drive a few days through unpaved terrain, pay for food and accommodation. The World Mobile customer, who earns revenue from their Air Node, takes care of all of this, including making sure no one steals, vandalises or damages the equipment.

Cardano - Cardano is a top 5 coin in terms of Market Cap size (not counting stablecoings) but the what sets them apart from the other Layer 1s is that their blockchain is peer reviewed (90+ papers) and mathematically proven to work. Charles Hoskinson, Founder of Cardano, has been heavily criticised for how long it has taken to get Cardano to where it is today when other Blockchains have passed them by (albeit with expensive consequences, see Terra Luna). But his reasoning is akin to building an Airplane. If people are going to put their lives/livelihoods into his creation, he is going to make sure there are no issues with it. The fact that a company like Cardano/IOHK have not only partnered with World Mobile, but also have a 10% equity stake in World Mobile (IOHK have no stake in any other Cardano Project) speaks volumes about how critical World Mobile’s success will be to their own mission in Banking the Unbanked, which you can’t do until you Connect the Unconnected. In the crypto world, Cardano's name is comparable to Google, Amazon or Tesla.
Here's some link for easy reference if you wanted to read further.


Fulham FC – Fulham won the 2022 Champions League and will therefore be promoted to the English Premier League next season. This is a 3 year partnership. This is NOT a sponsorship deal where World Mobile simply paid huge sums of money to have their logo on the front of Fulham jerseys. The partnership runs deeper. How? Good question, I never asked. Someone find out please!
  

EPSON – That’s right. The $6.6 billion Printer company partnered with WM in November 2021 to support education and bring new opportunities to the unconnected schools in Africa, where WM provided internet connectivity and EPSON supplied the printers and projectors. Not exactly a price catalyst but a solid boost in credibility nonetheless.

Starlink, Microsoft and Google – Starlink has been heavily “hinted at” by the founders (several pics of founders visiting SpaceX invite-only restricted areas). My guess is a partnership is there so that Starlink can act as a backhaul option but has yet to be formally announced due to legal reasons. However, all three have been named in their “Partnerships, Collaborations, Vendor & Supply Chain Team” list https://worldmobile.io/blog/post/deployment-diary/
  

Let’s pause for a moment and imagine Elon tweeting a pic of 
himself wearing a Fulham FC Jersey with the WM logo on full display.

Physical Assets
 


This is what separates World Mobile Token from every other crypto project. Ok I take that back. Everything I wrote above separates WMT from everything. But the physical, tangible assets that World Mobile have deployed on the ground (and in the air) is clear proof to skeptics that WMT is not magic internet money like some see crypto to be. They have a blimp for f*cks sake! A BLIMP! It’s technically an Aerostat, but whatever you want to call it, it’s a big-ass balloon 300 metres up in the sky with WORLD MOBILE printed on the side, holding hundreds of kilograms worth of equipment that will provide internet access to everyone underneath within a 70km radius. There are several benefits of having (unmanned) Aerostats instead of Cell-phone towers but cost is a huge factor. Just two of these bad boys and Zanzibar will be covered (first one goes up end of July 2022), and around 100 of them will cover unconnected areas of Tanzania. 

  

Other assets include: 

• Air Nodes - imagine a pole with a couple of solar powered panels, a light on top, a couple of batteries at the bottom, and a big ass modem/router in the middle as one example (there will be many iterations). Air Nodes will provide high speed internet to everyone within a 100m – 200m radius, as well as electricity thanks to the solar power panels and batteries. Click here to see what happened to this tiny fishing village that previously had no electricity, light, or internet: https://youtu.be/hYlLA9emiaw. Under the Sharing Economy business model, Air Nodes will be owned and operated by the local community. My basic understanding is that, if I lived in the middle of nowhere, with no electricity and internet, we would simply download the hardware (off the shelf) specs off World Mobile website, followed the instructions provided on putting everything together and setting it up, I would eventually be connected to the internet and anyone around me would also be able to connect using my Air Node (after they paid for a pre-paid data pack from the nearest shop using local fiat). Once they connected to my Air Node, I would earn revenue depending on how many people were connected. And at twice the speeds of competitors as well as half the price, I can’t imagine people not connecting if given the option. 

  

• Earth Nodes – there will be a maximum of 1000 of these. Most of them have been reserved but the final 100 or so are being auctioned off. About 15 have already been sold at the time of writing. First year ROI is set to be at least 50% / 50,000 WMT from inflation rewards alone. The bigger draw to own and operate an earth node is that Earth Node Operators (ENOs) will earn a percentage of revenue from users/subcribers. An Earth Node is basically a computer that validates transactions on the block chain. That’s crypto speak for an automated Finance / Book-keeping team processing the paperwork (possibly a terrible analogy but I’m dumbing it down as much as I can because… well, I’m dumb myself and that’s how I understand it). The way ENOs get paid is also what makes it easy for me to say WMT is not a Ponzi/Pyramid scheme. With a lot of sh*tcoins, investors make money when other investors buy in after them. But with WMT the process is like this: 

1. Local internet user pays cash for data card and use WM internet service 

2. Cash goes into WM treasury 

3. WM Treasury uses the cash to buy WMT on market / exchanges 

4. WM distributes WM Token to ENOs 

5. Profit 

  

This process drives the price up organically, not from investors investing. But from people purchasing internet data packages. Of course, price will also be driven up by investors but it’s not necessary like other crypto projects.

**The metaverse is everywhere**

It seems that the crypto community is way ahead of the curve. Nothing new there. Facebook announced that they had changed their name to Meta to reflect their focus on the metaverse. Whilst blockchain entrepreneurs have been developing metaverse applications for a few years now Facebook gave it mainstream recognition. Before that announcement the average person hadn't even heard of the metaverse and if they had they didn't have a clue what it meant.

Here is a brief definition for those in the metaverse beginner camp:

A shared, realistic, and immersive computer simulation of the real world or other possible worlds, in which people participate as digital avatars.

Investors are piling into cryptocurrencies which have even a faint connection to the metaverse. 

The top 5 cryptos in the metaverse space are:

Axie Infinity $7.0bn

Decentraland $5.0bn

The Sandbox $5.1bn

Enjin Coin $2.9bn

Illuvium $0.8bn

A few long shots worth a closer look:

Somnium $0.2bn

Rentible $7m

The metaverse is an interesting concept to investigate, from an investors point of view anyway. There are two plays. The first is investing in the cryptocurrency and the second is buying land. Let’s take Decentraland for instance. Its fully diluted market cap of $10 billion is priced to perfection. In other words, the valuation already assumes they will be a leading player in this market going forward. And that thinking is also priced into the value of their virtual land which is selling for up to millions of dollars. 

Virtual land is like real estate. It is in finite supply with location playing an important role in its value. Canny investors are buying up virtual land plots on various metaverses expecting to either develop it, rent it or flip it.

The metaverse is set to be part of our future. However, a few words of warning. Don't go rushing out to buy the next shiny metaverse project. 99.9% of the new projects coming to market will fail. Also remember, buying virtual land comes with risk. Like buying land in the real world, if you purchase a plot within a metaverse where there are few visitors your land will have as much value as buying land in the middle of the Sahara. 

**dYdX and the perpetual**

Let’s start with, what is a perpetual?

A perpetual swap is something similar to a futures contract. The core difference is that perpetuals do not have expiration dates. 

dYdX’s perpetuals have proved so popular that they have eclipsed Coinbase in daily volumes. It achieved this by solely offering perpetual for four assets. dYdX is now one of the most liquid exchanges in crypto.

**Rapid fire**

The influential FATF (Financial Action Task Force) **wants governments to hold the people behind DeFi protocols accountable**. This will send the shivers down the backs of the many platforms that have decided on anonymity. This proposal is not likely to come in for some time, but it is something that we can see being implemented and enforced ruthlessly.

Muslim leaders have warned their flock that **crypto is forbidden**. According to these well-informed individuals, ‘it has elements of uncertainty, wagering, and harm’.

Binance CEO announced that he intends to **give away up to 99% of his wealth**. No doubt this raised the eyebrows of US authorities who will be eyeing much of his wealth for themselves!

Binance made **Know Your Customer (KYC) mandatory** for global users in their effort to make Binance a regulatory compliant business. 

In another attack on the DeFi space. BlockFi, which offers high interest rates to investors, is being **investigated by the SEC**. The SEC considers that BlockFi’s interest accounts represent the offering of unregistered securities, something that no doubt the SEC will use to target many other high profile yield farming platforms in the near future.

Cardano the blockchain platform has **achieved over 20 million transactions worth over $18 billion**. That figure is only slightly lower than that of Bitcoin and compares to Ethereum’s $9 billion. The price of ADA however is in the doldrums with many complaining of the lack of DAPPs because of its complex programming language. 

eToro announced it was **delisting Cardano and TRON** by the end of the year for US customers as it believes these coins could represent securities.

Staking and yield farming has been a major driver in the huge growth in the DeFi sector. Investors are being enticed by the massive APRs on offer. Totally new projects tempting investors with returns of 10,000+ % are able to attract a deluge of money from investors who don’t seem concerned with the high risks involved.

**Guest Article**

**Catchy by name Catchy by nature**

A tracker wallet that has to be tried to be appreciated!

Tired of manually adding token addresses to Trustwallet? Tired of seeing out-of-date and inaccurate balances? Tired of switching apps to check on your multiple wallets? We present CATCHY, an innovative solution that facilitates wallet tracking, implemented directly on Telegram, the flagship crypto platform. CATCHY aims to provide a suite of crypto tracking tools for Telegram users. From the currently available multichain (BSC + ETH) Telegram wallet tracker, to the upcoming whale watcher, price alert, and sniper bot tools, our vision is to create an ecosystem that satisfies all crypto enthusiast needs. Today, we’ll give a small overview of our multi chain wallet tracker and the many useful features it has to offer.

Our Telegram wallet tracker is made with both accessibility and convenience in mind. Simply talk to one of our tracker bots (found in our Telegram group [CATCHYTOKEN](https://t.me/CATCHYTOKEN)), and it will direct you to the tracker bot you were specifically assigned to. From there on out, you’ll only use one command: /wallet. On your first use, the bot will notify you that you haven’t added any wallet addresses to the tracker and will ask you about the blockchain you wish to use. Keep in mind that you can add up to 3 wallets at any time, and they can belong to different blockchains, so your choice here isn’t final. Reply to the tracker bot’s message with a wallet address of your choosing, and you’re good to go! 

Note that the tracker DOES NOT require a wallet connection, making it the absolute safest option to keep tabs on your balances. The tracker can never be linked back to your person either, as it relies on an anonymous numerical ID that is unique to each individual. The bot you were assigned to will remember you through that ID, so you’ll never have to go through the setup process again.

After you’re done with the first step, the tracker will immediately attempt to fetch your wallet balances based on publicly available data. Just wait a couple seconds and VOILA: the balance of every token in your wallet, valued in USD and BNB/ETH (depending on the chain), ranked by value. These values are the most up-to-date balances you can fetch, as they rely on the BSC and ETH blockchains directly instead of waiting for other services to supply prices (like Trustwallet for example). From this point onwards, you’ll rarely ever need to use /wallet again, as the buttons supplied under your balance sheet are more than enough to satisfy any needs you might have. 

The \[Refresh\] button immediately updates your balances, the \[Gains\] button enables percentage gain calculation from the last time you pressed \[Refresh\], the \[MC\] button adds the market cap of every token directly into the balance sheet, and the \[Charts\] button offers immediate access to the charts of your tokens. The \[Manage\] button allows you to add wallets (up to 3) or remove existing ones, as well as play around with language settings (English and Chinese are available at the moment). 

At CATCHY, your convenience is our utmost priority, and we hope that is reflected in the intuitive design of our tracker and its ease of use. However, our most convenient feature is one that you’ll rarely ever notice: Scam/Dead token filtering. Unlike sites like poocoin, where you have to manually hide dust and dead tokens, our tracker automatically does that for you by employing our own filtering system. And if our system oversteps its boundaries, you can use the \[Show Missing & Hide Existing Tokens\] button to take full control of your tracker’s output. These choices will be saved forever, so you’ll never have to reconfigure your balance sheet. 

Our tracker strikes a delicate balance between convenience and complexity, offering you extensive control of what you see without sacrificing simplicity and accessibility. The tracker is currently free for users to try and explore, but in the near future, you will have to hold CATCHY to make use of its features, making it the first of many use cases that are coming down the line. Please visit our website https://catchy.finance/ for further details on the tracker and other products currently in the works.

ADA,Altcoin,Weekly Staking and Yield Farming Review," **About us: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at www.cryptoquestion.tech**

Last week’s review caused quite the stir. Our review of Toad Network -  [TOAD.Network price, TOAD chart, market cap, and info | CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/toad-network) \- upset a few of the Toad loyalists who tried to convince us that their technology made this both a platform and an investment not to be missed. However as we pointed out to these misguided soles, it is not all about technology. 

The crypto community has for some reason got fixated on the technology ignoring the user experience. You could have the best technology in the DeFi space but if the platform is difficult to navigate and you can't quickly and easily stake your cryptocurrency you will leave and head somewhere else where you can. That is the situation with Toad. The user experience is dreadful. If I can't work out how to make an investment on a platform without a degree in computer science then I want to do one of two things, beat the developer to an inch of his life for wasting my time or find an alternative platform. The second option is always the most sensible. 

We have not been deterred by the backlash from last week’s review and will be reviewing three new platforms for you. As you will shortly discover, one of these we found particularly irksome. 

**Before we get into that,** [**here** ](https://cryptoquestion.tech/stakingandfarming/)**is this week’s table of APRs from leading platforms.**

The biggest developments are…

**Pancakeswap**

It’s new addition to the ranks is RPG-BUSD paying 292%. You can also stake RPG and earn 78%. RPG in our opinion has very poor tokenomics with its maximum token circulation 50 times higher than its current level. That is one to avoid just for that reason. 

**Sushi**

The highest APR in this week’s table is from the pair INV-WETH which is paying a racy 9,198%. Inverse Finance is a yield aggregator with healthy volume but looks a little overvalued when you compare it with its TVL. But at such a high APR it is worth a closer look.

**Auto**

Auto’s highest rate this year is 213% for the pair WBNB- BSCPAD. BSCPAD is a launchpad in the competitive space of IDOs. A better bet is WBNB-Auto which is paying 95%.

**Venus**

We liked the look of the 42.27% payable when staking BNB, that is an attractive APR for a top cryptocurrency.

**Platform Reviews**

**Olive Cash**

OliveCash is a cross chain Yield Farming project running on Binance Smart Chain Avalanche chain.

OliveCash has the goal of fostering AMM, Yield Farming and DeFi markets by facilitating the participation of traditional investors to the Crypto Ecosystem. To increase protocol economical sustainability, they aim at increasing burning fees and defining additional deflationary strategies benefitting holders.

**Our Opinion**

Let’s look at the figures. Market cap of the token is $1 million, TVL $2 million and 24 hour volume circa $100,000. Is this a bargain? I hear you ask. A quick review of their platform would confirm their intentions, that they do make investing for traditional investors easy. Yes their platform is a copy of Pancakeswap but it does the job.

They have a wide range of farms and pools available with a top APY of 1,267% when you farm AMPLE - BNB. This is a pretty attractive APY considering the strong liquidity supporting AMPLE. You can also earn 153% by staking OLIVE. That is a bet on whether you truly believe OLIVE is undervalued. From a quick analysis OliveCash could well be worth a small flutter.

**AstroSwap**

AstroSwap is the first interstellar DEX, built for the most loyal blockchain community - the Cardano ecosystem. The project’s IDO will be launched exclusively on Adapad exclusive. It is powered by WagyuSwap and Incubated by BlueZilla.

**Our Opinion**

The above description is their own. Written by someone with their head up their own asses we would imagine, but let's not be quick to judge. Let's review the numbers before taking a look at their platform. The market cap is $80 million with a fully diluted value of $3.3 billion and 24 hour volume of a healthy $1.3 million. What isn't so healthy is the tokens valuation. Yes everything Cardano related is somehow commanding a premium but this ridiculous valuation leaves no upside for the investor. As an investment Astro should be avoided with two 10 feet barge poles!

As far as the platform is concerned, well there is nothing to talk about. The staking platform is coming soon. How the market can value something with no platform at $3 billion is beyond us. The tokenomics in this project stink! Avoid.

**Corgiswap**

Corgiswap is a new DEX and DeFi Fork from Pancakeswap that lets users exchange tokens while also providing liquidity through farming and earning fees. It's a decentralized exchange for transferring BEP20 tokens on Binance Smart Chain first launched in July 2021. Users trade against a liquidity pool in CORGISWAP's automated market maker model and deposit funds into these pools in exchange for liquidity provider tokens, which are then used to fill the pools. These tokens can then be redeemed for a portion of the pool as well as a portion of the trading fees. Users can also farm additional tokens like CORGI and CORIS using CORGISWAP or put liquidity provider tokens on the farm and receive CORIS as a reward.

**Our Opinion**

Corgiswap has a fully diluted market cap of $21 million and 24 hour volume of circa $100,000. Its TVL is not readily available, You can earn 74% by staking its native token; however without the information on the platform’s TVL it is very difficult to make a judgment on the value of the token and the potential of the platform. We would suggest Olive Cash is a better bet.

**Market Overview**

September has been a pretty negative month with the overall market seeing its value decline by 7%. The fear and greed index slipped back into extreme fear and now sits at fear. However there are reasons to be positive. Firstly the Chairman of the Fed, Jerome Powell, told congress he did not intend to ban crypto currency, although he said stablecoins needed greater regulatory oversight. Secondly, the massive recent negativity surrounding China’s ban on crypto looks to have been overdone as usual. It is evident that the Chinese crypto enthusiast has no intention of letting the crypto revolution pass him by. It appears as though they have started trading through DEX’s as witnessed by the surge in trade on Dydx. Finally the Chair of the SEC said that he supported a bitcoin ETF, another positive step forward for the industry. So all in all a positive week.

**Trending**

**Regulators target DeFi**

The SEC is investigating Uniswap Labs, the organization behind the leading DEX Uniswap. It is early days yet but is a sign of things to come. That news was followed by the announcement that New Jersey had served a cease and desist order on Celsius, a leading yield farming platform which advertises, ‘earn 17% yield on your crypto’. Alabama and Texas are also looking at doing the same. Both Celsius and Uniswap rolled out the same statement that they are willing to work with regulators. Finally, Coinbase was told in no uncertain terms that if they continued with their plans to launch a lending platform the SEC would sue. Whilst Coinbase continued to deny that lending represented a regulated activity, they had no choice but to shelve or bin their proposals.

Check out our [Staking and Yield Farming Review](https://medium.com/the-capital/weekly-staking-and-yield-farming-review-23rd-september-2021-6904585050c4) which sets out our thinking on these regulatory actions and what strategy investors should follow.

**The UK’s Post Office enters crypto**

Yes you heard it right! The Post Office announced that its app can be used to connect to a decentralized exchange called Swarm Markets, from there vouchers can be purchased that are redeemable for crypto. British politicians were up in arms about the announcement. The fully diluted market cap of Swarm is a modest $70 million, could be worth a closer look assuming the unhappy politicians don’t get their way.

**That old chestnut - China**

The recent stumble in the crypto market was blamed on China’s now outright ban of crypto no doubt to protect it’s digital yuan which it is rolling out. This should be no surprise. China has been tough on crypto for some time, the only surprise is this didn't happen sooner. Crypto will do just fine without China.

**Binance again**

Every month there is never any shortage of negative stories to write about when it comes to Binance’s trials and tribulations. This month saw the announcement that both the IRS and the DOJ are investigating. It is reported that this is for market manipulation and insider trading. Binance also announced it was withdrawing from yet another market, Singapore. We do hope that investors who use Binance’s central wallet have started to move their crypto into their own wallet.

**Robinhood and PayPal**

Robinhood announced that they were rolling out a crypto wallet with transfer features allowing customers to store crypto and move in and out of their apps. The market considers Robinhood a serious threat to Coinbase’s business with this move. Meanwhile back in the grey and damp UK PayPal announced they were introducing crypto trading services through their PayPal accounts. Of course there is a limited selection of coins available including the Bitcoin fork Bitcoin Cash valued at a ridiculous $10 billion.

**Cardano introducing its own stablecoin**

September saw the launch of the much anticipated and long overdue smart contract functionality on the Cardano blockchain. Named the Djed, it is an algorithmic stablecoin as compared to one backed by fiat. Its new stable coin is expected to make transaction costs on the Cardano network cheaper and more predictable. Its announcement comes at a time when US regulators are considering regulating or banning stablecoins.

**Finally…**

There is talk that the SEC is investigating Tether, the leading stablecoin player. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone following the shenanigans at Tether over their total lack of transparency since inception. There have been multiple reports of investigations into breaching banking and security laws.

Syrius Zenon wallet introduction https://youtu.be/t6A7vKhp-MY

based anon explanation What is it: Incredibly fast, almost infinitely scalable state-of-the-art DLT. It combines the block-lattice architecture that was first(?) used by Raiblocks/Nano with a DAG that exists as a separate layer for the consensus. The block-lattice handles the transactions. It's going to be used to scale Web3 dapps as a L1, and also process transactions as a L2 chain.

Who does it: This is an independent, open-source project and will probably be run by a foundation similar to Ethereum and Cardano, but I'm about 99.5% sure its backed by Square. I can enumerate the zillions of times they have hinted as such if I really have to here, but you can search for old biz posts on Zenon here and also on Warosu.

Square will likely use it to scale Bitcoin transactions where the default payment for merchants and Cashapp users is made in BTC, and then they can set it to dollars or pounds or whatever afterwards.

Its open source and not owned by Square, like how Node.js isn't owned by Google but has wide adoption. They'll easily recruit 1000s of legacy web apps for this bc no code changes are needed, and also dapps on Ethereum will easily switch over.",15,2021-04-29 20:56:30,12
ADA,Altcoin,A Paradigm Shift; how can we use it? (Charity Tokens and Sustainable/Ethical Cryptocurrencies),"I believe we're a part of a paradigm shift occurring globally and am posting this because I want your ideas, I want to learn about new projects that are doing good and making positive changes to peoples lives and the environment, and that you will share what you've learned along the way.

***What is the paradigm shift?***

We're moving to decentralized technology. The shift aims to remove a central authority and create immunity to government interference or manipulation. Currently, this is fueled by cryptocurrencies such as BTC, Eth, etc shifting the store of value from FIAT, ultimately, allowing these cryptocurrency communities to become the decision-maker.

...so my question is if we're becoming the decision-makers; how do we leverage the capital inflows to change people's lives for the better and help mitigate the impact and risks of climate change?

***What I've learned?***

**1) Why there is so much capital flowing into assets and increasing the price of cryptocurrency:** The world has seen governments ramp up quantitative easing measures across most major countries globally. For example, the U.S with $1.9T, which has resulted in significant capital flowing through the systems; reserve banks buy bonds from gov (which means the government borrows money from the Reserve Bank), who use the borrowed money (bond) and spend it on citizens (stimulus packages, COVID relief, etc), this goes into the hands of citizens.. Governments also buy company bonds (lend companies money) that invest this money into new investments, products, services, or goods to create GDP or simply, pay their staff, etc - which means more people get hired and have money and invest...interest rates are also very low, which means companies (and people) can borrow easily. In layman's terms, a lot of people globally now have discretionary funds to invest, which is why most asset classes (including Crypto) are seeing all-time highs.

**2) Mining is energy-intensive and often bad for the environment**.. with some studies claiming the electricity needed to mine bitcoin is more than used by 'entire countries'.

**3) There has been a recent rise in self-generating liquidity tokens** that redistribute transaction fees to holders to 'moon which seems to be focused mostly on wealth creation - but what about governance, charities/the environment?

**Summary:**

With so much capital inflows into Cryptocurrencies, a major paradigm shift occurring globally to decentralized ways of living we should be starting to think about how can we use this momentum to do better, right?

\> LOOKING FOR PROJECTS FOCUSED ON ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, CHARITIES & ETHICAL WORK <

When doing some research, I found one that looks legit and some information about coins that don't consume much energy, would appreciate input or feedback:

***Charity Tokens (here is an awesome one I recently found!):*** [***https://www.milktoken.net/***](https://www.milktoken.net/)

**1) Milk and Butter Token (charity token)** that has already raised $25k (which is awesome given they only have a \~$1m market cap) with Food for Life Charity Global (which has projects occupying over 60 countries and volunteers who provide up to 2,000,000 free meals daily!). 

Looks like the token gathers fees on every Butter transaction and the holders of the Butter token can then use their tokens to cast their vote on which charity should receive the next donation.. Tokens are also deflationary so it looks like holders will be rewarded over time.

**2) Sustainable Coins based on Kilowatt hour (KWh) consumed per transaction**

XRP does 0.0079

Dogecoin 0.12

Cardano 0.5479

If anyone knows of any coins offsetting their energy usage or any awesome charity tokens you guys have found please let me know!",48,2021-05-04 23:39:26,8
ADA,Altcoin,This Week’s Micro Cap Watch List - Latest Moonshots and Altcoin Resources,"&#x200B;

**About your author:** **CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from our weekly** [**Moonshot Monday**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/weekly-podcast/) **podcast to our weekly Staking and Farming Review. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

The last few weeks have seen us devoting a disproportionate amount of time researching undervalued and undiscovered micro caps. Last week we revealed seven micro caps with market values under $2m, you can read the article here. This week we have been hunting for gems with market caps under $1m. It’s been an eye opening experience to say the least. Whilst there are few gems in this micro cap space they are there and as we all know, if you get it right it can be very lucrative. That is what gives us inspiration!

So with that said let’s look at how our current list has performed.

There appeared to be a bout of profit taking this week with a handful of projects which have enjoyed strong price runs over the last few weeks taking a hit. Other than that the list held its ground with only one significant performer.

**The main winners were:**

Faceter +46%

Handshake +11%

**And the losers:**

Candela -65%

Rentible -36%

PlotX -28%

We added only one project to our list this week.

**Lunch Money (LMY) -** [**https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lunch-money**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lunch-money)

Lunch Money describes itself as a universal loyalty rewards program, created by Restaurant Private I Inc, a mystery shopper platform aimed at improving customer service through anonymous customer oversights and incentives. Restaurant customers and restaurant delivery service customers can simply earn Lunch Money (LMY) by providing real feedback on their service experience.

Lunch Money has been around now for a few years with the token price having fallen from a high of $0.26 to its current price of $0.003, that’s a 99% reduction. But the project is far from dead. The team have been quietly beavering away building a new platform and establishing partnerships. Amazingly it is one of the few crypto projects registered with the US’s Securities Exchange Commission.

This is the kind of project that could go viral very easily. Why wouldn’t you provide a restaurant review if you are being paid to do so? This project is all about getting traction. It is in exactly the right spot, the gig economy. With a fully diluted market cap of $500,000 this project is a long shot but could well end up being a gem hidden under a mound of pebbles. It has no real volume at the moment and can rightly be described as undiscovered. That can work both ways.

You can buy Lunch Money through Uniswap.

Lunch Money replaces last week’s addition of Libertas. We will tell you the full story of our fall out with the CEO at Libertas in Monday’s Moonshot Monday. This made us question their own credibility hence their banishment from our list.

You can view the Micro Cap Watch List [here](https://cryptoquestion.tech/micro-cap-watch-list/)

**Other goings on**

Listen to this week’s Moonshot Monday [here](https://cryptoquestion.tech/weekly-podcast/) where we look at 7 micro cap projects with potential focusing on our three favorites.

**Article**

If you are interested at all in the world outside micro caps you can read our latest article [Solana vs Cardano ](https://cryptoquestion.tech/report-solana-vs-cardano/)where we provide an assessment of each project together with a price target. The article caused quite a stir from a few of the die hard Cardano fans. We like causing stirs!

**Weekly Staking and Yield Farming Review**

You can view this week’s staking review [here](https://cryptoquestion.tech/staking-and-yield-farming-weekly-review/). We provide an analysis of the top APRs from leading platforms.

That is it for this week.

**This report does not constitute financial advice or a recommendation to buy in any way. Always do your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Investing in cryptocurrencies is a high risk, and you could lose 100% of your investment.**

Until Monday!

ADA,Altcoin,Plethori - Meaningfully Bridging DeFi with Institutional Finance via ETF's -- Micro-cap with platform release THIS QUARTER 10x short/ 100x medium term,"Some of the biggest things keeping institutional and ""normie"" finance largely away from DeFi and focused on large cap coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum are:

* A steep learning curve
* Overwhelming amount of projects and therefore research
* High risk

In traditional finance, these problems are mitigated using ETF's, exchange trade funds. ETF's are a group of assets in a single purchasable share which represents stocks related to specific industries, or bundles designed to minimize risk and hedge different stocks possible failing unexpectedly.

Purchasing an ETF allows you to buy into industries, not just companies, by purchasing a hand picked and weighted basket of goods which is unlikely to produce a loss if the whole industry takes off, but a single company or stock within it fails unexpectedly.

What Plethori brings to DeFi is democratized ETF's for crypto currency assets on Ethereum and PolkaDot blockchain, including wrapped assets such as Bitcoin, and down the road integration of Cardano (when they implement smart contracts).

This means that anyone can now create and share ETF's, earning a percentage of the trading fees associated with that ETF. Savvy investors can let their followers, friends, family invest in all the same things they do with the purchase of a single asset at any price point desired. Top ETF's earn spots on the leaderboard as well as NFT's with special perks to the owners.

Investors with huge capital can invest broadly in new innovations in crypto, like layer 2 scaling, DEXes, smart contracts, by purchasing an ETF with all the relevant cryptos, rather than having to do significant research and manual portfolio balancing and diversification.

This means too that retail investors uneducated in crypto can stop fomo'ing into high risk meme stocks like Doge where they could easily lose money, and instead purchase low risk ETF's which will grow with the entire space. They also plan to build in a fiat gateway to further simplify the path from cash to smart crypto investing.

Plethori brings one of the most powerful tools of traditional finance to DeFi in a way that attracts expert crypto investors, traditional finance, and people completely new to the space. The protocol is built on PolkaDot and utilizes layer 2 so users will not experience the expensive and slow transaction times which plagues so much of DeFi.

The team is fully doxxed, LP is locked, presale locked. DYOR.

Tokenomics:

Current Circulating Supply: 18.4 million

Total Supply: 100 million (slowly released over the next year at 10% each month)

Staking: 40% APY

ADA,Altcoin,The CryptoQuestion November Bulletin - Important news roundup and free crypto resources for your listening and viewing pleasure,"**About us: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

**Market Overview**

The crypto market continues its new bull run, which re-commenced in July, hitting a new high of $2.7 trillion. Both Bitcoin and Ether also reached all time highs in October. Binance Coin, Tether and Cardano make up the top five by market cap. The Fear and Greed index currently sits at ‘Greed’, which compares to last week’s ‘Extreme Greed’ and last month’s neutral.

**Trending**

**SEC Approves Bitcoin Futures ETF**

After years of false starts the crypto industry finally got its ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). The SEC approved the ProShare Bitcoin Strategy ETF. After two days on the NYSE ProShare’s ETF became the fastest fund ever to reach $1 billion in assets under management. Physically based bitcoin ETFs, where you invest directly in bitcoin, are still waiting approval, but it is a promising start.

**SEC Chairman claims U.S won’t ban crypto**

It came as a relief to the market when Gensler the Chairman of the SEC declared that the U.S would not ban crypto but would seek to better regulate it. Although the final decision would be up to Congress. That regulation is most likely to be focused on the stablecoin market to begin with.

**Walmart enters crypto**

Walmart shoppers can now buy bitcoin at 200 kiosks in its stores. The test is with Coinstar which offers bitcoin at more than 3,000 kiosks.

**Axie Infinity creator raises $152 million**

Axie Infinity is one of the most popular play-ro-earn games on the blockchain commanding a $38 billion valuation (fully diluted). An Investment in the creator rather than the tokens is a telling sign that the tokens do not represent good value. Avoid for now.

**Memecoin mania**

Shiba Inu, the memcoin named after another dog, saw its token rocket in value before falling back after a comment from Musk that he didn't own any. But that comment didn't stop its rise and it is now valued above Dogecoin at $38 billion. Of course that has reignited the search for the next Doge or Shiba, a search we won't be embarking on.

**Squid Games pump and dump**

A token inspired by the Netflix show Squid Games saw its price spiral upwards by 380,000% on its debut. That upwards momentum continued as the price hit $2,861. However the price came crashing down as the founders cashed out with a $12 million profit and left the ‘project’. That my friends is the danger of investing in memecoins and projects with no fundamentals.

**NFT mania**

Coinbase announced it was launching an NFT marketplace focusing initially on Ethereum based NFTs.

**The good and bad of Robinhood**

Robinhood’s announcement that it was launching a crypto wallet hit the share price of Coinbase particularly after they revealed they had already signed up 1 million people to the upcoming product. However Robinhood suffered its own set back a few days later when it reported its quarterly earnings. The main cause of concern was the fall off in crypto trading from $233 million in the previous quarter to $51 million in the current. The shares tanked.

**USDC finds itself under investigation**

One of the leading stable coins, number two behind Tether, was issued with a subpoena from the SEC back in July, only recently coming to light however. It was also disclosed that the investigation continues. USDC announced it was shifting its reserves to only cash and treasuries. It is expected that the SEC will oversee the stablecoin market in the short term, something which will no doubt send shivers up the spine of Tether.

**Tether’s house of cards**

Last month we reported that the SEC is investigating Tether. This month they were hit with a $42.5 million fine by the CFTC. It was also reported in a Bloomberg expose that billions of dollars of client money has been invested in risky crypto projects, something the team at Tether initially denied but was later confirmed by Celsius who benefited from an investment of $1 billion. This is a devastating revelation and is a sure sign that if there was ever a bank run investors would suffer massive losses.

**New York targets DeFi Lending**

Both Nexus and Celsius received cease and desist letters from the New York Attorney General. Nexus and Celsius are lending platforms targeting private investors.

**Finally...**

A new survey suggests 11.4% of adults around the world own crypto. Nigeria, Malaysia and Australia have the highest rate of adoption. Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Philippines, Mexico and the US make up the top 10.

ADA,Altcoin,IMAGINE GETTINGN ETHERIUM FOR $20 WELL MEET ZENON," Zenon Network is aiming to build a dApp platform (zApp, as  they say). The lightpaper is presenting a groundbreaking novel  consensus called “Network of Momentum”. The Network of  Momentum is a gossip protocol using three kind of nodes  (Pillars, Sentries & Sentinels) in order to shard the network  and maintain its metastability. A peer reviewed whitepaper  is scheduled to be released sometime in December of 2019.  Cardano, Algorand and Thundercore are among the only  projects that went through proper academic reviews of their  whitepaper(s). There are worse references and that’s it for the  tech.",4,2021-04-08 14:11:02,8
ADA,Altcoin,Enigma is the most promising blockchain project I've seen,"The problem? It's confusing to quickly understand what they are attempting to accomplish (e.g. Catalyst vs. Enigma protocol). After reading the whitepaper, all the blog posts, and watching videos with the team, I believe the Enigma protocol should be valued comparably to the other top legitimate projects today (ETH, Cardano, Stellar, NEO).

1) Team - The Enigma team is perhaps the most qualified team in crypto. MIT Media Lab has been at the forefront of blockchain since the beginning, and innovation in general. In addition to MIT pedigrees, they have real, tenured backgrounds in development and distributed systems - it truly amazes me how many projects have generated higher market cap with zero credibility in distributed systems (let alone non-development backgrounds...).

2) Protocol ambition - unless you do the research, it's easy to miss what they are trying to accomplish. The most recent blog post outlines potential real-world use cases in six large industries, each $50B+. To help understand, I've pulled out passages from select blog posts:

""This is an ambitious vision that rivals the scale of large projects like Ethereum and Filecoin while complementing their functionality. In addition to our data protocol, we are building products (such as Catalyst) that will democratize the tools for interacting with and consuming data.""

""[The Enigma protocol] aspires to complement a blockchain (of any kind) with an off-chain data network (essentially — a single, always-on decentralized database), in much the same way that payment networks (e.g., Raiden) offer better financial transactions scalability. Essential to the Enigma network is the ENG token

""We hope this explains the reasoning behind our naming. Enigma was, and still is the name given to the decentralized data marketplace protocol. It is also the name of the company behind it. Catalyst is the first application to encourage adoption of a decentralized protocol that we hope would one day hold the long-tail of data on the web. As the name suggests, Catalyst is meant to speed up the adoption of this protocol.""

""We are facing the opportunity to completely reshape dozens of industries, each with tens or hundreds of billions of dollars of unlockable value, if we can solve the two major issues of blockchains: scalability and privacy.""

3) A functioning product - Catalyst is the first product example and already available for use. Catalyst is only the beginning and I believe pales in comparison to broader Enigma protocol use cases, but it serves as a proof of concept and a proof point that the team is legitimate and can deliver. Many other larger market cap projects have nothing beyond a whitepaper.

4) Incredibly undervalued - a 30x return may sound high, but that would result in a ~$12B USD market cap today (less than Cardano / Stellar / Tron - honestly not unreasonable ignoring marketing / hype and based on project merit alone).

Decentralization is the future, but most crypto projects today are held up by irrational market exuberance alone and will ultimately fail. The Enigma protocol has the ability to become the backbone of our decentralized world.


Disclaimer: I have invested significantly in ENG at various times from $0.60 USD and most recently during this dip. I will continue to buy until this project is valued appropriately (greater than $10B USD at today's valuations - higher as the broader non-BTC market rises this year). I have no intention to sell until then.",22,2018-01-05 14:12:26,21
ADA,Altcoin,Best diversification strategy,"I'd like some advice on diversifying a crypto portfolio. Atm I have a position in about 30 coins. Projects that are all interesting to me one way or the other.

I was wondering, would it be more wise to have 30+ smaller positions in promising projects, including a couple of low cap high potential growth coins. (Like [MATIC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polygon), [ENJ](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/enjin-coin), [FSN](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/fusion), [SWAP](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/trustswap), [XTZ](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tezos), [SNX](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/synthetix-network-token))

Or would it be better to have a larger investment in 5-10 projects which are more established? (Like [ETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum), [ADA](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cardano), [VET](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/vechain), [LINK](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/chainlink), [THETA](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/theta-network))

ADA,Altcoin,General Altcoin strategy,"Hello All,

I am fairly new to the crypto world, yet I did already start digging deep into the different technologies in order to better plan out an investing strategy. Generally, i am not interested in daily tradings although I do have some questions in that respect too.

- What's your preferred Exchange platform? After extensively reading people's thoughts here at Reddit, I ended up creating a Coinbase account, now awaiting my deposit to be processed, so I can transfer money to GDAX, then purchase ETH or BTC and head over to Binance for alt coins. It does take time, so you potentially lose money as opposed to buying right away, but it should reduce fees altogether. Do you start off with a certain fiat sum, then just buy/sell on dips and try to grow it gradually, or you rather transfer money whenever you want to buy a particular coin, because most of you hodl.

- I remember Marc Cuban's advice that diversification is for idiots. As someone who has limited finances to invest in crypto, I still ponder whether he's right and I should focus on 1 or 2 coins, instead of a wide array of investments. I am considering Cardano, Ripple, Verge and Iota or simply 2 of these in larger quantity. I read people arguing about the approach to purchase cheap coins with unproven technologies, aiming for profit, as opposed to chunks of a well established one with somewhat predictable growth. Despite market caps and the abundance in circulation of the former, I still believe there's other criteria to define price, therefore holding larger amounts would be more worthwhile. Besides, all cryptos presently possess any value exclusively in reference to USD, JPY, EUR etc. Is it naive to believe they could outgrow this dependence and form value on their own?

Thanks in advance for all feedback!

______

NEW PREMIUM VERSION 2 RELEASED LAST NIGHT! You can now track the buys and sells of your wallet or ANY OTHER WALLET. Can you imagine how this will help you with tracking taxes, buying peaks and lows. This is an absolute game changer and you only need to hold $300 of liquidity in PooCoin. See below;

**[Poocoin](https://poocoin.app/tokens/0xb27adaffb9fea1801459a1a81b17218288c097cc)** -  Don’t let the shitty name fool you (this is not a shit coin) has emerged as arguably the best BSC / BEP-20 charting application. I bet you did not know this however, PooCoin is made by 1 person. That is right 1 person created PooCoin.  He is active daily in the [Telegram](https://t.me/poocointokenchat) and constantly coming out with new features. For instance just yesterday he added an option for you to track your buys and sells on any particular coin.  

_______

It’s not an application built by a multi-million dollar company with tons of scheming investors out for profit, it is built by one man and marketed by the community. People like you and me.  We can all agree Bitcoin isn’t the best at what it does, but there is no argument that it hit the scene first, it was popular, and it did what it was created to do. The same is true with PooCoin, it’s going to be the best and with you help it can! Because on top of a great Website the site also has it’s own coin,[ PooCoin](https://poocoin.app/poocoin) which is used to [gain premium features on the site \(check it out here\)](https://poocoin.app/premium)  It only has a paltry 2.5 million dollar market cap at the time of writing (Compare that to DexTools at over 70million) this coin is poised to breakout very soon.
helps folks track BSC (Binance Smart Chain) wallets and understand how individual coins are trading. Given how high-risk and volatile crypto markets are, this is an incredibly important function – and it hasn’t surprised me to see links to poocoin charts popping up all over the place.

**Tokenomics:** 


* 	Redistribution / deflationary mechanism. 
* 	8% fee charged for each transaction, 4% distributed to token holders 4% burned. 
* 	To date over 3.5 million coins have been burned! 
* 	Transaction fee + redistribution incentivizes hodlers over swing traders, YOU SIMPLY INCREASE YOUR TOKENS BY HOLDING THE COIN, and then the token burn deflates supply which creates upward pressure on the price over time. 
* 	No more than 100,000 can be traded in 1 transaction, meaning there’s a limit on huge whale buys / sells.


Dextools has rightly emerged as the leading analytics / charting app for Uniswap, with great charts and individual 
transaction data. BSC / Pancake have been lacking a similarly high-functioning, fast, reliable solution. Poocoin provides that solution – 


* 	Charts!! 
* 	Transaction tracking
* 	Wallet tracking
* 	Yield Farm tracking (Toilet feature) and more to come and driven by the community.


Check out the telegram to see how it really is a community-driven project, with users requesting features and the lead developer responding in real-time.  It’s still very early, this is a great buy. The initial supply was 10M POO, however total supply now is around 6.7 million. That’s a market cap of $2+M. Compare that to GoSwapp (BSC charting platform that people appear to be using significantly less than PooCoin, at least the last few weeks) @ $36M 
No presale and distribution of holders has grown less concentrated over time. PooCoin had no presale; it simply launched on [PancakeSwap](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xb27adaffb9fea1801459a1a81b17218288c097cc). If you’re buying in now you’re buying EARLY!I 

What about liquidity and volatility? Liquidity was a significant concern for me and many in the community for the past week or two. Currently, liquidity has been steadily climbing due to the rapidly increasing Premium Users that are jumping onboard. More liquidity generally means less volatility (i.e. a given buy / sell has less price impact), and it’s a generally a good thing for a coin’s legitimacy.

ADA,Altcoin,"Peer Review - #superlauncher - Safe Heaven, Hidden Gem?","
I am not a financial adviser and please DYOR.
So after the big arse correction I was looking for a coin that gave me a passive income as well as able to participate in IDOs.
Superlauncher has been a great project and has suppressed my expectations. The team have been on the ball at every stage. Just after I invested in LAUNCH the team rolled out their staking platform. This is at the forefront of what projects are doing, the EGG coin has a limited supply so it will become rare, and rare mean higher value. You are able to trade it, hold it and use it to gain more percentage/leverage in the participation’s of the IDOs. 
Come July V2 rollout will be completed, this will allow every holder to gain access to the IDOs with auto listing capabilities. In addition the project will have Cardano capabilities which I believe no other launch pad has. This is a complete and utter game changer, to be guaranteed a slot in IDO releases is something that hasn’t been done yet.
Superlauncher has a market cap of around 2 million and a max total supply of 12 million. Since I’ve been a holder I’ve seen this coin become stable and has even held its own again BTC falling. For me this is a no brainier. Superlauncher at present is super undervalued and I believe it will fly once it is more known about.
Around half of the holders have already staked their coins so in terms of stability moving forward the project is super prepared for any outcome.
All I can say is thank you to the team for giving light in these red days. 
Well done! Complete Gem!

ADA,Altcoin,AIX - very promising if potential is realized. Opinions?,"What are people's thoughts on AIX here? Would like some feedback before looking into making any moves. This one seems very promising and solid, yet is under the radar in the crypto-world. If potential is realized than huge returns could be gained by investing now. It's basically bringing insurance to IoT devices and they have already have a product out. Seeing cryptos like cardano and Tron - who may also have a great idea, but nothing other than a whitepaper and long winded roadmap surprises me here. Not to mention, unlike them AIX has an extremely low circulating supply, so the price should be quite big if it gets popular. It's on Kucoin atm, should it reach binance I can see this thing going through the roof for those who get involved now. It's listed on cmc also, but because market cap isn't calculated, it's missing from top 100-200. I'm not shilling it - after all I've not even put my money on it. I'd really like to know what redditors think because I've browsed around and listened to some opinions on here and 70ish % of the time they actually pay off. Planning to put around 20% of my portfolio into a coin that's not yet took off. ",31,2018-01-13 08:07:25,12
ADA,Altcoin,Ethereum = Fedcoin (A Branch of the Fed Funded and Built Cryptos from The Beginning),"**Still wrapping my head around this, but this is what a certain article is trying to convey:**
***  
***
    
A ""Fedcoin"" created by the government would surely fail, according to this article (linked at bottom, ref. 1), however... 
***    
***    
**...The fed already controls Ethereum and a bunch of other cryptos.** 
    
***
***
Why would that matter? The NSA and CIA have already been caught trying to create backdoors into our computers and OS's (ie. Windows, Linux). (See references 4 and 5). They could attempt to do the same with blockchain technology, implemented into a crypto that becomes a standard within a few years, like Ethereum or Cardano, for example (ref. 6). The fed is actually funding crypto development (see below), meaning they could influence whether some form of spyware could be implemented into the blockchain. 
***

Also, we must note that **a cryptocurrency that is transparent (public ledger) is great for the government, because they can track your every transaction, and possibly move.** If cash becomes obsolete (the assumed goal of fedcoin), we will have much less control and freedom in the way we can spend money. No more ""tax-free"" cash transactions. **Some countries, like Italy and Spain, have already banned cash transactions above 1000 euros (~$1200).** (ref. 11 and 12). 
***

They could also potentially program purchase restrictions as a smart contract (ie. didn't pay your taxes? You can't buy 'luxury' goods like movie tickets, you can only buy food and pay rent. Too fat? Can't buy sugar. Not a police officer? Can't buy ammo... transaction rejected for this Ethereum address... etc).
***

China and Russia can ban cryptos (communist harsh world approach) but the US is trickier. Just like controlling hearts and minds with media (alot more effective than force), the US has a more efficient plan. They're just investing into development of cryptos. That way they don't need to make a fedcoin, they will have influence over existing coins. The cryptos we love and stand behind WILL BE the fedcoins.
***


>""The Federal Reserve already is the primary investor of basically every cryptocurrency and blockchain project in existence. While in a previous article I dug into their investment arm the Digital Currency Group and how they heavily funded operations like Coinbase, Coindesk, Kraken, Ripple, I’ve since discovered the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. (DTCC): an open member of the Federal Reserve. They are responsible for the remaining spectrum of the blockchain, including Ethereum.""
***


>**""There will be no FEDcoin, however there will be an attempted global central bank currency that no one realizes is centralized until it is too late.""**
***
***

**Note:** 
I hope I'm terribly wrong about this. I'm both all-in into cryptos, and hate the thought of more government control. But I also have heard people talking about a ""one-world currency"" conspiracy for a long time, and if it would be true, this theory is not far fetched at all.
***

If anyone has any ideas to prove this wrong, or on how to stop it from becoming true, please do post. 
***

The article in in ref. 10 suggests the best response will be ""a better technology that sprints forward and leaves those who wish to ‘tame’ it coughing on its dust."", however how would we know that the cryptocurrency(ies) we come to adopt are 100% safe?
***
***



**TLDR:** 
The Fed is funding cryptos so they can control them and also potentially install / program spyware into the blockchain. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corp (DTCC) is an open member of the federal reserve, as is the Digital Currency Group (DCG). Through these entities the Federal Reserve has funded and built the cryptocurrency market. Better technology can prevent this, but how would we know if our favorite crypto is 100% safe?

ADA,Altcoin,"""Cheap"" coins are not as cheap as they seem","We've just added feature to our comparison tool. You can compare coins by their levels of supply (either total or circulating). We normalise the price of the coin by removing unit bias. This feature gives you a good view of the coins that look ""cheap"" but are probably not as cheap as they seem.

E.g: We assume that ADA had the same circulating supply as BTC, and use the formula (ADA Supply / BTC supply * ADA Price) to remove unit bias. Under these conditions, ADA price would be $ 1,020. Matching by total supply, ADA price = $ 1,419

It's definitely not as cheap as it seemed. See more at: http://matchcoins.info/?c1=bitcoin&c2=cardano

ADA,Altcoin,"Experiment - Top 10 Crypto ""Index Fund"" 2018 - (Month Two Recap - down 32%)","tl;dr/w - it's not going well

**The experiment:** Instead of hypothetically tracking cryptos throughout the year, I made an actual $1000 investment, $100 in each of the Top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap as of the 1st of January 2018. I'm trying to keep it simple and accessible for beginners, a type of homemade Index Fund (and hopefully a bit of a proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market) for those looking to get into cryptos but maybe not quite ready to jump in yet.

**The Rules:** Buy $100 of each the Top 10 cryptocurrencies as of January 1st, 2018. Run the experiment 365 days. Hold only. No selling. No trading.

**Month two (February) update:**
*February Winners* - **Litecoin**, easily - up 42% in the month of February. Litecoin was followed by **Bitcoin**, up about 20%. *February Losers* - **NEM** wins first loser, cut nearly in half, down -45% followed by **Cardano** and **Stellar Lumens** both down about -32% in February. 

**Overall update - Ethererum in the lead, NEM flailing** Since the beginning of the year, only one of the Top Ten cryptocurrencies is in the green: **Ethereum**, up a total of about 20%. Worst performer so far this year? **NEM**, down a whopping 58%. 

**Bitcoin dominance:** Up to nearly 42%, a massive move from the end of January, when it held only 33% market dominance. 

**Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:** Shrunk further from 485B at the end of January to 462B currently (down about 5%). 

**Overall return on investment from January 1st, 2018:** ***$1000 initial investment is now worth about $680, a -32% decrease.*** 

**Implications:** Just look at the winners for the month and for the year so far: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin.** The big three. With the overall market cap not shifting much over February (down 5%) there doesn't appear to be much new money coming into crypto. Instead, investors already in the space are shifting from altcoins to cryptos they perceive as less risky, namely **BTC, ETH, and LTC**. 

It also appears that just ***focusing on the Top Ten may not be a winning strategy*** in 2018 as the Top Ten are down -32% so far when the overall crypto market is down only -19%. Only! 

Another one of the underlying questions for the experiment is: considering how much growth there was in 2017, are cryptos still good place to put your money in 2018 compared to other investments? To have something common to compare the cryptosphere to, I will also be tracking the S&P 500. The stock market had a pretty rough February as well and the S&P is down quite a bit for the month. And since the beginning of the year, January the S&P 500 has only seen a 1% increase. 

**Conclusion:** If the experiment ended today, the story would be that 2017 boat had sailed and that crypto was a horrible investment decision in 2018. In fairness, the stock market hasn't been much fun either so far this year. With 20/20 hindsight, if re-given the choice to invest the initial $1k in the Top Ten cryptos and being down -32% or being up 1% (S&P 500) I'd probably pick: neither. I would have been better off in a high interest savings account! That said, a year is a long time. It does feel like crypto has bottomed out and the optimists are gearing up for a bull run. I'm committed to sticking it out so stay tuned.

ADA,Altcoin,"Most talked about and upvoted cryptos and altcoins on reddit, week ending 2018-02-03","What a roller coaster it’s been! Glad January is over.

I wanted to continue sharing something with this community that seems to be helpful, but please keep giving me feedback! 

I wrote a program that scrapes reddit posts from r/cryptocurrency and r/altcoin, and calculates how much certain cryptocurrencies are mentioned, to help give an early indication of the next potential 10x crypto. Ok fine 10x is _highly_ optimistic, but understanding crowd sentiment has proven to be a good place to start for more research. 

Here are some of the numbers for this week (if you prefer to follow along via email, [you can do so here](https://cryptomintclub.com)).

**Note**: *always* do your own research. Not all cryptos with a lot of mentions are being talked about good/positive reasons (e.g. BitConnect). Keep reading for info on getting a list of all recent posts so you can browse the headlines and gauge sentiment.

**RECENTLY TRENDING CRYPTOS**


**Highlights:**

1. **Nano** (formerly known as Raiblocks) saw a lot more discussion about it this week. Raiblocks rebranded to Nano, and got listed on Binance.

2. **OriginTrail** and **Blockport** were some lower market cap coins that have appeared on the top talked about cryptos list this week.

3. The community talked less about **BitConnect** and **VeChain** last week compared to the week before, as BitConnect being a scam is common knowledge now, and VeChain takes a small breather from its recent flurry of news.

ADA,Altcoin,Are there prophets amongst us?,"Dear Dedicated Investors,

Sorry if this been asked before, maybe I'm searching for the wrong thing, but how do people know that there's going to be a surge for ""insert profitable coin here""? I see these 300-1000% surges in a different coin every day on coinmarketcap. Is there a particular resource that people use to educate themselves before an altcoin skyrockets or are people just dedicated to a certain coin and follow every bit of news that comes out about it? Thanks in advance!

Sincerely, 
A less-than-successful, impatient n00b (gotta fix that)

P.S. I  am committed to Cardano and Salt",4,2017-12-11 20:58:04,10
ADA,Altcoin,Data from the top 20 fastest growing communities in crypto over the last month,"Hey everyone, for the past couple months I have been working on a project called [Coinmunity](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinmunity-bitcoin-altcoin-app/id1322869245?mt=8). Coinmunity is an app that focuses on the growth of crypto communities, which in the market right now, has so much effect in driving price changes. Each day it tracks which coins have the combined highest % of growth in their Twitter and Reddit communities combined.

&nbsp;

Today, Coinmunity has now been live for one month, so I thought I would share what patterns I have personally picked out, having worked on the data, and observing the rankings during development and while live.

&nbsp;

What I have noticed is that you will see certain coins start to creep up higher and higher into the top 10 or 15 communities consistently before a price increase. The best example is TRX. You can see from this reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7k2c4g/congrats_rtronix_you_were_the_top_growing/) that I made 27 days ago, that /r/Tron had the top community while it was still at $.01 ( and it continues to consistently be in top 10 even now.) I think most of us can agree TRX has some big issues, but the point is that it’s very important to know which coins have the most eyes on them; because when people are watching a coin, they’ll usually buy it.

&nbsp;

**Here are the 20 coins with the most growth in their communities in the last 30 days:**

[#1 TRX](/r/Tronix) -  **Price Change:** +2664.018%, **Total Social Change:**+3904.851%

[#2 VEN](/r/Vechain) - **Price Change:** +709.507%, **Total Social Change:**+974.497%

[#3 XVG](/r/VergeCurrency) - **Price Change:** +2005.76%, **Total Social Change:**+925.614%

[#4 ADA](/r/Cardano) - **Price Change:** +467.414%, **Total Social Change:**+714.406%

[#5 FUN](/r/FunFairTech) - **Price Change:** +366.608%, **Total Social Change:**+611.430%

[#6 REQ](/r/RequestNetwork) - **Price Change:** +646.897%, **Total Social Change:**+607.782%

[#7 BNB](/r/Binance) - **Price Change:** +546.153%, **Total Social Change:**+ 558.920%

[#8 SUB](/r/SubstratumNetwork) - **Price Change:** +619.376%, **Total Social Change:**+501.659%

[#9 XLM](/r/Stellar) - **Price Change:** +249.216%, **Total Social Change:**+501.642%

[#10 ARN](/r/AeronAero) - **Price Change:** +1020.204%, **Total Social Change:**+469.129%

[#11 ENG](/r/EnigmaCatalyst) - **Price Change:** +1162.809%, **Total Social Change:**+427.344%

[#12 MANA](/r/Dencentraland) - **Price Change:** +236.856%, **Total Social Change:**+393.404%

[#13 XRP](/r/Ripple) - **Price Change:** +812.067%, **Total Social Change:**+389.193%

[#14 ETN](/r/Electroneum) - **Price Change:** +60.470%, **Total Social Change:**+366.755%

[#15 QSP](/r/Quantstamp) - **Price Change:** +518.553%, **Total Social Change:**+346.401%

[#16 SALT](/r/SaltTrader) - **Price Change:** +76.836%, **Total Social Change:**+331.701%

[#17 AST](/r/AirSwap) **Price Change:** +561.384%, **Total Social Change:**+272.433%

[#18 THC](/r/TheHempCoin) - **Price Change:** +711.952%, **Total Social Change:**+265.797%

[#19 NULS](/r/NulsService) - **Price Change:** +587.179%, **Total Social Change:**+234.036%

[#20 QASH](/r/LiquidQash) - **Price Change:** +104.2105%, **Total Social Change:**+208.4238%

*Total social change => reddit and twitter growth

&nbsp;

It probably wouldn’t be the best decision to buy a coin based off just community growth, so Coinmunity pulls each coin’s full subreddit to make it easy to quickly research the coin and see if there is any upcoming big news. 

&nbsp;

**Some upcoming features that we think will add value:**

* Google trends

* Marketcap and volume rankings

* Track personal investments

&nbsp;

If you have an android, the app is currently in development, but I have made a mobile friendly web app that is available at https://coinmunity.co! I will announce on the Coinmunity [twitter](https://twitter.com/coinmunityapp) when it is completed.

&nbsp;

As Coinmunity continues to grow, I will start to collect more and more data on social activity surrounding these coins, such as retweets,comments, upvotes, etc. One relationship that I am looking forward to explore is the amount of exchanges a coin is available on vs social growth vs price growth. I think there is a sweet-spot before a coin is widely enough available to experience huge price jumps, where it would be the best time to buy a coin. If this is something you guys are interested in please let me know and I will continue to post each month about further discoveries from the data!

ADA,Altcoin,My alt coin cherry picking,"I've been involved in Bitcoin since 2013 and I see Bitcoin dead. In my opinion there's only one coin that is going to dominate the market in the long run and might not be Bitcoin. Altcoins are a terrific speculation if you missed the Bitcoin boat. These are my picks.


Low market cap, high potential:

* **Phore** phore.io 

* **Vericoin**

* **Verium**


The moderate market cap:

* **PIVX**

* **VERTCOIN**, the next Litecoin 

* **VERGE**

* **DOGE**, I just happen to have some but it's going to the moon so I cannot sell.

* **ARK**


The ones yet to be released:

* **Hashgraph**, This is an alternative to the blockchain and will literally change the landscape. Watch this amazing video: https://www.youtube.com/feed/history



Possible buy:
* **Cardano**. I like it but it's expensive


I bought around 2 BTC.


What do you guys think? Any diamond I might be missing?",2,2017-12-18 21:19:57,9
ADA,Altcoin,A Guide To ICO investing Bitcoin Millions: Is It Too Late For You?,"You've been probably reading the news about all those kids who manage to become filthy rich simply by investing in Bitcoin in 2013.

News like these usually make me feel mad because I missed the chance to buy Bitcoin when one of my friends told me that I should invest in Bitcoin back in 2014. 

Now the Bitcoin seems more like a gold mine rush because everybody thinks that he would be able to make millions easily. 

If you are like one of those people who want to make a quick buck on cryptocurrency, I advise you stop. You lost the game here. There's no easy money to be made on the crypto market anymore.

Here's Why Making Money On Cryptocurrency Will Become Harder In 2018

The market is oversaturated with cryptocurrency traders. There're people who are going to take your money because you simply don't know the game good enough.

Right now the whole market cap is crushing and in order to make profits, you need to be really smart.

Let's say you want to buy Cardano at its current price of $0,45 per coin. You see the graph and you notice that Cardano used to cost $0.77 a few weeks ago, and you are like maybe Cardano will go up again, and you buy Cardano. 

Who sold you the coin?

Is it the exchange itself? Is it Binance who sold you the coin?

The answer is no!

You bought the coin from people who already were holding the coin. They got the coin before the coin hit the exchange. They bought it dirt cheap on ICO presale level and they sold it to you 20x or even 30x the ICO price. 

If you know some good coins that are already listed on coinmarketcap.com Stop there! It is usually too late to acquire them because somebody both them a few years ago. Usually, those are the people who joined the ICO presales or the team members of the blockchain project.

Cryptocurrency market is very dynamic and people got hyped easily. So what should you do instead if you want to still benefit from the cryptocurrency market?

This what I am also doing...

Be the one who buys the coin first!

Go online and start researching cryptocurrency projects that are up to launch an ICO and start following their social media. There are few major important things that I am looking for:

Factor #1 The Main Lesson From A Coin That Cost Less Than $1 in 2015 And Reached $1,389 In Less Than 3 years! 

Every cryptocurrency project needs a strong team of developers. They'll be the one who would create the project. Also, I'm trying to invest my ETH into projects that have young teams. Many of the successful crypto projects have very young teams. 

For example, the founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin started the project when he was in his early twenties. The cost of Etherium hit $1,389 at its peak, and back in 2015, an Ethereum cost less than $1.

Is there a chance to found the next Vitalik Buterin? Just look for a young enthusiastic team.

Factor #2 Good Marketing And Big Idea

Whenever I invest in a project I aim to go with the idea that is practical. I don't invest in projects that I don't understand. I will visit the website and the social media to see if the team has good marketing. If I like the website and the idea I would go to the Telegram channel of the project.

You can learn a lot just by visiting a Telegram chat. I would ask a few questions to see if the team is responding. I used to think that the size of the Telegram group would matter, but there are a lot of ways to invite fake bots to a Telegram chat. So I would stay away from a group that has way too many unresponsive chat visitors.

Factor #3 ICO That Is Going To Make You Money vs ICO That Is Trying To Steal Your Hard-Earned Money

I do internet marketing for 4 years now. Whenever I go to a blockchain website I notice that a big majority of the projects don't have a long-term vision.

They are all about raising money with the ICO. I am just curious what happens next? So, I usually read the whitepaper, try to find out if they have set a road map. Usually, they have that stated on the website under a ""Road Map"".

So, I look for projects that have a long-term vision. It is very hard to see ROI in less than two years. I think this is the reasonable cycle.

ICO Projects You Should Consider

I am not a financial advisor. However, I did a great deal of thinking and researching ICOs. I am going share a list the top 3 ICOs that I personally invested in and I intend to invest in once the ICO is out for a presale.

1. Rentberry

I invested in Rentberry earlier this year. They already had a solid base of customers and they're building a decentralized home rental platform. Based in the USA, the team is supercool. They raised 30M, unfortunately if you want to invest now the project ICO project is already closed.

2. CrowdMachine

CrowdMachine has a very good idea. Their project aims to develop a system that requires no coding, enabling anyone to create decentralized apps and smart contracts without limitation. So basically, with CrowdMachine everybody will be able to create a blockchain without knowing how to code. This ICO start early April.

3. Cryptopus

Cryptopus might be a long shot. However, back in 2013 Etherium was a very long shot as well. This Russian ICO develops a blockchain brokerage marketplace. I personally know the team because once I stumble upon the project, I wanted to be a part of it, and I joined as an advisor. 

In Conclusion:

If you are looking for a coin that has a huge potential you might want to take a look at Cryptopus and CrowdMachine. 

CrowdMachine has a BIG idea and might change the blockchain game forever. ICO is out soon so definitely worth following.

Cryptopus has a very cool young team and amazing advisors on the board. ICO is currently ON! Could Cryptopus be the next Ethereum? 

We are about to see!

ADA,Altcoin,Is there anything on the market similar to Ethereum?,"I'm still doing my research and understand this world before I invest. I understand that Ethereum is a Blockchain platform, as opposed to just a strict crypto currency (although it does have a currency, ether). Are there any other competing companies yet?",1,2017-12-29 15:40:07,7
ADA,Altcoin,Best Altcoins 2018,"HI Everyone, these are my altcoins for 2018. Curious on people's opinions:

CND Cindicator
TRX Tron
XLM Stellar Lumens
BRD Bread
ADA Cardano
IOTA MIOTA
SUB Substratum
XRP Ripple
BQX Ethos
AION AION

Question is which types of blockchain companies have the most upside for 2018. I am guessing companies that help make cryptocurrencies accessible to the general public ETHOS, BRD. Curious on people's thoughts.",4,2018-01-04 10:23:16,6
ADA,Altcoin,Where do you keep your altcoins for long term holding?,"I have tons of coins tbh. Bitcoin,  etherum, ripple, verge, cardano, stellar, simple token, electroneum, ember coin, reddcoin, tron, dent, po.et, and dentacoin. I have a nano s ledger but I know it probably only holds 3 or 4 of those. Can anybody help me? Most of my mains are on coinbase but my altcoins are just sitting on exchanges. Even with the 2 factor authentication It doesn't feel that safe just leaving stuff on the exchange. If anybody could help would appreciate it greatly just trying to keep my investments safe.",4,2017-12-28 17:29:58,6

ADA,Altcoin,Need opinions on this matter,"Okay guys heres the deal. Im a uni student doin my last year, no way of obtaining more money atm to put in crypto. Next year I start work. Alts will be gaining momentum soon. I feel awareness is growing and next year all prices of alts will rise. I need to make sure I choose wisely. Currently I sit on the fence with 23 coins. Yes 23 , ridiculous I know. The amount I put in each coin varies. Minimum amount in a coin is around 50$. Now I believe more in vtc nav substratum and lisk. Im happy with the amounts ive put in those coins. However I feel the need to buy coins which are under 2$(i bought lisk over 2$). Due to lower market cap , going on new exchanges having new wallets increase their prices , they perhaps are going under the radar and believing my returns will rise faster than some of my other alts. I do own some walton omg which I feel will grow but simply not at a rate of other coins eg substratum/ardor/lumens. I also have some ltc eth xmr neo and yes they will grow but rate of return is what im concerned with , abit hesitant to sell off bigger market caps as smaller alts can easily crumble. Any opinions? I know the answer seems like risk v returns. Though keen to know your thoughts/advice/past experiences.",9,2017-11-11 17:36:01,5

I am wondering what coins are good to invest in right now and what I need to do to buy them.",2,2017-12-18 19:45:19,5

ADA,Altcoin,Converting to BTC,"Hi All. I apologize up front if this is the wrong sub for this question. I wanted to know at which point in time, if at all, do you convert your alts to BTC? I hodl 6 or so coins total but I'm noticing that the total value is getting me closer to having another full BTC. What is general practice? I'm not into my alts for a lot of fiat but they have done well recently. Just trying to game plan. If it matters the alts I own are Ripple, Litecoin, Tronix, Iota, Cardano.",3,2018-01-05 19:47:06,2
ADA,Altcoin,Why did so many alts spike so much in December? Everything up 100s of percent?!?,"I'm looking at coinmarketcap and I see so many currencies that all just had enormous spikes all at the same time.   Ripple, RaiBlocks, Ven, Cardano, Iota..   every one of them gained at least 400%.  XRB and ADA went up like 30x!  If you pick any random currency in the top 50 or so, it's pretty much the same.

What is going on?  I recently got it, but after the big run up, but I'm getting cold feet looking at these graphs.  Currencies flat or slightly increasing for months and then they all just spike straight up at the exact same time?  Something feels fishy.  Can anyone explain this rationally?

ADA,Altcoin,"losing my money in crypto, what to do","losing my money in crypto and it is stressing me out. I put a decent chunk of my savings into alt coins, cardano, trx, and ethos.

ADA,Altcoin,Software wallets make me frustrated,"Today I tried out Ethereum Geth, IOTA Light Wallet and Daedalus for Cardano. Must say that it was not a pleasant user experience. 
*these are my experiences and people might have other opinions

Geth was a pain in a certain hole. It lacks documentation and it seems you'll need to be an expert to get it running. My intention was to just set up a wallet and just that. But I don't think that is what the software wanted. I followed some steps to get Geth started. I specified ""--fast --cache=512""  to sync the blockchain to a minimum. But nooooo, it has now synced 40GB and my 120GB M.2 storage is getting close to collapse. Theres no option to change the storage directory for this, though one can probably poke around in the code.... Should it exist a constant that defines this directory? i got to make my wallet/address but I can't really use it right? Because then I have to fully sync...(can probably upload it to an online wallet. But I find that really risky).

Then theres IOTA. Nice interface, but what the hell is a seed(I now know what seed is). Uppercase and only the number 9. It was eazy enough to generate this but the program could and should have generated this for the user. (Would make seeds more secure. Though the implimentation of the algorithme would need to be good). Doesn't seem to sync the blockchain. It haven't taken up much space. That is what I want! But is the seed all I need? Where's my keys and password? Can I start generate seeds then...

Then theres Daedalus for Cardano. Nice GUI, but then there's all this syncing again. Had to stop it! I even selected the light version. God Dammit! Can't I have nice things. 

After all frustration I tried Exodus, thinking I could import my keys and address generated from the other wallets. But what...no. I got new addresses. Sure, okay, I can do this. I was thinking this could work and I should immidietly do a backup of address and keys. But wait..There's no option for that. What! Can't I use these addresses outside Exodus? 

Here's my wish list for crypto developers:
1. Set syncing limits  So that the blockchain can't take over the available space.
2. Make it possible to specify storage directory. I understand using appdata makes it really eazy...
3. Eazy access to account address and keys for backup.
4. Eazy import of existing account address and keys.
5. Make a clean direct documentation and guide.

Would be nice to get a little discussion around this. Does enyone experience the same hassle as I do? ",2,2017-12-23 16:14:39,1
ADA,Altcoin,Strategy : How do you diversificate your portfolio ?,"Hello guys,

Like many others at the moment, I'm relatively new in the crypto game. I've doubled my investment last month, but I'm asking my self to many questions to repeat this performance this month.

My principal struggle is to know **how many coins I should invest in to optimize my growth**. So far I've been mostly investing in 4 coins (Cardano, Raiblocks, iExec and IOTA), with 1000% growth on 2 of them, but I feel interest for other coins (Ethos, Vechain, Request Network..). 

So, please, feel free to share how you manage your portfolio diversification; what is, in your opinion, the best strategy to adopt in order to balance risk and growth, and also, the trigger that makes you invest in a specific coin !

Thanks !

ADA,Altcoin,"EXPERIMENT - Top 10 Crypto ""Index Fund"" 2018 - (Month Three/Q1 Recap - down 63%)","[Steemit summary here](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@starthere/experiment-top-10-crypto-index-fund-2018-month-three-q1-recap-down-63) (with screencap of tracker)

&nbsp;

tl;dr - from bad to worse 

&nbsp;

**The experiment:** Instead of hypothetically tracking cryptos throughout the year, I made an actual $1000 investment, $100 in each of the Top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap as of the 1st of January 2018. I'm trying to keep it simple and accessible for beginners, a type of homemade Index Fund* for those looking to get into cryptos but maybe not quite ready to jump in yet.
(*without weighting and rebalancing it's not a true Index Fund - but hopefully still helpful as a sort of a proxy for the entire market).

&nbsp;


**The Rules:** Buy $100 of each the Top 10 cryptocurrencies as of January 1st, 2018. Run the experiment 365 days. Hold only. No selling. No trading. Report monthly.

&nbsp;

**Month three (March) update:**


Nothing but red.

*March Winners* - None. The top two performers in March lost ""only"" close to 1/3 of their value. **Stellar** has dropped the least (-34%) followed by **Bitcoin** (-38%). **Stellar** managed to climb up a position in the rankings going from #8 to #7 and **IOTA** went from #11 to #10. All others either maintained their position or dropped in ranking.

*March Losers* - Everyone. **Ethereum** wins first loser down more than half at -55% followed by **Dash** and **Cardano**, both down about -50% for the month.

&nbsp;

**Overall update/Q1 update - Stellar down the least while Cardano, Ripple, and NEM are getting crushed**

Since the beginning of the year not one of the Top Ten cryptocurrencies is in the green. **Stellar**, which has easily performed the best, is still down -34%. Interestingly, three of the most established cryptos (**BTC, ETH**, and **LTC**) come next - and all are down the same amount for the year (-46%).

Losers? **Cardano** (-78%) is leading the race to the bottom followed closely by **Ripple** and **NEM** both down about -76%. **Dash** and **NEM** have both lost their places in the Top Ten.

&nbsp;

**Bitcoin dominance:**

Bitcoin dominance continued to climb to new highs for 2018. At the end of March it stood at about 45.5%.

&nbsp;

**Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:**

The overall crypto market shed about 200B in March (that's a loss of about -43% for the month) and is down over fifty percent (-54% to be exact) from January 1st.

&nbsp;

**Overall return on investment from January 1st, 2018:**

My $1000 initial investment is now worth about $372, down about -63%.

&nbsp;

**Implications:**

**Stellar's** recent run places it squarely in the lead so far in 2018, but being down -34% is a bit of a hollow victory. After **Stellar**, the Big Three (**Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin**) continue to perform second ""best"" - all are down nearly 50% since the beginning of the year.

Money continues to flee the crypto space. The total market cap shrunk from 464B to 263B in March alone (-43%) and is down -54% from January 1st, 2018.

Focusing solely on holding the Top Ten continues to be a losing strategy. While the overall market is down -54% from January, the Top Ten are down -63% over the same period.

As I've explained in previous posts, I'm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to other popular investments options. So far the S&P 500 is down -1.2% for the year.

&nbsp;


**Conclusion:**

To say crypto had a rough first quarter of 2018 would be a massive understatement. While I (and many others) were hoping we reached bottom in February, that clearly has not been the case as another 200B was lost in March. While the stock market is down this year, a -1.2% loss (as measured by the S&P 500) is obviously much more palatable than being down -63% as I am so far in this experiment. Like last month, with perfect hindsight, the initial $1,000 would have been better placed in a high-yield savings account making 1.5% or so in interest.

&nbsp;

Many thanks for the moral support I've received for the experiment. A bleak picture so far but there are three more quarters to go - a lot can (and will) happen. I continue to be committed to seeing this process through and reporting along the way. I've been traveling a lot recently, so hope to find time to make my monthly update video sometime this week as well.

&nbsp;

Stay tuned for progress reports and wishing you all the best in your crypto adventures!",3,2018-04-04 05:05:56,0
ADA,Altcoin,"l""Cheap"" coins are not as cheap as they seem","We've just added feature to our comparison tool. You can compare coins by their levels of supply (either total or circulating). We normalise the price of the coin by removing unit bias. This feature gives you a good view of the coins that look ""cheap"" but are probably not as cheap as they seem.

E.g: We assume that ADA had the same circulating supply as BTC, and use the formula (ADA Supply / BTC supply * ADA Price) to remove unit bias. Under these conditions, ADA price would be $ 536. Matching by total supply, ADA price = $ 746

It's definitely not as cheap as it seemed. See more at: https://matchcoins.info/?c1=bitcoin&c2=cardano

I hope you'll find it useful. Any feedback is very welcome.",5,2018-02-05 13:19:46,0
ADA,Altcoin,(BLZ) Bluzelle - Simple rundown and analysis,"Bluzelle Investment Cheatsheet:

Token: (BLZ) Bluzelle

What is it?: Bluzelle combines the sharing economy with the token economy - renting individuals' computer storage space to earn tokens while dApp developers use tokens to have their dApp's data stored and managed.

ICO: $0.12 per token

SUPPLY: 165M Circulating

MCAP: 100M

Traditional Market Equivialnt: Oracle (200BN market cap)

Closest crypto competion: SiaCoin SC (700M market cap)

Team experience: Google, Microsoft, Disney, Ucla, Lufthansa, ZEROBLOCK.

Next big release: Minimum Viable Product April 18

History: Formed 2014, already served customers for markets in Smart Insurance, Cross Boarder Payments and KYC Shared Ledger. Partners include: Microsoft, BT, Ripple, Ethereum, Temenos, KPMG. 

Awards: Global Fintech 100, WEF Tech Pioneer 2017


!!UNIQUE INVESTMENT FACTORS!! The whitelist application period was cut short due to overwhelming demand. The ICO was sold with a tiny 0.6ETH Maximum Personal Cap.  This means that most were not able to buy the amount of Bluzelle they wanted, as the ICO sold out fast despite the max cap. 

This greatly reduces the potential for whale manipulation, the only way they can increase their stacks to attempt such a feat is to buy more BLZ on Binance. LOW RISK OF BEING DUMPED ON IN THE SHORT TERM!! Bonuses for private investors are locked and most of the remaining supply locked for 2-4years.

The tokens were unlocked today and immediately listed on Binance as their first exchange. I assume Binance doesn't just allow any coin/ico that pays a fee to list as they are under closer government scrutiny now so that is quite impressive. The last time I saw something similar was when ADA(Cardano) arrived seemingly out of nowhere and straight on to Bittrex at a time when nothing was being listed.

My personal expectation is for this project to reach a market cap of 200M without much issue. That would be roughly 2x the current value. That is being super conservative and I anticipate it at least moving close to the value of Sia which would be roughly 10x the current value.

ADA,Altcoin,ENG and QSP,"I picked ADA cardano as a good investment at around 0.03 cents and like a stupid idiot sold it when it went up to around 15 cents thinking I have done well. Since then I have made a few other stupid mistakes but have consistently been picking some nice winners such as Verge (although I am it a great fan of it). Now I am holding on to just two key coins for dear life and these are ENG and QSP. I do have a few other interesting ones in my kitty such as EtherLEND and some ICO based coins as well but ENG and QSP are my big favourites and I think both have a great future similar to ADA Cardano.

ADA,Altcoin,Buy and Hold 100 Cryptocurrencies for 5 Years - Week 7 - $1726 USD gained,"It’s the 7th week since the experiment started and I’m still here! 🙂 The more time I spend checking the experiment and the more I realize how crazy and unstable It’s going to be.

In these past weeks a lot happened,from the South Korean ban, The Re-ban from China, CME but also some good news, as the long waited Lighintg Network, which allows Bitcoin to be transferred in a few seconds and with very low fees.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is at the moment $11,298.30 USD.  and the dominance is of 34.5%, a little improvement compared to the previous weeks.

The unrealized gain of the experiment is $1,726.46 USD or 0.15 BTC.
Only 11 Cryptocurrencies are in minus since the beginning of the experiment and 3 of them have a gain of over 1000%.

With an overall gain of 172.6 %, the 100 cryptocurrencies together (CryptoETF100) performed better than 72 cryptos from the ones I have.

Let’s talk about our Top5 cryptocurrencies.

Tron (TRX) is for the 4th week in a row the best gainer. Six weeks ago I bought 2500 TRX with $10.04.  2500 TRX are worth now $209.22, a gain of 1984.58 %

TRX just announced a new cooperation with Spacety and a few days ago it was listed on Bitfinex, one of the biggest exchange around. Justin Sun, also gave hints on a new exchange, will it be Kucoin?

Vechain (VEN) has been doing wonders, there is so much going on that it’s impossible to keep up! Just to mention afew, Breyer Capital has agreed to support VeChain through an official advisory role. They just announced a new cooperation with DNV GL and also with Sentinel Chain. When I bought it 7 weeks ago, I got with $10.11 USD , 18 (VEN), at the time the price was of $ 0.56 , right now the price is $7.27, so the 18 VEN is now worth $131.03  a major gain of 1195.52 %.

Verge (XVG) keeps up being on the 3rd position with an overall gain of 1008.82 % . It successfully hard forked and stealth tx’s are now being processed.

0x Protocol (ZRX) is now in the 4th position, what looked like momentum last week was only the beginning of a big rise. With the recent hack to the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, where it lost 523 mln NEM coins, approximately $534 mln. It only made clear to all of us the importance to have a decentralized exchange. Will 0x be the answer?

Lastly, on the 5th position, we have Cardano (ADA), the overall gain is of 519.78 %, was this rise given by the fact that Binance finally fixed the withdrawal issues?

Top 5 cryptocurrencies so far :

Tron (TRX)  +1563.45 % , from $10.04 to $166.95
VeChain (VEN) +1195.52 % , from 10.11  to $131.03
Verge (XVG)  +1008.82 % , from $9.62 to $106.67
Ox (ZRX) +734.19 % , from $9.99 to $66.72
Cardano (ADA) + 519.78 % , from $9.57 to $59.31

Worst 5 cryptocurrencies so far :

Next (NXT) -45.67 % , from $9.89 to $5.37
Mona (MONA)  -54.62 % , from $9.76 to $4.43
Pura (PURA) -54.76 % , from $9.62 to $4.35

ADA,Altcoin,"World Mobile Token (WMT), connecting the unconnected, a real-life crypto application built on ADA. Listed later this month on main exchanges.","*Disclaimer :. I am not a telecommunications professional, nor a blockchain expert, nor a financial advisor. I bought a (too) small bag of WMT during public sale back in July. Do your own research. This is just my take on what I understood from the project. Do not try to buy WMT from anyone, it is not yet listed on exchanges*

**TLDR : Rural villages in Africa suffer from a lack of access to education,** **and education is the key to many of world's problems. World Mobile is building a decentralized mobile network, in which community builds antennas to bring coverage, and are rewarded with tokens (World Mobile Token, WMT) paid to use the network. They are for now focusing on building a test-network in remote areas in Zanzibar, part of their ""Connect the Unconnected"" program, and are planning on a full-scale launch in Tanzania Q3-4 2022. It is not available on exchanges yet, but is apparently planned for this month. They have collaborations with IOHK and have met Binance CEO. The team is amazing, their social media is extremely knowledgeable and professional.**

**1 - Project and technology**

Abstract of their Whitepaper :

*A shared economy model to deliver network infrastructure would enable improvements in efficiencies of network design and operation, as well as provide a more fluid delivery of connectivity to users of a network.*

*The use of blockchain in this model enables the removal of intermediaries and a layer of cost from the delivery mechanism. It also enables the rapid expansion of the network thanks to the transparency provided by smart contracts, which allow the participants to have a provable and guaranteed rewards system. We propose a solution to the global problem that nearly half of the world is still not connected, as highlighted by the United Nations.*

*This solution aims to address the affordability issue, as well as the more efficient use of network resources, to enable connectivity to be provided in a more distributed and decentralised manner.*

The technology is based on 3 types of nodes, meshing the whole network

&#x200B;

[Screenshot from their Deck](https://preview.redd.it/ldie9ohpma481.png?width=2258&format=png&auto=webp&s=914d1f3c8c8bbf33d4474ac90701a51a8702794c)

**2 - Team**

I let you read about the whole team on their website, they seem to all be extremely experienced in their own field. Here are a few of the top management to have a first idea.

&#x200B;

* **Micky Watkins (CEO) :** Founder of Yallo Telecoms, raised millions from different huge VCs and Deutsche Telekom  
 
* **Alan Omnet (COO) :** Telecom entrepreneur, has developed and managed telecom services for companies such as American Express, Hertz, and Virgin.  
 
* **Ian Barnett (Director) :** Telecoms entrepreneur, creating telco voice businesses with multi-million dollar turnover, partnering with Citic, Worldcall, Sygmatel, and Lebara in the UK. Forged partnerships with the largest global MNOs and top10 Skype global voice provider.  
 

The advisory board is also composed of huge names, such as : managing director of JP Morgan, Director General of Regulation of Kenya, Senior Credit Officer in Virgin Mobile, WIND, Bouygues Telecom, MD of GE.

**3- Roadmap**

The team is currently deploying their test network in Zanzibar, and expects a fully working network and MainNet launch as of Q3-4-2022. The proof-of-concept is already working.

Everything is recorded and relayed through their [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/WorldMobileTeam/videos)

&#x200B;

[Screenshot from their Deck](https://preview.redd.it/uyd95y3rma481.png?width=2090&format=png&auto=webp&s=b23493081e68bcfd5c50d5bf7404a965cdac41bb)

**4 - Tokenomics**

The public sale was one of the most professional and fair event I have every witnessed in the crypto sphere, with a small supply being released and reserved each week so that anyone that wanted to could get in without being out-rushed by bots like any other launch in there. Unfortunately some countries such as the USA were legally restricted to take part.

Only 10% of the tokens have been released yet through public sale, the rest will be released through the next 20 years to node operators and network operators. The distribution will be as follows :

&#x200B;

* Node operators 29%  
 
* Co-founders & team 19.25%  
 
* Partnerships 7.85%  
 
* Private sale 2.5%  
 
* Early staking rewards 2.5%  
 
* Operation fund 18%  
 
* Public Sale 10%  
 
* Advisors 5.9%  
 
* Community fund 2.0%  
 
* Incentive rewards 3.0%  
 

**5- Competition**

Obvious and only real potential competitor right now is Musk's Starlink, which concerned me about the project at first. Then came this reply by the team in r/WorldMobileToken:

Starlink is an expensive solution for the connected and is currently NOT subsidised anywhere else other than the USA.

WM will fill a vacuum by providing all existing connectivity providers with a way to connect unreachable markets whilst providing big tech companies access to the customers they are looking for. WM will not compete with Starlink, we will be a potential customer for their backhaul services.

It's a common misconception on how Starlink works, and alot of people mis understand, (that's not to say this is the case with you) you cannot just turn on Wi-Fi and connect to starlink there will still need to be infrastructure on the ground to support connectivity, as mentioned above WM provide a use case for back haul. WM is working with existing LEO providers to consider using them for our more remote villages and islands where backhaul is a real challenge.

Many companies have successfully deployed parts of our business already: WiFi hotspots in cafes or restaurants and solar powered nodes have all been field tested. However no one has yet put them together as one solution and built a hybrid mobile network for mass adoption.

We built our network to be technologically agnostic and welcoming to all existing and new node operators to create a truly inclusive connection solution and business opportunity.

Facebook, Microsoft and Google represent the big tech companies trying to connect the seemingly unconnectable. There are over 1000 MNO’s making up more than a 2 trillion dollar market and still half the world remains offline. We believe the failure to provide a sustainable connection is due to their business model. Unlike these big tech companies, we believe a problem shared is a problem solved, together.

World Mobile is based on the sharing economy and incentivizes sustainability by rewarding anyone who joins the network.

World Mobile was created to bring mass inclusion for everyone by providing access to digital connectivity around the world.As more people join the network in our quest for affordable and accessible connectivity which includes benefits like obtaining a digital ID, and subsequently accessing digital banking and facilitating trade, the value of our network will mean everything to the unconnected who are going to get connected. The sharing economy is intrinsic to the strategy behind our network and will be a catalyst for rapid organic mass adoption as network operators and node owners, including local communities and entrepreneurs will be earning and sharing in the rewards. This inherently creates an incentive for everyone involved in the network to promote and protect the network that they all own a piece of. More of the unconnected masses will soon enjoy connectivity and digital identity together, and will get access to many more financial services through the power of the blockchain, which will be a life-changing event for millions.

**5 - Random general thoughts**

Just a few random things I realized since I'm following the project (early 2021) :

&#x200B;

* The communication through Telegram, Reddit and Twitter is amazing. Every single question, even the most retarded I had received a well detailed and very knowledgeable response. Even when some FUD was thrown, all the replies were completely professional  
 
* The public sale was an amazing experience, unlike any other projects were only whales with bots can get in (see tokenomics section)  
 
* People in remote areas of Africa are more educated and developed than we think, but many have to go to the next big town to have access to the internet. I remember a trip in Kenya, where we were visiting a small masai village and people looked like they were living in prehistoric times. We wanted to help them and they casually dropped us their email, telling us they can only respond on mondays and wednesdays when they travel to the nearby town for groceries.  
 
* Bringing connection to these parts means essential businesses will come along, so the World Mobile token will bring even more traction from these businesses needing connection. Positive feedback loop.  
 
* Nodes can be set up anywhere, so even if remote parts of Africa are for now targeted, anywhere in the world we can see antennas pop once the MainNet is live  
 
* Education is the key to many problems in the world. And without connection, many minds can stay blocked to their small scale.  
 

All in all, this is probably my favorite crypto project as it has a real-world application and will help many get access to education, knowledge and other amazing capacities of our modern world.",26,2021-12-08 10:11:46,77

ADA,Altcoin,How about bringing an old coin to life? ,"I have been looking into bitcoin alternatives which have been there for a while and not so popular due to lack of listing or the devs wanted it that way. 

One of those coins is HUSH. During 2017 bull market it has performed but then a downward spiral. But surpirsingly HUSH still has a strong dev team doing frequent releases. Its PoW coin and very similar profile and supply like #Bitcoin. Those Who Missed Out on #Bitcoin can still create an opportunity for their own good.

I have been looking into other altcoins as well, but the market is saturated with 10s of 1000s of coins. Only insiders are making money out of it. What about normal retailers. Normal people who wants to invest? Nobody cares about them really. You either fall into a scam or buy a coin which has grown to its potential. I am talking about people who can only invest in 100s.

So why not try out a coin which has been there for a while, good dev support and wallets. Be the early buyers with very little money. Just invest 10 dollars. It's nothing to lose. 

By the way, HUSH is not easy to buy. It's on TradeOgre or you can mine it. For a normal person TradeOgre will work better.

Think about it fellow reddit people. Is 10 dollars to much to lose to try something out.

Please note this is not for people who had success in trading. But for retailers getting into the crypto market very late.

While it’s common to see celebrities or influencers pump coins without understanding their utility, Sleepless AI has attracted attention from several well-known figures in the tech and crypto community. Although there are no official endorsements yet, there were posts from prominent voices like Elon Musk. 

❤️ Branding 

The project aims to develop AI technologies that are accessible and beneficial to a wide audience, rather than concentrating power in the hands of a few large companies. I consider ""heart"" in its branding as a symbol of its commitment to creating AI that prioritizes user privacy, transparency, and real-world utility.

🙌🏼 Transparency and Team 

The Sleepless AI team is highly active and transparent about their progress. They regularly engage with the community on platforms like Telegram, Discord, and X, sharing updates about development milestones, partnerships, and upcoming features. This level of transparency helps build trust and ensures that the project is moving in the right direction. 

📊 The team has a detailed roadmap (Marketplace, 
Staking and Yield Farming, Partnerships with AI Research Labs) 

🌐 Community 

Sleepless AI is building a decentralized governance model, where token holders can vote on key decisions, from protocol upgrades to funding new AI projects. This gives the community real influence over the direction of the platform, aligning it with the ethos of decentralization and user empowerment.

📈 Future 

Sleepless AI is still in its early stages, with a relatively low market cap compared to more established projects like SingularityNET (AGIX) or Fetch.ai (FET). This gives it significant room for growth, especially if the project gains traction and delivers on its roadmap. As the demand for AI services continues to rise, I think, the potential for Sleepless AI to carve out a niche in this rapidly expanding market is promising.

What do you think about Sleepless AI? Have you looked into its potential?

Ethereum - because its the biggest most well known besides btc, 100% open source, and has grown organically without being pumped 
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/

ADA - because it has a great eco system, the dev team is brilliant, and each day their dapps are growing and growing!
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/

AVAX - because its stable AF and has the ability to allow for building other sub chains with ease and security

DOGE - its an all time favorite meme and possible pump by the musky one woth his new X
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/

LINK - the oracle of all oracles period.

MATIC - a great layer 2 built on eth with cheap gas fees lots of support and vc's dumping cash into.
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/

ATOM - maybe the internet of blockchains one day and the best ALT air drops out there.
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/

MANA - my metaverse play.. hope to break a buck!
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decentraland/

ACH - my longshot on the list but a coin with a ""use case"" registered to transact currency in over 200 countries has been around sinxe 2018 and IMHO the best crypto (and 1st!) fiat onramp in the industry

ADA,Altcoin,"GAINS: the ‘only’ decentralised AND reliable way to leverage trade with 150x leverage, right from your wallet. Follow the breadcrumbs to gains.farm","Cmc link: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gains-farm-v2/


And the trading platform is here: [gains.farm](https://gains.farm/decentralized-trading?a=0xe857cc7ecf1637126db6a1bc15cbb885be838d8f) 


THIS IS NOT A SHILL POST. I have witnessed the mess that leverage trading/futures trading is with the CEXes calling the shots, liquidating positions with scam wicks (yesterday BTC futures spiked to 48k while spot spiked to only 39k) and there is no DEX solution for true leverage trading with high leverage - the few DEX solutions that exist have gaping loopholes, either price is self-calculated, or leverage offered is very small, or they need you to deposit funds into their contract even if you don’t have an active trade on (example dydx)

Below are my findings about gains.farm


1. Leverage trade 21 of the most popular crypto (btc/eth/link/matic/sol/ada etc) with up to 150x leverage right from your wallet without any kyc
2. Supports limit order, stop loss, take profit just like a CEX, but fully decentralised and non-custodial
3. Unlimited liquidity - no order book
4. No funding fee, ever
5. price sourced from top 7 most liquid sources through a custom-built architecture that works with chain link and fetches data real-time with 0 lag
7. Audited 4 times by CERTIK and scores are in all time top 5
8. Operational on polygon for last 6 months - trade with nearly 0 gas cost
9. Main token $GFARM2 has reached its practical max supply at 35k
10. Token has unique burn-mint mechanism - burnt when someone loses a trade, minted when someone wins
11. Since, traders tend to lose in the long run, token is deflationary. In last 6 months, 11% of supply has been burnt
12. If you are a market maker, significant earning potential by adding liquidity to GFARM2-DAI pool in quickswap - 50% of the leverage trading platform’s income distributed to LP stakers
13. Unique NFTs give a boost to the APR (up to 6x boost)
14. Another unique NFT bot let’s you execute other trader’s limit/stoploss/take profit orders and earn a handsome passive income
15. Daily trading volume $10mil/day - huge room for growth available

ADA,Altcoin,What do you think about these hyped projects for 2023?," Hello everyone.  


Every once in a while I do some research here and there, to see which crypto projects are more hyped and talked about. Remember, I'm not saying these are good projects or have strong fundamentals, just that I believe they are more hyped than the others. So they can be a good investment, or a bad one.  


This time I found these:  


1. The obvious ones which are almost always hyped: BTC, ETH, BNB, Doge, Matic and ADA. We all know about them, so let's focus mostly on the others.  
2. Polkadot (DOT)  
3. ApeCoin (APE)  
4. Dash 2 Trade (D2T): This one's not still in exchanges, but supposedly it's a strong crypto platform, and hyped.  
5. The Graph (GRT)  
6. NEAR Protocol (NEAR)  
7. Decentraland (MANA)  


So which one of them do you think will perform better in future? If you have any opinion for (or against) anyone of those, I'll be glad to hear it.

ADA,Altcoin,Pitquidity: Passive income King returning 50% of profits to holders from Node/LP/Staking and more,"   
Make Passive Income so you won't have to grovel to a boss again. It is just one component to being financially free, and is what [Pitquidity.io](https://pitquidity.io/) offers. We have been live for a few months now and are now letting the world know what we have built behind the scenes in our new marketing phase starting now!

Most cryptos are projects where investors put their money into a coin and hope the price goes up. That is the sole dimension most investors look at. We have built [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) to be the best passive income crypto on the market today with our exclusive assets. [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) has project tokens on both ETH and BSC chains that are low tax reflection tokens that reward you in either ETH or BNB for holding $PITQD. All [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) tokens have or will have a very low tax as we encourage volume, and having PITQD as a trading token is another aspect to it's functionality.

Here is the best part!! [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) runs various nodes and manages various staking pools amongst other passive income activities and shares 50% of the weekly profits with token holders each weekend. With the other half of the profits, [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) takes and reinvests into node/staking to grow the asset base. Some of the hallmark assets owned are 5 Gala nodes, 15 instance Energi node, Almost 20k Songbird delegation tokens, Mysterium network and Presearch node operations plus more on ETH, BSC, Solana, Songbird and Polygon networks. All positions can be viewed and tracked on the [Pitquidity Financial Page](https://www.pitquidity.io/financials).

The freeing part is once your position is large enough in PITQD, the ETH and BNB it generates for you will allow you to break free from centralized exchanges like Coinbase to buy ETH or another exchange to buy BNB, as they are deposited in your wallet automatically.

There is also another side of the project called [Hardwood](https://www.pitquidity.io/hardwood) that is a trading floor with various trading tokens that will never be rug pulled.

Some of the tokens reflect back XRP, ADA USD and [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) is adding more tokens regularly. [Hardwood](https://www.pitquidity.io/hardwood)

There is a lot more to the project, and this is just a general overview. but follow the twitter, FB, Reddit etc., and get in the Telegram group for more info on how it works. They all can be found at the bottom of the homepage here: [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/)

ADA,Altcoin,Best way to buy/hold 50 altcoins?,"Steemit user Ashr ran the numbers and putting $100 in each top 100 coin (by market cap) ($10,000 total) back on 7/3/2016 would have grown to $109,819 (11x/1100%) in a year's time.  Although this return pales in comparison to one expected from an actively managed crypto portfolio more heavily skewed toward the most promising coins, it's still nothing to complain about.  

Is there anyone out there who has spread their risk out over 50+ coins and is long (8+ months) on them who would be willing to share how they have gone about it?  ADA, for example, requires an ADA wallet.  By the time you download the wallet, buy the coin, secure the coin, etc. etc., hours have gone by.  Is there an efficient, secure method on buying and holding large quantities of altcoins that we could describe and pin to help Altcoin Redditers?  

Within a time frame that will come faster than we expected it to, I imagine my question will be a question of the past as your tech illiterate uncle will have easy, secure access to the crypto market.

ADA,Altcoin,Opacity Storage (OPCT): A Comprehensive Overview,"Good day Altcoiners! This post will be a comprehensive overview of a small market cap project called **Opacity Storage (OPCT)**.

And yes, I have a bag. It’s one of my biggest holdings next to TEL, ONE, ADA, SIA and ETH. The reason why I post this is because I think small caps also deserve a place in r/altcoin. Especially when it's a project with a real use case and is already functional. Next to all the DeFi, NFT and Meme hype I think utility tokens also deserve some love.

So why Opacity? I'll try to be transparent so I’ll give you the pros and the cons of the project.

CoinMarketCap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/opacity/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/opacity/)

CoinGecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/opacity](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/opacity)

# What is Opacity?

Opacity is a private and protected cloud storage solution and OPCT is their utility token. With Opacity, payments, accounts, and files are 100% private. At the moment OPCT is only used to pay for storage plans. 1 OPCT is currently pegged to 64GB of data storage but the peg will go when their network will be decentralized. When decentralization will become a thing the token will also be used for staking, competition between nodes and (d)apps.

Nowadays data breaches are very common but with Opacity you don't have to worry about that at all. Opacity doesn't require any personal information so you can sign-up for a plan anonymously. They store no information on its users, so their cloud is a perfect place to store private information.

Their way of doing encryption is also interesting. When you want to upload a file via Opacity, the data is split into parts (chunks) and encrypted locally in the browser. This isolation ensures that a malicious actor cannot retrieve the user’s data, as it can only be accessed with the corresponding encryption key: the ​Opacity Handle​.

So without this key no one can access your files. Even if it’s centralized and a hacker gets access to your data, he won’t be able to access it because there’s no way he can decrypt it. Can you imagine how secure and anonymous it will be when they offer decentralized storage? This would be the perfect tool for people living in heavily censored countries like China. Heck, I can name a bunch of industries that will truly benefit from this service for sharing their intellectual property, legal documents and company secrets. I’m calling it, this will be the next Mega.nz!

# What can you expect in the coming months?

So yeah, there you have it. A crypto project with a truly working product and not just hype and words. Their CEO hired a complete new team at the start of this year and they’re now with 14 employees. They held an video AMA some months ago and they do video updates weekly. For such a low mcap this project has a lot to offer. It has potential to compete against other competitors like Sia and Filecoin. Check out the infographic where you can quickly read the benefits of Opacity and compare them with their competitors. Take a good look at the difference in market cap!

# What did they deliver so far in 2021:

* ‘Galaxy’ Whitepaper 2.0 for Decentralization
* Open Beta program for Opacity 2.0
* A lot of AMA’s with their CEO
* Weekly video updates
* Community favorite and call of the month of the CryptoStarship signals group
* Added USDT pair on KuCoin this week
* They recently hired more employees to focus on marketing

# Upcoming:

* Next week: Opacity 2.0, it’s their new and improved file storage system! Think of faster upload/downloads, new webUI, new metadata system, better sharing, updated API for everyone to use, etc...
* Easier ways to pay for their services (BSC or Matic bridge, credit card payments with Indacoin)
* More AMA’s, marketing efforts
* Mobile app for Android and iOS (in Q3)
* Decentralization (first tests in Q3)
* API documentation so more people can build their Apps on their platform
* KuCoin promotions (e.g. trading competition to increase volume)

Now let’s talk about the pros and cons about Opacity. Like I said earlier, I want to be transparent and honest about my findings and not just shill. So here goes:

# Pros:

* Cheap. As of the day of writing 1 OPCT is 22 cents. You can buy a 2 TB storage plan FOR A YEAR on their site for 32 OPCT. That’s $7,04 + ETH gas fees (\~ 10 dollar). Unfortunately the Ether Gas fees are high but it still makes it one of the cheapest storage solutions. For example: a 2 TB Google Drive storage plan costs you $120 per year.
* New team with a lot of experience, check [this Medium post](https://medium.com/opacity-storage/the-journey-to-opacity-2-0-starts-now-ac14bc692d5d) to get some more info about the new team. Talking about experience: their CEO, Jason Coppola worked for *Microsoft*, *Paypal*, and *Salesforce*. He knows how to run the place!
* Low mcap, lots of room to grow. Currently rank #866 on CMC.
* No sign-ups required, truly anonymous. You don’t have to worry that your personal information gets leaked.
* Easy to use, the release of the new mobile app and website will have an easy and improved user interface. Think of Google Drive, but anonymous, protected and decentralized.
* Strongly focused on privacy, uses high encryption. Encryption happens on your computer only, even the metadata of the file is getting encrypted.
* A great community with a lot of developers. Check the [community page](https://www.opacity.io/community-page) to see what’s being built on Opacity so far. This list is only getting bigger when this project grows and API documentation will be released.

# Cons:

* Even if the decentralized network will be deployed later this year, it currently is still centralized on AWS S3. End-to-end encryption on the metadata and files is Opacity’s greatest feature, so that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It’s just that decentralization would make it so much better of course.
* High Ethereum gas fees. If you want to buy an Opacity storage plan you pay an insane high amount of gas fees. Although it’s not Opacity’s fault that these fees are so high, they are planning to use a bridge like BSC or Matic to solve this problem.
* Missed deadlines. Originally Opacity 2.0 would be released in April but it got delayed by a month. Delays are a common thing in development, so it’s not such a huge deal breaker. But I thought it’s worth mentioning it at least.
* The project has a dark past, even if it wasn’t their fault: they are a fork of Oyster (PRL). In late 2018 the founder of the project exit scammed by minting tokens and selling them on the market. Leaving all investors, including the team that worked for him empty-handed. Fortunately, he’s in jail now thanks to a 2-year investigation by the FBI and the help of the Opacity team.

r/Koinos

https://coinmarketcap.com/nl/currencies/koinos/

Koinos.io

Our mission is to empower people through ownership of their digital selves and blockchain is the most promising technology for accomplishing this mission. Blockchain-based applications can add value to people’s lives in an infinite variety of ways but building such applications is far too difficult, time consuming, and expensive.
In order to accomplish our mission we need to dramatically expand the quantity of blockchain powered applications in existence, and the number of people capable of using those applications, which is why we are building a brand new blockchain from the ground up to make it fast, easy, and affordable to build blockchain-based applications that are capable of delighting users.

The Blockchain
When it launches the Koinos mainnet will be a fast and fee-less blockchain that enables developers to create an unlimited number of free accounts for their users. Koinos won’t just lower the barriers to entry, it will obliterate them and open up blockchain applications to an order of magnitude more users.
At OpenOrchard we are developer obsessed which is why Koinos will enable developers to use the programming languages they already know and love thanks to WASM integration. Koinos will start with C++ support, followed soon after by typescript, and then whatever programming languages developers want most like .net and Go.
Thanks to these features, Koinos will deliver an unparalleled experience to both developers and their users, but that won’t launch for another 6 months, so what have we been doing up until now?

The Framework
We have built a brand new, high performance, vertically scalable, blockchain framework which can acquire any feature through smart contract modules running in the virtual machine. Because these smart contracts can be upgraded in-band, any behavior can be added to the blockchain without requiring a hardfork. This unlocks a new capability we call “modular upgradeability” which resolves one of the biggest challenges facing existing blockchains; how difficult they are to upgrade.

Modular Upgradeability
Modular upgradeability enables us to rapidly add different features to the framework without impacting any other part of the blockchain. This is how we will be able to offer a testnet in just 3 months that delivers Ethereum feature parity, but with WASM smart contracts, fast block times, and fee-less transactions. While the testnet will feature proof of work, the Koinos blockchain framework makes it easy for us to swap that consensus algorithm out for the totally new and different algorithm that we’re developing for mainnet.
Thanks to modular upgradeability, individual upgrades can be pushed to the network much like an operating system patch but with an on-chain record of the entire path that the upgrade took. Instead of having to package critical upgrades into time consuming, political, and risky hardforks, individual fixes can be pushed to the network the moment they are ready enabling Koinos to rapidly improve itself. It is that capability that we believe makes Koinos the first blockchain in history capable of evolving.

Scalability
After upgradeability, the next major challenge facing existing blockchains is scalability. Blockchains hold on to every transaction and smart contract that has ever been added to them, regardless of whether they get used or not. That means that the cost of lugging around all of this expensive data gets baked into the cost of every new transaction which itself adds even more information to the chain. All of this old and unused data is responsible for the vast majority of the cost of running a blockchain. But what if we could remove all of that data, while retaining the ability to bring it back to life as if it had never left like MAGIC?

State-Paging
Well we have figured out how to do exactly that. We call it state-paging and Koinos will be the first blockchain ever to have it. Not only is this a genuine innovation that could be THE key to scaling blockchain to the masses, but existing blockchains like EOS and Ethereum cannot take advantage of this capability without totally rearchitecting their entire blockchain.
I saved state-paging for last because it is both highly innovative and highly experimental. All of the algorithms have been written and tested. We know we can page data out and back in without any loss in trustlessnes. State-paging works. What we’re not 100% sure about, is how much the memory savings will outweigh additional bandwidth consumption. But that’s mainly because we don’t know how people will use Koinos. In our tests we found that were state paging a part of existing blockchains, state size could be decreased by as much as 78% and that number would only increase as the blockchain got older. If we see similar numbers on Koinos, then state-paging will be a game-changer.
It’s just very important to us that we be upfront about what we have already developed, what we know we can develop but haven’t yet, and what we just don’t know yet. What we believe very much, is that Koinos will be our best attempt to resolve the major issues holding back blockchain adoption and denying people the empowerment that will come from digital self ownership. If this sounds like something that you want to be a part of, then we invite you to join us by firing up those miners.
Lastly, we really want to make sure that you receive important information about Koinos like how to claim your tokens when mainnet launches, so please join our mailing list by going to koinos or openorchard.

Upper bounds
At most 100,000,000 KOIN will be minted during the ERC20 phase.
After the airdrop on the Koinos blockchain mainnet, the Koinos blockchain will mint KOIN tokens at a rate of up to 15% per year.
Therefore, it is quite possible that up to 115,000,000 KOIN may exist one year after the launch of the Koinos mainnet.
There is no specific long-term upper bound on the amount of KOIN that will ever exist.
Importantly, Koinos's extreme upgradeability adds some degree of uncertainty to any discussion of the system's future trajectory:
The Koinos blockchain's governance system will be able to upgrade any part of the system.
We recommend that governance system participants should not ratify any upgrade that results in more than 15% per year minting.
However, it is possible that governance participants will not follow this recommendation.
This means it is theoretically possible KOIN tokens may be printed in excess of the 15% per year limit if such changes are approved by governance.

FAQ

How decentralized is Koinos?
Koinos is not a blockchain, it is a blockchain building technology (think Hyperledger, Cosmos, Polkadot) that makes it an order of magnitude faster and easier to launch high performance blockchains that are capable of evolution. It is the core technology engineered to advance our mission to accelerate the transition to a more decentralized future.
This step up improvement in ease of use for developers is accomplished through the engineering of a framework that allows for any feature of a Koinos blockchain to be added or modified simply by writing smart contracts in the most used programming languages in the world (C++, TypeScript, Python, Go, etc.) and uploading them to the blockchain.
Making it far easier for developers to launch their own blockchains with unique value propositions does have important implications as far as the decentralization of the ecosystem because the more options people have, the more decentralized the ecosystem.

What is the TPS (transactions per second)?
This is another question we get a lot and it highlights again the common misunderstanding people have about Koinos. Koinos is a blockchain framework. A minimum viable blockchain waiting to get features from smart contracts that are uploaded by developers. How many transactions a given blockchain can process per second is a function of its block size and its block time (how frequently it produces blocks) which will be parameters that are set by developers launching Koinos blockchains.
Yes, Koinos Group is designing a flagship implementation of the Koinos blockchain framework (the “mainnet”), but we are still primarily working on the blockchain framework. Believe it or not, the hard part of building a blockchain is building the framework. Writing smart contracts is relatively fast and easy for software engineers with the level of experience and skill that we have, that’s exactly why we designed Koinos to take full advantage of smart contracts! The problem we found when we began this journey is that all of the existing blockchain frameworks were remarkably difficult to use.
We knew we could work with them, but we wanted anyone to be able to boot up their own blockchain in seconds, not months or years. We knew it was possible, but it was almost like the people who were creating these frameworks didn’t want other people using them to build competing blockchains.

What about the KOIN ERC20? ICO? Pre-Mine?
Our mission is to accelerate the transition to a more decentralized future, NOT to launch a token that moons and retire to some tropical island. We launched the KOIN ERC20 as a proof of work mineable token on the Ethereum blockchain to pre-seed the Koinos ecosystem with a base level of decentralization. This means that the only way to acquire KOIN was through PoW mining or open market purchases so there was no pre-mine, ICO, IEO, or any other IxO (lol).
It is a game wherein people can sacrifice computational work to prove to one another their commitment to a shared mission and vision for the future of blockchain. Once Koinos mainnet launches, the ERC20 will cease to provide this value, and instead the mainnet token will be a better tool for bootstrapping the decentralization of a new dApp or Koinos-based blockchain.
We believe that the key to accomplishing our mission is making it faster, easier, and more profitable to launch blockchain-based applications. We believe that competition is healthy and the more blockchains there are meeting the wide variety of user needs, the better. The Koinos blockchain framework is engineered to become the most used blockchain framework in the space. The KOIN ERC20 can be an asset to any Koinos-blockchain developer, not just Koinos Group.

But what about Mainnet?!!!
The most innovative component of Koinos is what we call “modular upgradeability.” Moving the entire system into smart contracts, allows blockchain developers like us to write system features orders of magnitude faster.
We haven’t disclosed details about the Koinos mainnet features because we haven’t started working on them yet. These are the features that most people are interested in (consensus algorithm, governance system, staking mechanism, resource system, etc.). We have internal designs of these systems that we have been refining as we developed the framework, but these will likely change as we begin implementing them in smart contracts. That’s why we will only disclose these details as we begin working on those smart contracts in the coming months so be sure to follow us for updates. But again, these features are optimized for efficiency, flexibility, and most importantly decentralization, not impressing people with large-but-meaningless numbers.
The reason to be interested in Koinos is not because of the high level features (like TPS). Such focus misses the entire point of Koinos. Even on a public Koinos-based blockchain, all the most important features can be upgraded by governance at any point without a hard fork, meaning that any high level feature is likely to change!
Koinos is not optimized for any specific high level feature, it is optimized to improve at a more rapid rate than any other blockchain.
In the context of TPS, that means our goal is not to launch with the highest number, but to increase that number over time (if desirable) through optimizations and upgrades.

How is the team funded? Can you survive for the coming 3+ years?
Koinos Group is a private company started by the core development team behind the Steem blockchain to accelerate the transition to a more decentralized future by focusing on accessibility. This team worked together for 4+ years at Steemit on the Steem blockchain, at the time the most accessible blockchain by orders of magnitude, and we have now been working together for nearly 2 years on Koinos. Every member of Koinos Group has been working solely for equity in the company, which means they believe in the product and the business plan, and have a vested interest in seeing both the platform and the company succeed.
Koinos Group had to acquire its KOIN like everyone else through either PoW mining or open market purchases, making it impossible to confuse holding KOIN as any kind of investment in Koinos Group. We had to acquire our KOIN at a loss and will only recoup that loss by adding value to the Koinos ecosystem and Koinos Group. This aligns our incentives with the incentives of the Koinos community.
We believe very much in our business model which is based on offering valuable developer tooling that will make it faster, easier and more profitable to launch blockchain-based applications. Koinos is our secret weapon for delivering unbeatable products and services, and we know it better than anyone else because we built it. We believe that Koinos Group could generate incredible revenue and profit margins and it is this profit potential that serves as the incentive for Koinos Group members. In this sense Koinos Group is modeled after a more traditional tech startup.
Increasing the value of Koinos (which is not the same as increasing the price of KOIN which we do not comment on) is fundamental to our business model, but it is NOT the source of our revenue. Currently Koinos Group does not generate revenue, but thanks to the incredible talent of our founding team members, our operating expenses are very low.
We are also exploring fundraising opportunities by looking for investors who believe in our business model, not people who are looking to speculate on the KOIN price which is more efficiently done through open markets and has nothing to do with our business model.
We have acquired our KOIN like any other developer to ensure that we have access to the computational capacity our developers and their users will need to use the amazing decentralized applications we expect to see on Koinos owing to its free accounts, free transfers, and free smart contracts.

What is the scaling mechanism?
Another way to think about Koinos is that it is a blockchain optimized for flexibility. Some blockchains are built to scale using sharding. Some are focused on interchain communication. Some are focused on other supposed scaling “solutions.” Scaling is a process, not a problem that is ever “solved.” Koinos is designed to leverage any or all of these systems if and when necessary, and if desired by on-chain governance.
Other blockchain projects take a top-down approach, deciding at the beginning what the “right” solution is and then specifically architecting their blockchain to implement those solutions. This might sound good to people who don’t understand proper system design, but it is highly constraining and means that there is a very clear path to defeat; picking the wrong solution. No developer is perfect, so engineering yourself into a corner is never a good idea.
This approach also leaves no room for developer feedback because the system is already designed before the developer ever gets involved. It leaves no room for new technological innovations because it is impossible to predict what innovations will come in the future or when they will be sufficiently adopted to justify integration.
Koinos is not optimized for any high level feature (like “scaling”). Koinos is a blockchain-based protocol optimized to rapidly integrate the most innovative technologies as they emerge. Yes, this is fundamentally different than any other blockchain protocol in existence which makes it difficult for people to wrap their minds around its value. We are working hard to figure out better ways to communicate this value which is why we appreciate people asking these kinds of questions.
There are many interesting, important, and challenging problems that many amazing open source teams are working to solve. But the beauty of open source is that once those solutions exist, we all get to take advantage of them. We believe very much in the open source ethos and its power to deliver incredible innovations. We ourselves are working to deliver a very powerful open source solution that any developer can use to leverage the power of blockchain within their application.
Unfortunately (or fortunately for us) so many teams design their systems in ways that limit their ability to take advantage of the unlimited value that continuously emerges from the open source community.
The problem we are trying to solve is how to make those technologies available to blockchain developers the moment that they’re ready which also means using our expertise to assess whether a given technology is ready or not. It is far too frequently the case that developers will begin building on a solution long before it is ready simply because it claims to solve some important problem. This is incredibly risky for both themselves and their users. It is choosing to trust a (often anonymous) team when the whole point of decentralized solutions is to be trustless. A perfect example of this right now is the prevalence of cross-chain bridges. Very few, if any, of these are secure.
As the first, and flagship, implementation of Koinos the mainnet will be like an “innovation vacuum” sucking in the best technologies as they emerge and become secure. That will be the source of its value. Lots of people are working on scaling solutions, and as with any important feature, we are researching those solutions. Our goal will be to make all the best solutions available to Koinos blockchain developers, not pick any specific one and certainly not to develop one ourselves.
Developing novel solutions is a big red flag that either Koinos is not sufficiently flexible, or that no good solution already exists, meaning it’s an extremely difficult or impossible problem to solve. We’re not saying we won’t ever develop novel solutions, but our goal is to minimize them and ensure that those solutions increase the flexibility of Koinos while advancing our mission of accelerating the transition to a more decentralized future.
Far too often teams develop novel solutions as a marketing exercise which is not just a recipe for failure, it demonstrates a cynical world view that we do not share. We believe that people are ready for decentralized solutions that make their lives better. We’re focused on empowering developers to build those solutions and anything that distracts from that mission is unacceptable.

What about composability?
Now this is a question I can answer in a straightforward fashion (lol)! Koinos has the highest degree of composability possible because it is the only blockchain framework to move all of the system logic into smart contracts. When we’re talking about composability in the blockchain context, what we are talking about is the ability for decentralized application developers to repurpose code that is already running on the blockchain within their applications (i.e. to “compose” their applications).
Most blockchains that claim “high composability” are just saying that they don’t have sharding, which is an attempt to rebrand a limitation as a value-add. As I’ve explained ad nauseum, Koinos is optimized for flexibility which means that it could shard, or not shard, based on the smart contracts that are running on it.
As far as composability on Koinos, because all of the system logic is contained in smart contract modules, application developers will be able to not just repurpose the smart contracts written by other dApp developers, they’ll be able to repurpose the code written by the most experienced blockchain engineers in the world; the engineers building Koinos-based blockchains.
Mainnet will just be the first Koinos-based blockchain, so as more engineers launch more Koinos-based blockchains, even more system contracts will be running on Koinos giving dApp developers even more high quality smart contracts to draw from.
But wait there’s more! Because these smart contracts will be written in an ever growing number of the most used programming languages in the world, developers won’t just be able to find the perfect smart contract for their needs, they will be able to find smart contracts written in their preferred programming language! This takes the composability of Koinos, already far greater than any other protocol, to an entirely new level!

**The metaverse is everywhere**

It seems that the crypto community is way ahead of the curve. Nothing new there. Facebook announced that they had changed their name to Meta to reflect their focus on the metaverse. Whilst blockchain entrepreneurs have been developing metaverse applications for a few years now Facebook gave it mainstream recognition. Before that announcement the average person hadn't even heard of the metaverse and if they had they didn't have a clue what it meant.

Here is a brief definition for those in the metaverse beginner camp:

A shared, realistic, and immersive computer simulation of the real world or other possible worlds, in which people participate as digital avatars.

Investors are piling into cryptocurrencies which have even a faint connection to the metaverse. 

The top 5 cryptos in the metaverse space are:

Axie Infinity $7.0bn

Decentraland $5.0bn

The Sandbox $5.1bn

Enjin Coin $2.9bn

Illuvium $0.8bn

A few long shots worth a closer look:

Somnium $0.2bn

Rentible $7m

The metaverse is an interesting concept to investigate, from an investors point of view anyway. There are two plays. The first is investing in the cryptocurrency and the second is buying land. Let’s take Decentraland for instance. Its fully diluted market cap of $10 billion is priced to perfection. In other words, the valuation already assumes they will be a leading player in this market going forward. And that thinking is also priced into the value of their virtual land which is selling for up to millions of dollars. 

Virtual land is like real estate. It is in finite supply with location playing an important role in its value. Canny investors are buying up virtual land plots on various metaverses expecting to either develop it, rent it or flip it.

The metaverse is set to be part of our future. However, a few words of warning. Don't go rushing out to buy the next shiny metaverse project. 99.9% of the new projects coming to market will fail. Also remember, buying virtual land comes with risk. Like buying land in the real world, if you purchase a plot within a metaverse where there are few visitors your land will have as much value as buying land in the middle of the Sahara. 

**dYdX and the perpetual**

Let’s start with, what is a perpetual?

A perpetual swap is something similar to a futures contract. The core difference is that perpetuals do not have expiration dates. 

dYdX’s perpetuals have proved so popular that they have eclipsed Coinbase in daily volumes. It achieved this by solely offering perpetual for four assets. dYdX is now one of the most liquid exchanges in crypto.

**Rapid fire**

The influential FATF (Financial Action Task Force) **wants governments to hold the people behind DeFi protocols accountable**. This will send the shivers down the backs of the many platforms that have decided on anonymity. This proposal is not likely to come in for some time, but it is something that we can see being implemented and enforced ruthlessly.

Muslim leaders have warned their flock that **crypto is forbidden**. According to these well-informed individuals, ‘it has elements of uncertainty, wagering, and harm’.

Binance CEO announced that he intends to **give away up to 99% of his wealth**. No doubt this raised the eyebrows of US authorities who will be eyeing much of his wealth for themselves!

Binance made **Know Your Customer (KYC) mandatory** for global users in their effort to make Binance a regulatory compliant business. 

In another attack on the DeFi space. BlockFi, which offers high interest rates to investors, is being **investigated by the SEC**. The SEC considers that BlockFi’s interest accounts represent the offering of unregistered securities, something that no doubt the SEC will use to target many other high profile yield farming platforms in the near future.

Cardano the blockchain platform has **achieved over 20 million transactions worth over $18 billion**. That figure is only slightly lower than that of Bitcoin and compares to Ethereum’s $9 billion. The price of ADA however is in the doldrums with many complaining of the lack of DAPPs because of its complex programming language. 

eToro announced it was **delisting Cardano and TRON** by the end of the year for US customers as it believes these coins could represent securities.

We continue to build our library of interesting content from emerging projects and technologies in the blockchain space. Inside Track is the best way to learn about cryptocurrency from experts in the field as well as discover emerging projects from NFTs to DeFi, from memecoins to launchpads. 

This month we produced the following Inside Track podcasts.

**OIN Finance** \- the DeFi platform talks staking and regulation.

**Rx SeedCoin** \- the project aiming to relieve world hunger, homelessness and sickness talks combining crypto with compassion.

**Coinberry** \- the first regulated crypto exchange in Canada talks competing with Binance, regulation, the future of crypto and what crypto the CEO would spend a spare $1,000 on.

**Staking and Yield Farming**

Each week we provide the latest APRs from leading staking and yield farming platforms together with news from the industry.

Staking and yield farming has been a major driver in the huge growth in the DeFi sector. Investors are being enticed by the massive APRs on offer. Totally new projects tempting investors with returns of 10,000+ % are able to attract a deluge of money from investors who don’t seem concerned with the high risks involved. Our weekly review looks at the best platforms out there and the ones to avoid. We attempt to weed out the platforms that we think won’t stand the test of time.

**Catchy by name Catchy by nature**

A tracker wallet that has to be tried to be appreciated!

Tired of manually adding token addresses to Trustwallet? Tired of seeing out-of-date and inaccurate balances? Tired of switching apps to check on your multiple wallets? We present CATCHY, an innovative solution that facilitates wallet tracking, implemented directly on Telegram, the flagship crypto platform. CATCHY aims to provide a suite of crypto tracking tools for Telegram users. From the currently available multichain (BSC + ETH) Telegram wallet tracker, to the upcoming whale watcher, price alert, and sniper bot tools, our vision is to create an ecosystem that satisfies all crypto enthusiast needs. Today, we’ll give a small overview of our multi chain wallet tracker and the many useful features it has to offer.

Our Telegram wallet tracker is made with both accessibility and convenience in mind. Simply talk to one of our tracker bots (found in our Telegram group [CATCHYTOKEN](https://t.me/CATCHYTOKEN)), and it will direct you to the tracker bot you were specifically assigned to. From there on out, you’ll only use one command: /wallet. On your first use, the bot will notify you that you haven’t added any wallet addresses to the tracker and will ask you about the blockchain you wish to use. Keep in mind that you can add up to 3 wallets at any time, and they can belong to different blockchains, so your choice here isn’t final. Reply to the tracker bot’s message with a wallet address of your choosing, and you’re good to go! 

Note that the tracker DOES NOT require a wallet connection, making it the absolute safest option to keep tabs on your balances. The tracker can never be linked back to your person either, as it relies on an anonymous numerical ID that is unique to each individual. The bot you were assigned to will remember you through that ID, so you’ll never have to go through the setup process again.

After you’re done with the first step, the tracker will immediately attempt to fetch your wallet balances based on publicly available data. Just wait a couple seconds and VOILA: the balance of every token in your wallet, valued in USD and BNB/ETH (depending on the chain), ranked by value. These values are the most up-to-date balances you can fetch, as they rely on the BSC and ETH blockchains directly instead of waiting for other services to supply prices (like Trustwallet for example). From this point onwards, you’ll rarely ever need to use /wallet again, as the buttons supplied under your balance sheet are more than enough to satisfy any needs you might have. 

The \[Refresh\] button immediately updates your balances, the \[Gains\] button enables percentage gain calculation from the last time you pressed \[Refresh\], the \[MC\] button adds the market cap of every token directly into the balance sheet, and the \[Charts\] button offers immediate access to the charts of your tokens. The \[Manage\] button allows you to add wallets (up to 3) or remove existing ones, as well as play around with language settings (English and Chinese are available at the moment). 

At CATCHY, your convenience is our utmost priority, and we hope that is reflected in the intuitive design of our tracker and its ease of use. However, our most convenient feature is one that you’ll rarely ever notice: Scam/Dead token filtering. Unlike sites like poocoin, where you have to manually hide dust and dead tokens, our tracker automatically does that for you by employing our own filtering system. And if our system oversteps its boundaries, you can use the \[Show Missing & Hide Existing Tokens\] button to take full control of your tracker’s output. These choices will be saved forever, so you’ll never have to reconfigure your balance sheet. 

Our tracker strikes a delicate balance between convenience and complexity, offering you extensive control of what you see without sacrificing simplicity and accessibility. The tracker is currently free for users to try and explore, but in the near future, you will have to hold CATCHY to make use of its features, making it the first of many use cases that are coming down the line. Please visit our website https://catchy.finance/ for further details on the tracker and other products currently in the works.

ADA,Altcoin,"FUD my alts, shill me yours! (Binance coins only pls)","I'm beginning to think it's not wise to get trapped in the echo chambers of coin specific subreddits and other online forms. Give me some FUD on my coins and shill me yours ( Binance coins preferred). Don't worry about hitting me hard with FUD, I've had strong hands thus far, but I would love to hear opposing views.

My alt picks:
OMG -solid team 
NEO -wish I had more, 2018 might 
XLM -solid partners, blue collar XRP
IOTA -interesting concept 
BAT-marketing token
STRAT-good team
XVG -a silly hold IMO (Monero is king?)
EOS- fomo fomo fomo
XRP- sketch, solid returns tho 
TRX -fomo got to me, seems overvalued
SUB - come on, why not?
QSP - personal favorite
ICX -been killing it lately on returns 
FUN- a long shot gamble, ironic right?
STRAT- solid team, okay partners
VIB- bought on a whim, website screams marketing scam. I fell for the pretty website lol
LTC -served me incredibly well, but then Charlie Lee loves fud his brainchild. Get off twitter CL. 

Regrets (missed the boat):
LSK - scoped it out at $2, $6, & $8. Then I got busy with school and never pulled the trig. What a rookie!

ADA - people love to shill, but I want to hear some FUD about it. Such a quick moonshot to top 25 CoinMarketCap. YouTuber shills everywhere!

ADA,Altcoin,Buy great tech instead of stupid hyped pump and dump coins,"Make crypto great again! Blockchain and the techniques around them are still new and great innovations will come. People already buy coins for specific cases. A coin for cars, gambling, healthcare etc. WHY buy already a coin like that when the blockchain platforms are still under big development! I recommend that we invest in tech that can accomplish way more than just a shitty coin for a shitty usecase. Im talking about platformcoins where there is room for updating things instead of forking.

I liked neo, ada, lisk eos, rchain. Now I found nebulas amd really looking into to it, find it a piece of art amongst the other!

Hope this will help your choice in investing.

Good projects and tech wont give you fast return as most pump and dump coins, but the risk is much less and steady grow is always better!",28,2018-01-19 08:07:20,29

ADA,Altcoin,Litecoin a good hold??,"I have some litecoins, and im wondering whether its a good long term hold? I understand its the ""silver to bitcoins gold"" which makes sense, the transactions are very quick and cheap. Theres 4 times as many coins, 4 blocks mined for every bitcoin block etc. 

Im not a trader or a short term holder, i want to hold for a long time. Currently my plan is to buy 50% btc 20% ltc 15% ada 15% dot. I also hold etherium as well as monero, but i mine those, i dont buy them, and they will make up what ever % they happen to make up. I did buy dot, but couldnt secure it with trezor, so i didnt feel comfortable holding it, but i may hold short term in exodus if there are any plans to update trezor with support, if not, 60% btc and 20% ada. 

If you have any recommendations about adjustments to my portfolio, please let me know, im willing to drop ltc if its not a good long term hold, as im really not sure about it.

\-The idea of a ""Gem"" based market backed by omi, giving ""no-coiners"" the ability to purchase NFTs

\-Powerful Alfred Kahn ([https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfred-kahn-cranekahn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfred-kahn-cranekahn)) as THE DAMN HEAD OF LICENSING PEOPLE<----- .... I shouldn't need to say much more other than the fact that this is THE ... PERSON... WHO IS SOLEY.... responsible for the metamorphosis from pocket monsters to pokemon and marketing it to the western audience.... if anyone can make pokemon NFTs a reality it is this man...... Not to mention Yu-Gi-Oh, Ninja Turtles, One Piece, Etc...

\-Beautiful tokenomic structure. A lot of projects have deflationary burn mechanics built into the system, I'm not here to moon/fanboy over that, but adding a deflationary structure to the native asset backing already limited in mint NFT's, they will gain in value over time not only from consumer demand, but because as omi rises in price, each gem you transfer back to omi is worth more and more. ((assuming they get the damn wallet converter bugs worked out)(I cut slack because theyre still in alpha and running on GoChain)... which brings me to my next statements.....

\- THEYRE STILL IN ALPHA <<<<<---------

\-THEYRE OPERATING ON GOCHAIN>>>>>IMMUTABLE/ETH PLATFORM MIGRATION COMING<<<<-----

\- sub sub

\- The project is only in alpha and VEVE brings in 350000 users already....

\- Transactions are gimmicky and slow at this state (reference to why above) but thats because it is running off the Gochain blockchain.... wtf is that. nobody's heard of that shit in like 4 years.... what other decent projects use gochain like wth seriously. BUT THATS ONLY BULLISH, if the migration to an ERC token working with IMX(immutable X) WOooooOO baby we gots ourselves a winner

\- and now to the enlightenment.....l downloaded the metaverse that the put out to showcase as a teaser for what is to come ([https://www.veve.me/](https://www.veve.me/)). VEVE is not just a NFT marketplace... This shit is gonna be huge. this Metaverse is totally seperate from VEVE. Ecomi has shit stirring ladies and gentlemen. in 5-10 years from now i believe you will see forniite-like levels of video game quality, operating off the ecomi platfom, using IN GAME NFTS THAT YOU CAN USE IN YOUR GAMES..... THINK OF HOW MUCH MONEY GOES INTO A SKIN THAT YOU CAN NEVER SELL OR DO ANYTHING WITH EVER AGAIN.... now imagine all of the money you've invested into video game skins but instead they're encrypted digital asset that are limited in supply and storable in a seed phrase locked wallet..... big things are coming ladies and gentlemen.

CONCLUSION.

If you're at a loss on ecomi, its okay.... do. not. worry. at all. seriously.

The current price while I am writing this is 0.00285. <<<<-------

I am 100% confident I will be looking back on this price in regret that I didn't allocate more of my portfolio to ecomi. (my HODLINGS - #1 ETH - #2 ADA - # 3 OMI #4 LINK.... so hopefully you see the projects I believe in aren't some shit-coins and I'm not just moonboying this thing. I really do believe in the project long term along with the team)

Hopefully you enjoyed the post, be excited for whats to come. 🚀 ⭕️⭕️⭕️🚀⭕️⭕️⭕️ 🚀",13,2021-07-26 05:42:48,4

ADA,Altcoin,My portfolio - roast me!,"This is my portfolio, 40% in ETH as I'm a believer in ETH 2.0 making ETH the first blockchain with high consumer and institutional adaption, PoS, scalability and so on. 

Rest is a mix of handpicked coins and the top market cap coins. Planning a 40:60 ratio for the time being. Thoughts? Also any particular technologies or niches I am not exposed to? Would love your thougts on that aswell.

The handpicked coins are:

* LTO

Low market cap (\~250th), being used, top 10 on-chain transactions. Check out their partnerships with UN and more on their website.

* LINK

Serves to get exposure to oracle technology. Also a top 10-15 market cap coin.

* CAKE

Because BSC is the alternative to Ethereum for the time being. PancakeSwap has higher volume than Uniswap recently. Kind of a hedge against ETH also?

* BAT

For the disruptive potential on the whole online experience and already solid adaption. Users are increasing every week.

* UNI

Because it is the largest DEX, to get exposure to true DeFi as opposed to XRP, BNB, CAKE that are all centralized in some way.

I have also chosen to ban some coins (subject to change), these are:

DOGE, BCH, LTC

These coins have in common that their primary usecase is as payment tokens.

The rest (BNB, XRP, ADA and DOT) are the top market cap coins excluding BTC that I don't already hold.

Or would it be better to have a larger investment in 5-10 projects which are more established?

ADA,Altcoin,Small investments in altcoins.,"Hello 👋 I am new in the cryptos/blockchain industry, super excited to learn and interested of the what is no doubt the future.

I am making small investments in the BTC, Ethereum at the moment (100€ or so weekly). On the side I am putting even smaller amount in other projects(BTT, BAT, ADA etc..). That got me thinking if this is a beneficial way of investing in the long term? I am not trading any coins and I prefer to hold them for a long time as well(not too interested in the pump and dump idea). 

I am staring to think that I am getting in to too many projects with small amount of money and in the long term it is not be beneficial to me. Is it better to limit the projects and invest bigger sums in them? 

Hope the question is clear and any advice is welcome. Let me know your early days in the coin game and things you wish you knew in the beginning.

ADA,Altcoin,Help me spread my eggs!,"Hi, 

I'm from a 3rd world country and I'm looking to invest in the crypto market before going to study abroad. 

I have a budget of \~4300USD to invest and I've done my fair share of research and this is what I've concluded:

1. BTC 1000 USD. Lowest risk, my prediction is that it'll reach 200k/per by the end of this year. 
2. ETH 1000 USD. ETH is the top altcoin right now from my understanding and the services it provides are fantastic. I hope it'll overcome its gas issue in the near future.
3. ADA 1000 USD. The contracts and investments it is making in Africa appear promising and  Charles Hoskinson just seems like a genuinely good person who wants to help the world. 
4. LTC 800 USD. Isn't this coin just an improved BTC?
5. DOT 500USD. I have high hopes for its scalability plans. 

Of course, I'm no investment advisor, nor am I looking for 1, but is my investment plan derived from my own research into the crypto market. Would you guys offer any non-professional advice or any opinion on my plan?

I just left things alone since then. I  didn't want to see the money lost. Fast forward to April 3, 2021. I  wake up and wanna check how they're doing. Not bad, I made my money back  and then some, but of course, lots have changed. For starters, because  I'm a resident in the US/NY I can not sell the random coins into BTC.

Selling to BTC and transferring to coinbase is my only real option.

ADA,Altcoin,"""Cheap"" coins are not as cheap as they seem","We've just added feature to our comparison tool. You can compare coins by their levels of supply (either total or circulating). We normalise the price of the coin by removing unit bias. This feature gives you a good view of the coins that look ""cheap"" but are probably not as cheap as they seem.

E.g: We assume that ADA had the same circulating supply as BTC, and use the formula (ADA Supply / BTC supply * ADA Price) to remove unit bias. Under these conditions, ADA price would be $ 1,020. Matching by total supply, ADA price = $ 1,419

It's definitely not as cheap as it seemed. See more at: http://matchcoins.info/?c1=bitcoin&c2=cardano

ADA,Altcoin,Can I ask you guys for advice? I'm thinking of consolidating my holdings...,"Right now I have 19 coins in various amounts that I'm into happy to hold. I like being diversifyed, but I also like the idea of larger quantities within the coins I really like or see doing well. What I'm considering is converting some of my coins that are fairly high already in market cap into solid projects that are lower in market cap. The logic I'm going under is that my overall portfolio is more likely to grow long-term this way. I really love all the projects I'm, and I can get emotionally attached to some of them, but in this moment I'm thinking more in terms of raw earning potential. I'm not sure if this is a good idea, and ultimately I need to research and personally decide for myself, but I'd love to get some opinions.  Specifically, I have a decent amount of xlm and ada (the latter I've already taken profits from early Jan) - and I'm thinking about converting them to add to my position of omg, eos, and icx. What's your personal take on this?",4,2018-01-29 03:24:15,11
ADA,Altcoin,Data from the top 20 fastest growing communities in crypto over the last month,"Hey everyone, for the past couple months I have been working on a project called [Coinmunity](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinmunity-bitcoin-altcoin-app/id1322869245?mt=8). Coinmunity is an app that focuses on the growth of crypto communities, which in the market right now, has so much effect in driving price changes. Each day it tracks which coins have the combined highest % of growth in their Twitter and Reddit communities combined.

&nbsp;

Today, Coinmunity has now been live for one month, so I thought I would share what patterns I have personally picked out, having worked on the data, and observing the rankings during development and while live.

&nbsp;

What I have noticed is that you will see certain coins start to creep up higher and higher into the top 10 or 15 communities consistently before a price increase. The best example is TRX. You can see from this reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7k2c4g/congrats_rtronix_you_were_the_top_growing/) that I made 27 days ago, that /r/Tron had the top community while it was still at $.01 ( and it continues to consistently be in top 10 even now.) I think most of us can agree TRX has some big issues, but the point is that it’s very important to know which coins have the most eyes on them; because when people are watching a coin, they’ll usually buy it.

&nbsp;

**Here are the 20 coins with the most growth in their communities in the last 30 days:**

[#1 TRX](/r/Tronix) -  **Price Change:** +2664.018%, **Total Social Change:**+3904.851%

[#2 VEN](/r/Vechain) - **Price Change:** +709.507%, **Total Social Change:**+974.497%

[#3 XVG](/r/VergeCurrency) - **Price Change:** +2005.76%, **Total Social Change:**+925.614%

[#4 ADA](/r/Cardano) - **Price Change:** +467.414%, **Total Social Change:**+714.406%

[#5 FUN](/r/FunFairTech) - **Price Change:** +366.608%, **Total Social Change:**+611.430%

[#6 REQ](/r/RequestNetwork) - **Price Change:** +646.897%, **Total Social Change:**+607.782%

[#7 BNB](/r/Binance) - **Price Change:** +546.153%, **Total Social Change:**+ 558.920%

[#8 SUB](/r/SubstratumNetwork) - **Price Change:** +619.376%, **Total Social Change:**+501.659%

[#9 XLM](/r/Stellar) - **Price Change:** +249.216%, **Total Social Change:**+501.642%

[#10 ARN](/r/AeronAero) - **Price Change:** +1020.204%, **Total Social Change:**+469.129%

[#11 ENG](/r/EnigmaCatalyst) - **Price Change:** +1162.809%, **Total Social Change:**+427.344%

[#12 MANA](/r/Dencentraland) - **Price Change:** +236.856%, **Total Social Change:**+393.404%

[#13 XRP](/r/Ripple) - **Price Change:** +812.067%, **Total Social Change:**+389.193%

[#14 ETN](/r/Electroneum) - **Price Change:** +60.470%, **Total Social Change:**+366.755%

[#15 QSP](/r/Quantstamp) - **Price Change:** +518.553%, **Total Social Change:**+346.401%

[#16 SALT](/r/SaltTrader) - **Price Change:** +76.836%, **Total Social Change:**+331.701%

[#17 AST](/r/AirSwap) **Price Change:** +561.384%, **Total Social Change:**+272.433%

[#18 THC](/r/TheHempCoin) - **Price Change:** +711.952%, **Total Social Change:**+265.797%

[#19 NULS](/r/NulsService) - **Price Change:** +587.179%, **Total Social Change:**+234.036%

[#20 QASH](/r/LiquidQash) - **Price Change:** +104.2105%, **Total Social Change:**+208.4238%

*Total social change => reddit and twitter growth

&nbsp;

It probably wouldn’t be the best decision to buy a coin based off just community growth, so Coinmunity pulls each coin’s full subreddit to make it easy to quickly research the coin and see if there is any upcoming big news. 

&nbsp;

**Some upcoming features that we think will add value:**

* Google trends

* Marketcap and volume rankings

* Track personal investments

&nbsp;

If you have an android, the app is currently in development, but I have made a mobile friendly web app that is available at https://coinmunity.co! I will announce on the Coinmunity [twitter](https://twitter.com/coinmunityapp) when it is completed.

&nbsp;

As Coinmunity continues to grow, I will start to collect more and more data on social activity surrounding these coins, such as retweets,comments, upvotes, etc. One relationship that I am looking forward to explore is the amount of exchanges a coin is available on vs social growth vs price growth. I think there is a sweet-spot before a coin is widely enough available to experience huge price jumps, where it would be the best time to buy a coin. If this is something you guys are interested in please let me know and I will continue to post each month about further discoveries from the data!

ADA,Altcoin,Why I think Stellar is gonna be the winner,"If you look at its growth, its sustained, it has its bubbles but compared to others it seems much more stable. It broke the top 10 this week, and should break into 9 in the next few days or week. Its backed by the company I work for IBM (i do not work on this project) which has lots of financial ties and is really into the financial and insurance industry. IBM has the number 3 cloud provider service in the world, and the transaction time is much faster than BTC/LTC/ETH. I think by years end it should be a top 5. I invest in XRP/ADA/XLM/0x/ and a few other long shots. I have much 4x as much cash in Ripple, and ADA but XLM seems more solid and lest bursty. If your looking for a great longterm, this one has all the markings of a successful stock. You should put some cash in it now. I traded out all my LTC and ETH this week and went all in on the non top 3 (then). ",13,2018-01-01 02:52:46,7

ADA,Altcoin,What is Cardano?,,24,2017-11-21 19:19:34,6
ADA,Altcoin,$100 into each of 5 coins,"Title gives the basics. I've done some extensive research and also already hodl some of these coins but I'm about to put in a fresh $500 investment. Here are the coins I've narrowed it down to, I can pick 5:

XMR
XRP
VTC
ARK
WAVES
XLM
ADA
NAV
NEO

any advice/sell me on your coin!

I am leaning towards: XLM, ADA, VTC, ARK, NAV",3,2017-12-18 04:13:21,7
ADA,Altcoin,Programs and wallet advice please,"Hi everyone, kinda a noob here, been doing light reading over the past few years and more recently, i was thinking of starting to invest in alt coins, not crazy but with BTC you never know. As usual i know everything can be unpredictable and understand the risk. I have been looking at SC, DOGE, SUB, EOS,XRP,XUC, QTUM, ADA, QASH, PHO AND DGB. i only mention these as this is what ive seen a few posts about, i will research more of course. My main question is what program and wallet to use. From what i have read, different wallets support different coins? are there any suggestions on what to use? Also would it be best to setup a bank account with an online bank rather than using my local bank details? Many thanks in advance. In work so will check back when i can",2,2017-12-07 10:05:07,7
ADA,Altcoin,Best Altcoins 2018,"HI Everyone, these are my altcoins for 2018. Curious on people's opinions:

CND Cindicator
TRX Tron
XLM Stellar Lumens
BRD Bread
ADA Cardano
IOTA MIOTA
SUB Substratum
XRP Ripple
BQX Ethos
AION AION

Question is which types of blockchain companies have the most upside for 2018. I am guessing companies that help make cryptocurrencies accessible to the general public ETHOS, BRD. Curious on people's thoughts.",6,2018-01-04 10:23:16,6
ADA,Altcoin,List of AltCoins Organized by Niche?,"I was wondering, is there any resource online where altcoins are grouped by Niche? (ie. ADA and Etherium would be under 'ecosystem', Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash would be under 'coins', Monero and Verge would be under 'Privacy Coin', Wabi would be under 'Supply Chain', etc.)

Wanted to invest long term (3-5 years) based on niche / solution of an altcoin, and something like this would really help. Trying to learn about all the different altcoins out there.",4,2017-12-29 16:48:42,6
ADA,Altcoin,"Alt coin sales, which to buy?","Hey guys I have $110 from swing trading the past couple hours, which altcoins should i get since a lot are down at the moment. XRP, ADA, XVG? I have trx already. ",1,2018-01-10 09:32:22,6

ADA,Altcoin,Best platform for HODLing?,"Hi everyone,

Been a long time lurker and just recently built up enough courage to buy some coins. I’m an engineer and firmly believe in the future of crypto currency, and I want to buy in on a few alt coins and hold on to them for a while. I’m using binance and coinbase currently, and have holdings of ADA and XRP. Is binance a good platform for holding for a long while? Or should I move them to a physical wallet... if a physical wallet is better can you make any recommendations on the best way to secure them for the long haul?",1,2017-12-19 01:02:55,6

ADA,Altcoin,How do I get started?,"Hey - I am very intrested in cryptocurrencies and all kinds of altcoins, but I don't know anyone who can show me the beginners ways I'd say of starting with investing in a couple coins. Now I've been watching YouTube videos about Ripple, ADA, Verge, etc which is very intresting. But I have some questions. How can I decide in what coin I should invest in? How much should I invest? How can u ""predict"" whats gonna happen with the coin? What are the use of some of these coins? (Also my motherlanguage isn't English so some of the words people use to describe their coin is quiet hard for me to understand so I need some explenation done in an easier way if possible haha ).

I hope someone can awnser my questions, also if this post isn't alloud here I'll just delete it and try somewhere else. Im just an 18y/o guy who want's to do it different",1,2017-12-30 22:54:56,5

ADA,Altcoin,Safe Wallets for Altcoins? Bittrex 25% fees to withdraw are maddening.,"Currently invested in a plethora of altcoins and am looking for a way to safely store them. I'm a little paranoid about Bittrex. Aside from the fact they charge a 25% withdraw fee from an altcoin, I know they dont insure anything and definitely dont boast about their security. Hoping you guys can help!

I am looking for any help / information on which wallets (that are safe or safer) accept these specific coins.

 There are more events but this message got too long",6,2018-04-04 14:08:41,2
ADA,Altcoin,Rate my alt coin portfolio!,"Hi All,

I switched from investing in just BTC/LTC/ETH, to adding in some other large marketcap coins, to then deciding that my favorite coins are less than 1 billion in marketcap as they still have a lot of room for organic growth.  I tried to put equal sums of money into each coin and I'm up a good amount with this portfolio, and there is still a lot of room for growth with most of these coins marketcaps.  I try to keep up with each coin, but it is more so focused on making sure they are meeting their objectives than following the FUD.  The only time I let go of one of these is when I feel that it would be impossible to return 10x gains in 1-2 years (I might drop ADA), when a team is underdelivering, or when I feel that the coin is overvalued based on future potential.  I make a FIAT deposit monthly and try and either invest in an interesting ICO, add to my position on a coin that is undervalued or invest in something new.  I made a good amount with ripple, but decided the chances it goes to 1 trillion within 1 year were much less likely than one of my other coins going from 300million to 3 billion so I decided to sell my entire position around 1 week ago.  I re-invested all of my ripple profits into this portfolio and it has paid off so far.  This portfolio allows me to manage risk and volatility while also seeing some pretty impressive gains.  Let me know your thoughts!

ADA,Altcoin,Wallet for a diverse portfolio?,"I have holdings in TRX, POE, XVG, DNT, CND, ADA, XLM, REQ, XRP, ELF and I was wondering if there's a universal wallet to hold all these coins?",3,2018-01-04 06:58:29,2
ADA,Altcoin,New to crytpos. Looking for advice,"I'm new to trading cryptos, and I'm open to any advice. Not looking to put in more than a couple hundred dollars. It's more for fun than earning money. A friend told me to buy Raiblocks (XRB) which I already did. Now I'm looking at things like XRP ADA XLM MIOTA. I like Ripple but I'm blown away by how big the market cap is already. With rumors of it being the next coin to go on Coinbase, does that make it any more promising? Also everything I read says ETH will keep going up. Any advice would be appreciated!",2,2018-01-03 19:50:27,2
ADA,Altcoin,Why did so many alts spike so much in December? Everything up 100s of percent?!?,"I'm looking at coinmarketcap and I see so many currencies that all just had enormous spikes all at the same time.   Ripple, RaiBlocks, Ven, Cardano, Iota..   every one of them gained at least 400%.  XRB and ADA went up like 30x!  If you pick any random currency in the top 50 or so, it's pretty much the same.

What is going on?  I recently got it, but after the big run up, but I'm getting cold feet looking at these graphs.  Currencies flat or slightly increasing for months and then they all just spike straight up at the exact same time?  Something feels fishy.  Can anyone explain this rationally?

ADA,Altcoin,I've invested a small amount in alts and I started thinking withdraw fees will drain my gains,"Hi guys!
I'm a newbie and i've decided a week ago to invest my first $100 in alts.
I split my pile equally in differents currencies on my binance wallet (eos, iota, omg, ada).
What worries me is that when I  will decide to withdraw my investment and turn it into my euro, I will lose a large part of the billet into withdraw fees.
(for istance : witdraw my 10 iota will cost to me 0.5, witthdraw my 20 Ada will cost 1 Ada, withdraw 3 Eos will cost me 0.7!!!).
Just wondering if i miss anything in the process, in the moment i will turn my alt in currency, i will loset an important part of my little gains.
Thank u",1,2017-12-28 11:36:35,2

ADA,Altcoin,"l""Cheap"" coins are not as cheap as they seem","We've just added feature to our comparison tool. You can compare coins by their levels of supply (either total or circulating). We normalise the price of the coin by removing unit bias. This feature gives you a good view of the coins that look ""cheap"" but are probably not as cheap as they seem.

E.g: We assume that ADA had the same circulating supply as BTC, and use the formula (ADA Supply / BTC supply * ADA Price) to remove unit bias. Under these conditions, ADA price would be $ 536. Matching by total supply, ADA price = $ 746

It's definitely not as cheap as it seemed. See more at: https://matchcoins.info/?c1=bitcoin&c2=cardano

I hope you'll find it useful. Any feedback is very welcome.",7,2018-02-05 13:19:46,0
ADA,Altcoin,(BLZ) Bluzelle - Simple rundown and analysis,"Bluzelle Investment Cheatsheet:

Token: (BLZ) Bluzelle

What is it?: Bluzelle combines the sharing economy with the token economy - renting individuals' computer storage space to earn tokens while dApp developers use tokens to have their dApp's data stored and managed.

ICO: $0.12 per token

SUPPLY: 165M Circulating

MCAP: 100M

Traditional Market Equivialnt: Oracle (200BN market cap)

Closest crypto competion: SiaCoin SC (700M market cap)

Team experience: Google, Microsoft, Disney, Ucla, Lufthansa, ZEROBLOCK.

Next big release: Minimum Viable Product April 18

History: Formed 2014, already served customers for markets in Smart Insurance, Cross Boarder Payments and KYC Shared Ledger. Partners include: Microsoft, BT, Ripple, Ethereum, Temenos, KPMG. 

Awards: Global Fintech 100, WEF Tech Pioneer 2017


!!UNIQUE INVESTMENT FACTORS!! The whitelist application period was cut short due to overwhelming demand. The ICO was sold with a tiny 0.6ETH Maximum Personal Cap.  This means that most were not able to buy the amount of Bluzelle they wanted, as the ICO sold out fast despite the max cap. 

This greatly reduces the potential for whale manipulation, the only way they can increase their stacks to attempt such a feat is to buy more BLZ on Binance. LOW RISK OF BEING DUMPED ON IN THE SHORT TERM!! Bonuses for private investors are locked and most of the remaining supply locked for 2-4years.

The tokens were unlocked today and immediately listed on Binance as their first exchange. I assume Binance doesn't just allow any coin/ico that pays a fee to list as they are under closer government scrutiny now so that is quite impressive. The last time I saw something similar was when ADA(Cardano) arrived seemingly out of nowhere and straight on to Bittrex at a time when nothing was being listed.

My personal expectation is for this project to reach a market cap of 200M without much issue. That would be roughly 2x the current value. That is being super conservative and I anticipate it at least moving close to the value of Sia which would be roughly 10x the current value.

ADA,Altcoin,ENG and QSP,"I picked ADA cardano as a good investment at around 0.03 cents and like a stupid idiot sold it when it went up to around 15 cents thinking I have done well. Since then I have made a few other stupid mistakes but have consistently been picking some nice winners such as Verge (although I am it a great fan of it). Now I am holding on to just two key coins for dear life and these are ENG and QSP. I do have a few other interesting ones in my kitty such as EtherLEND and some ICO based coins as well but ENG and QSP are my big favourites and I think both have a great future similar to ADA Cardano. Excellent team, great product and fantastic vision.",4,2018-01-07 10:44:18,0
ADA,Altcoin,Buy and Hold 100 Cryptocurrencies for 5 Years - Week 7 - $1726 USD gained,"It’s the 7th week since the experiment started and I’m still here! 🙂 The more time I spend checking the experiment and the more I realize how crazy and unstable It’s going to be.

In these past weeks a lot happened,from the South Korean ban, The Re-ban from China, CME but also some good news, as the long waited Lighintg Network, which allows Bitcoin to be transferred in a few seconds and with very low fees.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is at the moment $11,298.30 USD.  and the dominance is of 34.5%, a little improvement compared to the previous weeks.

The unrealized gain of the experiment is $1,726.46 USD or 0.15 BTC.
Only 11 Cryptocurrencies are in minus since the beginning of the experiment and 3 of them have a gain of over 1000%.

With an overall gain of 172.6 %, the 100 cryptocurrencies together (CryptoETF100) performed better than 72 cryptos from the ones I have.

Let’s talk about our Top5 cryptocurrencies.

Tron (TRX) is for the 4th week in a row the best gainer. Six weeks ago I bought 2500 TRX with $10.04.  2500 TRX are worth now $209.22, a gain of 1984.58 %

TRX just announced a new cooperation with Spacety and a few days ago it was listed on Bitfinex, one of the biggest exchange around. Justin Sun, also gave hints on a new exchange, will it be Kucoin?

Vechain (VEN) has been doing wonders, there is so much going on that it’s impossible to keep up! Just to mention afew, Breyer Capital has agreed to support VeChain through an official advisory role. They just announced a new cooperation with DNV GL and also with Sentinel Chain. When I bought it 7 weeks ago, I got with $10.11 USD , 18 (VEN), at the time the price was of $ 0.56 , right now the price is $7.27, so the 18 VEN is now worth $131.03  a major gain of 1195.52 %.

Verge (XVG) keeps up being on the 3rd position with an overall gain of 1008.82 % . It successfully hard forked and stealth tx’s are now being processed.

0x Protocol (ZRX) is now in the 4th position, what looked like momentum last week was only the beginning of a big rise. With the recent hack to the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, where it lost 523 mln NEM coins, approximately $534 mln. It only made clear to all of us the importance to have a decentralized exchange. Will 0x be the answer?

Lastly, on the 5th position, we have Cardano (ADA), the overall gain is of 519.78 %, was this rise given by the fact that Binance finally fixed the withdrawal issues?

Top 5 cryptocurrencies so far :

Tron (TRX)  +1563.45 % , from $10.04 to $166.95
VeChain (VEN) +1195.52 % , from 10.11  to $131.03
Verge (XVG)  +1008.82 % , from $9.62 to $106.67
Ox (ZRX) +734.19 % , from $9.99 to $66.72
Cardano (ADA) + 519.78 % , from $9.57 to $59.31

Worst 5 cryptocurrencies so far :

Next (NXT) -45.67 % , from $9.89 to $5.37
Mona (MONA)  -54.62 % , from $9.76 to $4.43
Pura (PURA) -54.76 % , from $9.62 to $4.35
Einsteinium (EMC2) -67.56 % , from $9.51 to $3.08
Bitconnect (BCC) -97.15 % , from $9.93 to $0.28

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Cardano looks like it is the next coin to make another leg up!! Remember like last cycle, every coin takes turns pumping. They don't all go up at the same time","It isn't letting me post pictures, but if you look at $ADA's chart and you can clearly see a bull flag formation. Obviously it could break to the down to the the .55 area, but in this bullish crypto environment I think that is very unlikely to happen. Honestly a break down to liquidate the longs then a pump to the .70 range seems like a probable scenario. I am looking forward to 2024 for all altcoins... maybe another defi summer like back in 2020 for the L1's that haven't had their defi boom yet...would be awesome. Let me know which way you think $ADA is going. Stay safe out there and best of luck this year!",3,2024-01-02 18:01:26,1
ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,📣CHARLES Token - Low buy fees (6%)?! Bridge to Cardano Network?! Easy 100X?! CG and CMC listing in progress?!📣,"Hello, thank you for taking a look at our post!

The CHARLES token has a yield-generate contract on BSC (Binance Smart Chain) where the token holders get rewarded in ADA (BEP20). The mechanism incentivizes token holders to hold in order to earn dividends from the transactions. In the early stages we wanted to pay tribute to Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano and offer an alternative way to earn ADA for Cardano stake pool delegators. Also create a token on BSC that can be trusted and the liquidity not to be rug-pulled during overnight and last but not least do good and give back to the community (supporting the holders/delegators).

In the medium term we want to provide farming and staking possibilities to our holders, and these advanced discussions have been taken forward.

For the long term we are working on a utility that is a bridge between BSC and Cardano Network. With this option our holders can decide to stake ADA in a Cardano stake pool, hold them on hot wallets or transfer them to Cardano Network. 
At BSC we want to focus on the bridge as it would be a great opportunity for everyone to be able to transfer their funds easily from one network to another.
On the Cardano network we want to deploy our real-life use case token with a decent holder base.

At the same time, the overall number of wallets increased by 1.19% to 4.07 million, while the number of delegated wallets increased only slightly by 0.06% to 1.28 million.  


Plutus scripts were up 3.53% throughout the specified period, reaching 5,419. There are currently 8.07 million native tokens in circulation, an increase of 2.63%.  


I remember how I was hyped when I bought my first CoinFantasy tokens and soon after ADA, so it's always nice to hear news like this.

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cardano beats Ethereum in the number of unique staking wallets,"In a tweet shared by Hoskinson today, the number of unique staking wallets on the Cardano Network surpasses Ethereum’s by a large margin.   


According to data shared by Hoskinson, the number of unique addresses staking on Cardano now sits at 1,234,810 (1.23M). where the number of unique staking participants’ wallets on the Ethereum blockchain is 88,400.  


Do you remember when Cardano achieved the feat days after crypto news outlet Cointelegraph published a false report about the ADA staking initiative? Last week, Cointelegraph reported that certain risks are associated with ADA staking, which include high transaction fees, possible loss of funds that may arise from the negligence of pool operators, etc. This did not sit well with Hoskinson, which prompted his reaction.  


Following the tremendous surge in the number of staking wallets on Cardano, it is evident that investors’ confidence in ADA staking is relatively high.  


I'm super hyped about ADA, right now what bothers me is that so-called [3ST](https://twitter.com/3SToken) Twitter account, no idea what’s going on but I heard there was a massive production happening in Dubai. So, I'll use this chance to ask you, does anyone know something about it?   


Meanwhile, ADA retail investors have been relatively active in recent times. According to IntoTheBlock data from Cardano-focused news outlet Cardano Feed, retail investors now hold 22.63 billion ADA, representing 66.73% of the cryptocurrency’s supply.",8,2023-04-03 16:16:07,2

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Do you believe Cardano has the potential to someday truly compete with Ethereum?,"Despite Cardano's dismal performance in comparison to its price in 2022, the smart contract platform saw a number of improvements.  


You undoubtedly recall when Vasil was introduced at Cardano in September to increase the cryptocurrency's scalability. This is due to the introduction of smart contracts, decentralized applications, and an increase in NFTs projects in cryptocurrency.  


Scalability is therefore required for projects to be able to stand out and for the cryptocurrency to be a strong rival for ETH in order to prevent Cardano from making the same mistakes as blockchains from earlier generations.  


Do you believe Cardano has the potential to someday truly compete with Ethereum, or as we like to say, ""kill"" Ethereum?  


As interest in the ADA network increases, these are some of the Cardano dApps that might be notable: Minswap succeeded in becoming Cardano's largest TVL because it got off to a strong start.  


What about JPG Store, Cardano's main selling point? The project is not only the top NFT on the ADA network, but it is also the Ethereum killer dApp with the biggest capitalization. Indigo Protocol is also cool, in my opinion.  


Elan Future was my biggest revelation this year, and I'm hoping that next year I'll discover some other interesting initiatives that are integrated into the Cardano ecosystem.  


What do you expect will happen to Cardano as a whole in 2023?",10,2022-12-29 20:52:00,3
ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cardano transaction volume exceeds 30 billion ADA,"According to IntoTheBlock, the volume of large transactions on the Cardano network this week returned to above 30 billion ADA. The last time this was seen was more than nine months ago.

It's important to keep in mind that while there have been more transactions overall, the number of transactions has stayed within normal ranges. This ADA volumetric data translate to a sum that is over $11 billion in financial terms. In the coming days, I'll defiantly keep an eye on ADA and consider my options with Flynt Finance because last time I had an experience that 1 BTC became 1.2 BTC in like 6 months.

As I found some info, it's interesting fact that on the same days that this local high in the index was reached, the price of ADA, Cardano's native token, showed high-amplitude price action.

Thus, after rebounding 8% from the $0.3 per ADA level seven days ago, the price managed to rise by another 11% and then fall by 13% in the first three days of the new week.

What are your expectations from ADA this year or in the following months?",8,2023-03-20 07:45:58,0
ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cardano could rank among the largest DeFi networks in the world if its ADA price reaches ATH,"Have you noticed how nearly every month, the Cardano network's TVL has increased by 20%?  


The TVL on the Cardano network recently shattered the previous peak and surpassed the ATH mark in ADA. This important milestone proves the Cardano network's DeFi ecosystem is thriving and expanding at a remarkable rate.  


A growing interest in the network's distinctive mechanisms and eUTxO model-based solutions is one factor contributing to the increase in TVL on the Cardano network. I'll continue using Toshi Tools to keep track of everything.  


According to some interesting info I've read, Cardano could rank among the largest DeFi networks in the world if its ADA price reaches ATH, which was seen in September 2021.  


In my opinion, this is a noteworthy accomplishment for a network that is relatively new to the DeFi industry.  


Also, as the Cardano network gains popularity, the DeFi ecosystem is attracting more users and programmers. The Cardano blockchain has already seen significant adoption from a number of blockchain projects that established their protocols on it.",9,2023-03-16 16:21:13,0

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cardano's new stablecoin could be a game changer,"Early in 2023, Cardano's first stablecoin backed by the USD will go live. According to a blog post, it will be the first of the finance products from EMURGO's 'Anzens' suite and is anticipated to add value to Cardano's Web3 ecosystem of decentralized applications.  


Cardano does not contain a stablecoin, in contrast to Ethereum. The problem is that the Cardano community needs to be able to ""offload their risk"" because the DeFi ecosystem is expanding.  


I'm hyped about this since I heard that the key factors that set USDA apart from other stablecoins are its placement on the Cardano blockchain and its significantly lower fees compared to other blockchain networks such as Ethereum.   


I'll definitely keep an eye more on Cardano, SHIB, and CoinFantasy this year, that's my to-do list.   


I found in one article: ""According to the company's current plan, Cardano will commence its efforts with the tokenization of US dollars, with the intention to later expand to tokenizing ""any type of real-world asset."" The technology developed for USDA is designed to work in conjunction with trusted financial institutions to digitize and tokenize assets, which can then be freely traded within the DeFi ecosystem. If a user wishes to redeem their tokens, they can return them to EMURGO, which will release the underlying asset and provide physical delivery if necessary.""  


This all sounds great, what do you think about the new coin, would all of this impact Cardano's price to rise?",7,2023-02-10 16:17:48,1

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,How did Cardano Vasil hard fork became a game changer for investors?," To get a better idea on [investing in cardano](https://app.adjust.net.in/6m5k691?campaign=Reddit&adgroup=Thread&creative=nonbranded), it's essential to look at how the Vasil upgrade directly translated to the influx of new users.

Currently, ADA’s circulation is fixed at 45 billion. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of the blockchain, already stated that there are [no foreseeable plans to increase that cap in the future](https://dailycoin.com/cardanos-ada-founder-charles-hoskinson-says-he-cannot-change-ada-supply-or-force-vasil-hard-fork/). 

Now, with Vasil increasing the number of developers coming into the network, this will directly translate to the token having a lower inflation rate and a higher demand.

In short, if you look into **Cardano investment** avenues now, the price may vary depending on the market projection. Yet, there's also the cushion of it not depreciating anytime soon. Part of this comes from the token’s involvement in several projects including NFTs. In fact, Shawn Du’Mmett, a former IT consultant and  blockchain researcher, [has an article](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-price-prediction/) that elaborates on how ADA will see an incremental rise in prices.

Besides, since the network's Smart Contracts are being completely overhauled, users will experience a range of benefits, including lower transaction fees and faster block progression. That could also increase the interest around the network.",1,2022-10-25 09:15:57,5

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cardano founder smashes Ethereum again.,"Hoskinson continues to push the differences between Cardano and Ethereum proof-of-stake (PoS).

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson today compared Cardano delegation transactions to fake transactions after the mutual fund operator (SPO) emphasized that it does not consume any network bandwidth.

“You could almost say these are Ghost transactions,” Hoskinson tweeted.

It is worth noting that a tweet from Rick McCracken of DIGI stake pools highlights that the number of delegations on the network has exceeded 1.2 million. According to McCracken, as a result, about 1.2 million transactions occur on the network every five days without using bandwidth at the equivalent rate of 4 transactions per second. In conclusion, SPO doubts that this is something that Ethereum will ever be able to replicate.

Cardano, some blockchain platforms like Ovenue, DigiFt along with GameFi seem to be on the rise of crypto and will hopefully pull others forward, whatever their differences and which side you take.

Notably, in the days following Ethereum's merger, Hoskinson made it his mission to push the differences between Ethereum's PoS implementation and Cardano's. Recently, Cardano's founder likened Ethereum to the ""Hotel California of crypto"" as he expressed concern over the lack of clarity about when users would be able to access their Ethereum staked in an Ethereum staking contract.",8,2022-09-28 00:35:12,4

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"2030 Coin Prediction: Cardano (ADA) Leads Twitter Polls by 82%, Will It Really Be The Biggest Of The Lot?","CoinQuora reported earlier today on the Twitter poll by the crypto community on May 18, 2022, where ADA leads by quite some margin getting 82% of votes over three other altcoins. 

 A Twitter user with 26.7k followers ran a poll requesting people to vote for the coin they believe will remain until 2030. Along with ADA, they listed Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Algorand (ALGO). At the time of writing, 12,983 Twitter users voted. 82% of the respondents favored Cardano’s ADA, while only 3% picked Avalanche.  But some of the guys replying to the post expressed zero confidence in the four listed tokens. Citing the disastrous implosion of Terra (LUNA). 

They said their conviction remains with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).  While it is impractical to tell which coin is the next Bitcoin, experts have parameters in place to vet the sustainability of a crypto project.

 The sustainability of a coin may be from its use cases, team, web presence, community, etc.  Nonetheless, every cryptocurrency has a reason to exist. It may exist as a payment method like USDC, or a utility token, like Solana, to verify transactions on a blockchain or a reward token like $Solis which is used to return value to content creators.

 The idea is that an absence of a use case for a coin strongly indicates something fishy. Do you think ADA is right up there?",0,2022-05-20 19:31:13,9

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cardano Foundation and The University of Zurich expand academic blockchain research,"The university will use Cardano’s insights to conduct further research on blockchain-related topics.

Non-profit organization Cardano Foundation has announced a three-year collaboration with the Blockchain Center of the University of Zurich (UZH BCC) to further research initiatives and explore blockchain education development. 

Through the partnership, the foundation will work with the Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (BDLT) Group at the University of Zurich to explore research topics like the efficacy of consensus protocols and analyze attack vectors specific to Ouroboros, among many others. 

According to Cardano Foundation CEO Frederik Gregaard, the partnership allows the foundation to provide information to UZH BCC to expand the university's knowledge of the Cardano platform and at the same time, further develop Cardano itself. Gregaard also explained that: 

“As blockchain moves from the margins to the mainstream, considerably more academic research is required to enhance understanding and, ultimately, bring about adoption. This is why we have even specifically called out education as a core goal of the Foundation for the year ahead.” 
Dr. Claudio Tessone, a professor at the UZH, believes that the partnership will be beneficial to the UZH, and Cardano Foundation’s input is “invaluable to the co-creation of research questions and methodologies,” said Tessone.

Today I would like to present you my current favorite project on the Ada network, ASHIB!

First of all I would like to mention that my investment has already increased by 500% since the launch a few days ago!

On a mission to build another cryptocurrency icon next to Ethereum’s Shiba Inu, A SHIB enters the scene as one of the first three tokens on the Cardano network. Furthermore, A SHIB will be officially the first shib token on the ADA network, and it is planning to hit the market in the coming months. A SHIB aims to be as successful, if not even more, as the flagship meme token on the Ethereum network. A SHIP will be using low gas fees and Cardano’s Extended UTXO model to rapidly gain traction in the industry. ",6,2022-01-25 11:23:32,8

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cardano Could See a Breakout Leading Up to the Vasil Hard Fork: Anyone Got Same Thoughts?,"Crypto influencer, Dan Gambardello, posted in a tweet on June 8 why he is waiting for a Cardano (ADA) breakthrough soon.  One of the first items he mentioned was that the ADA’s Vasil Hard Fork is just around the corner. In addition to this, Gambardello also observed an ascending triangle pattern on ADA’s chart.  The triangle is starting to reach its apex, but the most significant thing about this for Gambardello is that the apex is “basically wrapping around the Vasil Hard Fork” at the end of June.  Gambardello also mentioned the fact that ADA is busy testing the $0.647 resistance and is closing daily candles above the 20-day moving average.  Another significant aspect for the influencer is that the interest in Cardano is on the increase.


 The crypto space seems to have a bullish sentiment towards the crypto and a number of whales have also been stocking up on tokens like Shib, Mana, Solis and also ADA.  Gambardello concluded by acknowledging that anything can still happen, but that he thinks that the crypto market and even traditional markets are positioned for a rally if everything falls right.  He also stated that he is not trying to make a prediction about ADA, but rather referring to the consistent data that ADA has produced throughout its past.   What could be your prediction?",9,2022-06-09 19:03:45,3

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis: What Should We Expect in the Next 48 Hours? Do you see a bullish trend after this?,"
Cardano (ADA) is a third-generation, decentralized proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform like Solana, Concordium and PolkaDot, designed to be a more efficient alternative to proof-of-work (PoW) networks. Scalability, interoperability, and sustainability on PoW networks like Ethereum are impeded by the infrastructure burden of growing costs, energy use, and slow transaction times.

Cardano (ADA) is ranked number 8 in CoinMarketCap’s list of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap. ADA experienced a 24-hour gain of 3.06% to take its price up to $0.4737. This also settles its total market cap at roughly $15.95 billion. ADA has seen an increase in its total 24-hour trading volume as the figure now stands at $845,606,302 which is a 25.24% rise over the last day.

CoinQuora’s post earlier today showed that ADA’s price has recently broken above the 9 and 20 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines as can be seen from the daily chart above. This comes after ADA’s price closed the last four out of five days in the green, leading to a multi-day positive sequence. The last red candle was yesterday as the 9 and 20 EMA lines tried a last-stitch effort to keep ADA’s price down.",1,2022-07-19 20:16:55,2
ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and Cardano (ADA) Lead Altcoins Charge As 2021 Closes Its Curtains","[https://btcmanager.com/solana-sol-polkadot-dot-cardano-ada-altcoin-2021/](https://btcmanager.com/solana-sol-polkadot-dot-cardano-ada-altcoin-2021/)

Solana (SOL) has recorded high entries from its developers lately, surpassing the submission rates of [DOT](https://btcmanager.com/will-polkadot-and-huh-token-become-the-favourite-altcoins/) and ADA on Github. Per data from Santiment, Solana has had about 97 development entries on Github today. Cardano and Polkadot closely follow Solana in the year-end development activity analysis.

**Altcoins Increase Their Development Entries**

Per an analysis from crypto data tracker Santiment, Solana, Cardano, Polkadot, Ethereum, and Chainlink have recorded a lot of development activities lately. Solana has had quite a run this year, which saw it breaching its ATH and rank among the top 10 cryptos. 

The Q4 of 2021 started with meager daily development activities in the large-cap coins. On OCT. 29, 2021, almost all top 10 coins had less than ten development activities. Their development teams started incorporating new technologies, and the daily submission rates crawled back to normal. These developments are a good signal heading to the next year as some of the altcoins networks’ activities signal the crypto market’s anticipation for 2022.

**Solana Eclipses Daily Development Activities of Other Large Cap Cryptos**

In June 2021, Polkadot and Cardano had very high Github development submission rates. Both of these coins had more than 60 daily entries each. At the same time, Solana only had fewer than 50 daily entries. The two coins maintained the lead in daily development submissions on the github, while major cryptos had little to no activities in matters development. Nonetheless, the other digital currencies started registering a spike in their daily submission rates in Mid-August.

The daily developments were reduced by August but resumed vigorously in September. The whole of September was a busy month for developers as the daily submission rates for most coins were very high. At this time, ETH, DOT, and [ADA](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl) were the leader as SOL followed closely behind. It was not till towards Mid-October that the daily developments reduced.

After the number of development submissions on Github started rising in November, the Solana team began dominating. Their submissions rates competed with [DOT](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) and ADA. [SOL](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases) overtook ADA on NOV. 18 and almost caught up with DOT five days later. However, SOL came to overtake DOT on DEC. 11, 2021. Today, SOL has 97submissions while DoT has 77. ADA also follows closely with 66 submissions.

Our *HODL* rewards are out of this world with weekly giveaway and huge milestone giveaways, 4% burn and 2% reflections, not to mention ***high APY yield farming*** planned. 🤑Get ready to stake it in and rake it in!🤑

We're striving to be one of the most prominent utility tokens in the crypto sphere. Our upcoming launchpad will be the first of it's kind, providing low-barrier tiers and allocation opportunities to the most casual of investors, as well as additional staking options. With our push for ***cross-chain compatibility with Cardano***, who are releasing their smart contract capabilities within weeks, this is an 💥explosive opportunity🤯

**We're audited by Certik**, the most respected and sought after auditors in the industry. When we say utility we're not kidding around, Pumpswap and NFT's are also in our  future. The hibernation period of the bear market has ended and we are ready to start this quarter off with a bang! This low market cap with high liquidity gem won't be low for long. We have more opportunities to offer $PUMP holders, with an *upcoming airdrop and seed sale as well for our platform's governance token*. DO NOT miss your chance to get on board before we breach the atmosphere.🚀We're shooting for the stars🌟

When searching for the perfect platform to launch $PUMP, what our community needed did not exist. $PUMP did not want to offer their community only a tiny chance at an allocation with an expensive buy-in, with huge participation restrictions, but rather open the investment opportunity to everyone who wanted to participate. $PUMP realized the need for a community driven IDO/ICO launchpad. This realization became the driving force for our primary project ambition. A comprehensive tokenomics model was created to support growth of the technology, the community, the team, and the token.

Looking forward to seeing you on the main deck everyone! Join our TG for more info on the progress of these developments, and ***don't miss your chance to invest before we 100x+!***

# $PUMP Utility Token

&#x200B;

MoonPump is a community-driven project that is set to disrupt the IDO space. Alongside the recent bull run the IDO space has exploded. Sure, it’s been great to be a part of and get onboard projects that have seen 1000X gains. However, the MoonPump community was tired of all the associated fees that the IDO platforms and their launchpads charged in order to list or invest in a project.

Invest in the IDO platform by holding their tokens to then have to invest again in a project just does not make sense.

Therefore, with an ever-growing community they decided to change the game. Currently under development is an easily accessible, transparent, and zero-cost platform where, in turn, token holders are rewarded by being given early access to the projects set to be launched.

Moondano is the next big reward token that will reward you automatically with pegged ADA tokens just by holding. The project was just launched, so this is your chance to be early for the next moonshot. There is a sweepstake whitelist competition to avoid a botted presale.

Whitelist link: [https://sweepwidget.com/view/26868-16ufobtx](https://sweepwidget.com/view/26868-16ufobtx)

We are also holding a small private presale currently which is 15% cheaper than the public presale price to raise funds for marketing and project related expenses.

Moondano will be your next Moonshot and by massively increasing in value and rewarding you with pegged ADA tokens this is an absolute no brainer to get into.

We are planning to airdrop holders of our token actual ADA tokens once ADA smart contracts are introduced.

We plan to launch our own DEX platform and token just like Pancakeswap on BSC.

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,💡KubeCoin | The cryptocurrency for leisure and travel🛫 | Built on Cardano 🌐| But what is our story❓,"**What is KubeCoin?**

KubeCoin is the up-and-coming cryptocurrency that is revolutionizing the travel and leisure industries. It is universally adoptable and built on Cardano’s blockchain. Our decentralized DeFi token has been designed to provide a high utility layer to our KubeCoin Ecosystem, to become our exchangeable currency and as a rewards tool to give back to our loyal customers. 

**How it started**

However, this is not the beginning of our KubeCoin story. This remarkable cryptocurrency is actualizable due to the success of FlyKube and EatKube, our other verticals that have a surprise concept. FlyKube was founded in 2017 when our mission was to transform the way in which travellers perceive leisure activities through surprise experiences. Since its creation 4 years ago, we have become the go-to surprise holiday provider in 7 of the biggest European markets. Thanks to this success (5 million revenue, 300+ travellers, and 375,000 Venture Capital), our company can support modern technology and our current and future lines of business and therefore the next step was to create the Kube Group, which includes KubeCoin!

**Why we created KubeCoin**

With the KubeCoin model focusing on maximizing scalability and profitability, management and operational costs can be reduced. Our company’s goals and what is to be achieved moving forward are expressed through the implementation of our token. KubeCoin’s positive presence in the industry aims to create a more personal link between our platform and our users. At KubeCoin, customer satisfaction is key, and creating this cryptocurrency ensures that it remains a high standard. Introducing Kube Swap, an interactive swap exchange platform and our referral program encourages a constant flow of our coin. At the same time, it helps us reward customers for their involvement. 

**Presale details** 

Overall, there will be 480,000,000 tokens minted and allocated. 16% of our KubeCoin tokens will be issued to the presale and this amounts to 76,800,000 tokens, which will be divided between the three phases. Collectively, we decided that the presale was a very important step in establishing our brand within the cryptocurrency industry, and that is why a large number of our tokens will be available within the early stages of our project. The first phase of our presale successfully launched on 27th September 2021. We are extremely proud of the great progress and success which has come from this first phase. The launch of this phase is only the beginning as we have two more rounds in our presale, the early adopters round, and the community engagers round!

**The second round of our presale**

The second (Early Adopters) round will be launching on the **3rd November 2021.** We cannot wait to bring our users such a highly functional and universal token, which can be used on our platform and that of our global premium partners in order to purchase and to reward our users. 

The details of our second phase are as follows:

Price of each token: 0.05€/KC

Purchase limits:€500 minimum and €50K maximum

Nº of tokens:19.200.000

To participate, it is the same process as before! Create an account on our website, submit the KYC verification and after it is approved by our team you are ready to invest!

This is a great opportunity for us here at KubeCoin and we are extremely excited to share it with everyone! We are glad to have you as part of this project and we hope to see you on 3/11/2021 during our second phase!

**If you have any questions, contact us on our social media and we will be happy to help!**

**We're audited by Certik**, the most respected and sought after auditors in the industry.   
[https://www.certik.org/projects/moonpump](https://www.certik.org/projects/moonpump)  


Our utility goals are absolutely massive. Staking and yield farming are being worked on, with future plans to introduce Pumpswap as well as an NFT marketplace! The most important utility is the access $PUMP holders have to our upcoming launchpad ***Crypto Crowd Fund.*** For the first time, people from any economic background will have unbiased access to truly affordable low-barrier tiers, with no restrictions. $PUMP holders will have ecosystem privileges such as first access, voting rights, staking and farming rewards, and an allocation of project tokens for any project on the platform. The current launchpad industry standard for pricing of tiers, inherently excludes a huge percentage of investors in the crypto market who are without large financial backing. We are here to shatter that industry standard by including the large amount of casual investors that have been excluded for so long 💥   


Another one of our biggest plans is a ***partnership with Cardano***, who are just days away from releasing their smart-contract capabilities on the 12th of September! This cross-chain migration will allow us to launch projects from both BSC and Cardano, as well as being accessible to both blockchains community of investors! So rather than staying in a single lane of projects and investors we’ll have access to multiple lanes, allowing us to cover more ground and gain better traction with a larger portion of the traffic on the crypto market highway 🚀 This combined with our revolutionary inclusionary approach, will launch the $PUMP platform into the crypto spotlight as an IDO/ICO titan 🔥

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Devs with real world experience in the realm of crypto is monumental for anyone looking for a new project. Stellar XLM, Gemini, and Coin Telegraph are projects involving the team behind a new IDO Pumplaunch. In June this amazing project and cross-chain partnership with Cardano will come to fruition!","# [Yahoo Finance Article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pumplaunch-making-idos-accessible-everyone-140000071.html)

# [Business Insider Article](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/pumplaunch-making-idos-accessible-to-everyone-1030500171)

#    Up until now, only the big fish could access IDOs and make a ton of money. Now the new kid on the block, PumpLaunch, swings open the doors to everyone. A new project emerged in May that has already attracted  intense attention from the crypto community. Before even going live, MoonPump a.k.a. $PUMP (PumpLaunch's token) attracted over 30k twitter users and 25k  telegram followers, in days. The evident hype stems  from the fact that PumpLaunch lets people participate in Initial DEX  Offerings with no barriers and no minimum buy-ins. Everyone now has the unprecedented opportunity to make money from crypto projects during their earliest stages. 

 

$PUMP will create a new category-defining crosschain IDO platform, PumpLaunch. Not only will the platform tailor to the specific needs of each individual project launched, but $PUMP fills in the current market  gap by connecting more investors to each project it launches. PumpLaunch provides full bespoke service from start to finish for every  launch while providing all $PUMP holders, regardless of allocation, access to incredible crypto projects.

PumpLaunch invites all holders to participate without minimum buy-ins or restrictions. As long as the user holds $PUMP, they can access an allocation of every project on PumpLaunch. This community driven platform excludes no one and provides unbiased access to tokens before  they moon.  
 In addition to IDO accessibility, $PUMP holders receive ecosystem  privileges such as first access, voting rights, staking rewards, and an allocation of project tokens.

What separates $PUMP from the rest? Built on the Binance Smart Chain,  $PUMP offers accessibility, low gas fees, and easy access. $PUMP also  offers proper utility and initially will focus all time, energy, and  money on the IDO Platform.

After launching on the Binance Smart Chain $PUMP will eventually migrate over to the Cardano testnet, making $PUMP available on both chains. PUMPLAUNCH is the launchpad the world has been waiting for, built for the people.

🔸 *Every week a $PUMP holder doesn't sell, you gain entries into our* ***WEEKLY Sunday Giveaways***, *comprised of huge tech and/or crypto prizes. These prizes are based on the trading volume that week and will become quite large down the line.*

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cardano Price Prediction - ADA Going to $10 or $1 (Full Analysis)," Cardano (ADA) has officially become the largest crypto holding in my portfolio across all platforms. I am a believer in the technology, the team/developers behind it, the fiercely loyal community led by Charles Hoskinson, etc. Look forward to the Cardano Summit news and more catalysts ahead. Giving back the one way I can – creating more content! Let me know if you find it helpful, plan to make more.

# $PUMP Utility Token

MoonPump is a community-driven project that is set to disrupt the IDO space. Alongside the recent bull run the IDO space has exploded. Sure, it’s been great to be a part of and get onboard projects that have seen 1000X gains. However, the MoonPump community was tired of all the associated fees that the IDO platforms and their launchpads charged in order to list or invest in a project.

Invest in the IDO platform by holding their tokens to then have to invest again in a project just does not make sense.

Therefore, with an ever-growing community they decided to change the game. Currently under development is an easily accessible, transparent, and zero-cost platform where, in turn, token holders are rewarded by being given early access to the projects set to be launched.

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cardano Price Analysis: Cardano Awaits A Range Breakout For 40% Upswing," Cardano anticipates a breakout from a range of two key moving averages (50 SMA and 100SMA) in the 12-hour chart.

PumpLaunch Solves This Issue While Bridging The Cardano And BSC Networks!,"# Bringing to you the CARDANO and BSC IDO Revolution, PumpLaunch, as seen on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pumplaunch-making-idos-accessible-everyone-140000071.html?guccounter=1) and [Business Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/pumplaunch-making-idos-accessible-to-everyone-1030500171)!

It's not just about gains, it's about the future. When Sean and his development team viewed the current IDO platforms, he noticed a problem. They all wanted you to purchase a hefty amount of tokens in order to have even the opportunity to create something. Why? Because these platforms didn't share the vision of the future, where everything and everyone has a token to call their own, true financial freedom and the truly free market.

&#x200B;

Do you know who believes that is the future, who envisions it as such? **CZ himself**, right out of his mouth. If he knew what this team was doing, that they were sharing this revolutionary idea that would make his vision into a reality, he would be shilling this himself. [$PUMP'](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x5610bf2bf5abe5750bdbce311631dee2afa2cd24)s IDO known as PumpLaunch, is trying to create a platform for **EVERYONE**.

&#x200B;

Most of the people who bought in the presale held their allocations and are eager to see this project develop. This morning when I woke up, I was pleasantly surprised to see people who used to spread FUD about this project to finally convert and become avid $PUMP supporters.

&#x200B;

Besides the chance to claim allocations, no matter the amount of [$PUMP](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x5610bf2bf5abe5750bdbce311631dee2afa2cd24) you hold, you also get a chance to participate in the weekly tech giveaways.

Discussion:

MOONPUMP $PUMP Utility Token - MoonPump is a community-driven project that is set to disrupt the IDO space. Alongside the recent bull run we have seen the IDO space explode. Sure, it’s been great to be a part of and get onboard projects that have seen 1000X gains. However, our community was tired of all the associated fees that the IDO platforms and their launchpads charged in order to list or invest in a project.

&#x200B;

Invest in the IDO platform by holding their tokens to then have to invest again in a project just did not make sense to us.

&#x200B;

Therefore, with an ever-growing community we decided to change the game. Currently under development is an easily accessible, transparent, and zero-cost platform where, in turn, token holders are rewarded by given early access to the projects to be launched.

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cardano transaction volume exceeds 30 billion ADA,"According to IntoTheBlock, the volume of large transactions on the Cardano network this week returned to above 30 billion ADA. The last time this was seen was more than nine months ago.

It's important to keep in mind that while there have been more transactions overall, the number of transactions has stayed within normal ranges. This ADA volumetric data translate to a sum that is over $11 billion in financial terms. In the coming days, I'll defiantly keep an eye on ADA and consider my options with Flynt Finance because last time I had an experience that 1 BTC became 1.2 BTC in like 6 months.

As I found some info, it's interesting fact that on the same days that this local high in the index was reached, the price of ADA, Cardano's native token, showed high-amplitude price action.

Thus, after rebounding 8% from the $0.3 per ADA level seven days ago, the price managed to rise by another 11% and then fall by 13% in the first three days of the new week.

What are your expectations from ADA this year or in the following months?",8,2023-03-20 07:45:58,0
ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cardano could rank among the largest DeFi networks in the world if its ADA price reaches ATH,"Have you noticed how nearly every month, the Cardano network's TVL has increased by 20%?  


The TVL on the Cardano network recently shattered the previous peak and surpassed the ATH mark in ADA. This important milestone proves the Cardano network's DeFi ecosystem is thriving and expanding at a remarkable rate.  


A growing interest in the network's distinctive mechanisms and eUTxO model-based solutions is one factor contributing to the increase in TVL on the Cardano network. I'll continue using Toshi Tools to keep track of everything.  


According to some interesting info I've read, Cardano could rank among the largest DeFi networks in the world if its ADA price reaches ATH, which was seen in September 2021.  


In my opinion, this is a noteworthy accomplishment for a network that is relatively new to the DeFi industry.  


Also, as the Cardano network gains popularity, the DeFi ecosystem is attracting more users and programmers. The Cardano blockchain has already seen significant adoption from a number of blockchain projects that established their protocols on it.",8,2023-03-16 16:21:13,0

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"2030 Coin Prediction: Cardano (ADA) Leads Twitter Polls by 82%, Will It Really Be The Biggest Of The Lot?","CoinQuora reported earlier today on the Twitter poll by the crypto community on May 18, 2022, where ADA leads by quite some margin getting 82% of votes over three other altcoins. 

 A Twitter user with 26.7k followers ran a poll requesting people to vote for the coin they believe will remain until 2030. Along with ADA, they listed Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Algorand (ALGO). At the time of writing, 12,983 Twitter users voted. 82% of the respondents favored Cardano’s ADA, while only 3% picked Avalanche.  But some of the guys replying to the post expressed zero confidence in the four listed tokens. Citing the disastrous implosion of Terra (LUNA). 

They said their conviction remains with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).  While it is impractical to tell which coin is the next Bitcoin, experts have parameters in place to vet the sustainability of a crypto project.

 The sustainability of a coin may be from its use cases, team, web presence, community, etc.  Nonetheless, every cryptocurrency has a reason to exist. It may exist as a payment method like USDC, or a utility token, like Solana, to verify transactions on a blockchain or a reward token like $Solis which is used to return value to content creators.

 The idea is that an absence of a use case for a coin strongly indicates something fishy. Do you think ADA is right up there?",0,2022-05-20 19:31:13,9

I would say that is unquestionably a good indication!,"Cryptocurrencies have outperformed practically every other financial asset, and with enough research, you can identify important price points to enter and begin increasing your portfolio.  


Interesting fact is that Cardano and Solana are often searched on the internet, and cryptocurrency investors are buying enormous numbers of these tokens, suggesting that both cryptos might help their investors make a lot of money in 2022.  


Do you believe Cardano will have a successful year?  


Keep in mind that activity on the Cardano blockchain is picking fast, with 400 new projects in the works and 100,000 new wallets established in the last month.  


I've been hearing lately that we should keep a watch on Cardano or this new cryptocurrency - Unicoins, since these two are about to skyrocket.  


Did you notice that there's been a lot of buzz regarding ADA lately? That is unquestionably a good indication!  


ADA has acquired great acceptance and has lately witnessed a significant price increase. The rising demand for ADA provides a chance to participate in the next crypto bubble. What are your thoughts about that?",3,2022-05-08 19:36:27,5

first of all we would like to thank you for reading our post!


🟢The CHARLES token 🟢 has a yield-generate contract on BSC (Binance Smart Chain) where the token holders get rewarded in ADA (BEP20). The mechanism incentivizes token holders to hold in order to earn dividends from the transactions. In the early stages we wanted to pay tribute to Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano and offer an alternative way to earn ADA for Cardano stake pool delegators. Also create a token on BSC that can be trusted and the liquidity not to be rug-pulled during overnight and last but not least do good and give back to the community (supporting the holders/delegators).
We have a working dashboard where you can track the reward pool and your actual shares from it without wallet connection!

In the medium term we want to provide farming and staking possibilities to our holders, and these advanced discussions have been taken forward.

For the long term we are working on a utility that is a bridge between BSC and Cardano Network. With this option our holders can decide to stake ADA in a Cardano stake pool, hold them on hot wallets or transfer them to Cardano Network. 
At BSC we want to focus on the bridge as it would be a great opportunity for everyone to be able to transfer their funds easily from one network to another.
On the Cardano network we want to deploy our real-life use case token with a decent holder base.

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis: What Should We Expect in the Next 48 Hours? Do you see a bullish trend after this?,"
Cardano (ADA) is a third-generation, decentralized proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform like Solana, Concordium and PolkaDot, designed to be a more efficient alternative to proof-of-work (PoW) networks. Scalability, interoperability, and sustainability on PoW networks like Ethereum are impeded by the infrastructure burden of growing costs, energy use, and slow transaction times.

Cardano (ADA) is ranked number 8 in CoinMarketCap’s list of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap. ADA experienced a 24-hour gain of 3.06% to take its price up to $0.4737. This also settles its total market cap at roughly $15.95 billion. ADA has seen an increase in its total 24-hour trading volume as the figure now stands at $845,606,302 which is a 25.24% rise over the last day.

CoinQuora’s post earlier today showed that ADA’s price has recently broken above the 9 and 20 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines as can be seen from the daily chart above. This comes after ADA’s price closed the last four out of five days in the green, leading to a multi-day positive sequence. The last red candle was yesterday as the 9 and 20 EMA lines tried a last-stitch effort to keep ADA’s price down.",1,2022-07-19 20:16:55,2
ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and Cardano (ADA) Lead Altcoins Charge As 2021 Closes Its Curtains","[https://btcmanager.com/solana-sol-polkadot-dot-cardano-ada-altcoin-2021/](https://btcmanager.com/solana-sol-polkadot-dot-cardano-ada-altcoin-2021/)

Solana (SOL) has recorded high entries from its developers lately, surpassing the submission rates of [DOT](https://btcmanager.com/will-polkadot-and-huh-token-become-the-favourite-altcoins/) and ADA on Github. Per data from Santiment, Solana has had about 97 development entries on Github today. Cardano and Polkadot closely follow Solana in the year-end development activity analysis.

**Altcoins Increase Their Development Entries**

Per an analysis from crypto data tracker Santiment, Solana, Cardano, Polkadot, Ethereum, and Chainlink have recorded a lot of development activities lately. Solana has had quite a run this year, which saw it breaching its ATH and rank among the top 10 cryptos. 

The Q4 of 2021 started with meager daily development activities in the large-cap coins. On OCT. 29, 2021, almost all top 10 coins had less than ten development activities. Their development teams started incorporating new technologies, and the daily submission rates crawled back to normal. These developments are a good signal heading to the next year as some of the altcoins networks’ activities signal the crypto market’s anticipation for 2022.

**Solana Eclipses Daily Development Activities of Other Large Cap Cryptos**

In June 2021, Polkadot and Cardano had very high Github development submission rates. Both of these coins had more than 60 daily entries each. At the same time, Solana only had fewer than 50 daily entries. The two coins maintained the lead in daily development submissions on the github, while major cryptos had little to no activities in matters development. Nonetheless, the other digital currencies started registering a spike in their daily submission rates in Mid-August.

The daily developments were reduced by August but resumed vigorously in September. The whole of September was a busy month for developers as the daily submission rates for most coins were very high. At this time, ETH, DOT, and [ADA](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl) were the leader as SOL followed closely behind. It was not till towards Mid-October that the daily developments reduced.

After the number of development submissions on Github started rising in November, the Solana team began dominating. Their submissions rates competed with [DOT](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) and ADA. [SOL](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases) overtook ADA on NOV. 18 and almost caught up with DOT five days later. However, SOL came to overtake DOT on DEC. 11, 2021. Today, SOL has 97submissions while DoT has 77. ADA also follows closely with 66 submissions.

EarnADA also has many other unique features in their tokenomics:

Whale Protection: no wallet can hold more than 2.5% of the initial supply

Dump Protection: No wallet can sell more than 0.5% of the initial supply at once and sellers get locked for 30 minutes before they can sell again.

There is a 20% tax on each transaction: 5% Ada reflection 1and 5% Auto LP that gets autolocked into the contract.

ADA can be claimed either on BSCscan or by sending less than 1 EADA to any address. The devs are working actively to quickly push out a working dApp to make it easier to claim your ADA.

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,This Technical Formation Could Cause 20% Increase For ADA: Anyone Got Same Observations?,"
The price of Cardano has formed a triple tap setup. This move is very similar to a triple bottom, but there are a few differences. According to CoinQuora, this technical formation from ADA does not have all the swing lows along the same line but has three very unique lows with the central low being much deeper than the others. Usually, a trend like this could signal a reversal in trend favouring the bulls if it forms after a downtrend and we’ve seen that with some tokens like Coin98, Concordium, Compound lately.

In the case of Cardano, this move could push up the price by 20% from its current price to trade at $0.550. If ADA’s bullish tempo continues, the price could reach the nest level at $0.628. This is why it is very important for investors to carefully watch ADA’s reaction to the $0.443 to $0.459 four-hour damned zone.

This triple tap setup for ADA will be invalidated if the price of Cardano closes a four-hour candlestick below the $0.435 support level. 

A recovery rally will only be possible if the ADA price can very quickly recover above this level. If this does not happen, ADA may risk a 12% drop in price to retest the immediate support level at $0.380.

&nbsp;

**Educational**


We will create platforms capable of educating the masses on crypto investment – with videos, content creation and examples of common technical analysis (such as RSI, or Bollinger Bands).
Our platforms will even contain content that teaches new investors about different contract types, how they function and simple coding knowledge to avoid rugs, honeypots and all other forms of scam.
Advanced knowledge and learning can be bought on our platforms – the proceeds from which will be reinvested into $WLV.
Ever wanted to learn about futures trading? How about how to make your money work for you in the background? If so, then our platforms are for you!

&nbsp;

**NFT's**

We are developing new and exciting NFTs – the profits from all NFTs will be put into liquidity, pushing the price higher the more they are bought and sold!

&nbsp;

**Charity**

Under our tokenomics model, part of the received funds will be used for the preservation of animals and wildlife – large donations made under the name of the project! Be part of the movement!

&nbsp;

**MARKETING**

&nbsp;

We’ll give you what you want! We have Influencers, low taxes and giveaways on launch, with massive plans to take this to $100,000,000 and more!

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"EarnDoge (EDOGE) has launched, inspired by eADA (EarnADA) great success, we now want to go for one of the more traded coins out there.","Earn Doge in rewards by HODLing eDOGE, you will be able to claim any time you want. The success of Dogecoin and tokens that passively gain yield makes this the perfect combination. You will earn Dogecoin (PEG) on Binance Smart Chain.

Anti-Whale: Max wallet 1% Anti-dump: Max Sell 0.05% of Supply Anti-Bot: Sell once every 30 minutes

Initially there will be a 30% tax on all purchases of EDOGE.

This is to stop early adopters from dumping, requiring them to hold for a longer amount of time to generate passive income in the form of Dogecoin.

Later, this tax will be lowered as the liquidity pool becomes stable enough to transact larger amounts without creating huge dips or price impacts.

Tokenomics: 30% Buy and Transfer 20% Sell (70% for Liquidity, 20% for Staking and 10% to Burn)

After Liquidity is built up Tokenomics will be locked at the following values: Tokenomics: 10% Tax Total (60% Liquidity, 30% Staking, 10% Burn)

BUY: [https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x3eE4c28EC61e3446289De4c9124866FCCf9b9511](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x3eE4c28EC61e3446289De4c9124866FCCf9b9511)

This is not financial advise, as always DYOR and invest only what you can afford to lose.

We strongly believe that Dogecoin will rule the world.With this coin you will gain Dogecoin as reflection.HODL to earn more Dogecoin. Don't think about transferring chains or buying Dogecoin from RobinHood. You can stay right here, on the BSC and earn Dogecoin without ever having to go cross-chain! And, without ever needing to purchase Dogecoin!

MUCH WOW!

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,🏎 MiniCar | 2 Days Old | Microcap | Crypto Messiah Tweet | Hourly $ADA Rewards | Coinhunt Promo Starting Tomorrow!,"Let me introduce you to $MiniCar, an $ADA (Cardano) rewarding token that just launched fairly on the BSC 2 days ago! Now we all know Cardano has been one of the hottest and fastest growing coins in all of crypto in the past few weeks and still has a lot of room for growth, especially with the upcoming launch of smart contracts on September 12 and Charles Hoskinson’s world changing vision. The Devs at $MiniCar don’t intend to change the world, but they do believe they can make a change in the BSC realm and make the token stand out among all the other reward yielding tokens by providing the community with a fun and rewarding journey to the moon, with high $ADA reflections, weekly giveaways and car-themed NFTs in the future.

📈 Poocoin and Coinsniper ads already secured. 2-day Coinhunt promo starting tomorrow. Crypto Messiah just tweeted about them as well!

💸 6% in $ADA rewards automatically airdropped into all holders' wallets every 60 minutes. Weekly giveaways for all wallet holders of at least 0.15% of the supply, first giveaway already took place, while the second is taking place tonight!

⚙️ Tokenomics: 10 billion total supply, 18% transaction tax. From which 6% will be redirected to holders, 2% to the burn address liquidity pool, 5% to the giveaway wallet and the remaining 5% to the marketing wallet

❌ Unique anti-whale 🐳 and anti-snipe 🎯 features in-place

🔒 Initial liquidity provided is locked on dxsale for 1 year, while the liquidity generated from transactions is sent to a permanent burn address (Inaccessible by anyone)

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Moondano - Earn ADA Rewards - Cardano Blockchain migration and DEX in the works," 

Moondano is the next big reward token that will reward you automatically with pegged ADA tokens just by holding. The project was just launched, so this is your chance to be early for the next moonshot. There is a sweepstake whitelist competition to avoid a botted presale.

Whitelist link: [https://sweepwidget.com/view/26868-16ufobtx](https://sweepwidget.com/view/26868-16ufobtx)

We are also holding a small private presale currently which is 15% cheaper than the public presale price to raise funds for marketing and project related expenses.

Moondano will be your next Moonshot and by massively increasing in value and rewarding you with pegged ADA tokens this is an absolute no brainer to get into.

We are planning to airdrop holders of our token actual ADA tokens once ADA smart contracts are introduced.

We plan to launch our own DEX platform and token just like Pancakeswap on BSC.

**⚙️Tokenomics:**

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000

Buy tax:  
5% ADA Reward 🏆  
3% Liquidity 💧  
2% Marketing 📣

Sell tax:  
10% ADA Reward 🏆  
3% Liquidity 💧  
2% Marketing 📣

The fee for buying is very low at just 10% to encourage buying and an upwards momentum.

At the same time the reward fee for selling is increased to punish paperhands. Diamondhands 💎 will be rewarded with with a whopping 10% ! ADA distribution per sell.

""If you can't hold, you won't be rich."" - CZ

There will be a 5% Team wallet and 3% Exchange wallet used for future CEX listings locked in our custom smart contracts (so that rewards will still be paid out). Of course those will be verified on BSCScan.

Furthermore to ensure a smooth launch there will be Anti-Bot, Anti-Whale and Anti-Sniper features implemented by our developers.

In case you have any questions for us, feel free to DM us or ask questions in the chat.

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,ADAflect launching on August 28th on BSC - Hold ADAflect and receive ADA payments directly to your wallet! - Audit by Paladin Security - $50k starting Liquidity and Anti-Bot Scripts,"On August 28th at 20:00 UTC ADAflect is launching on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The premise is simple: you hold ADAflect and receive ADA payments every 60 minutes. That's possible thanks to the cheap fees on the Binance Smart Chain network! They stated that one of the reasons why they went with Binance Smart Chain is so that everyone can buy in and get a chance to receive dividends in ADA.

The team will provide a starting Liquidity of $50.000 and have Anti-Bot protection scripts running, so there is a good chance to make some x's.

It's a long term project with long term support from the team behind it. They have already put up a website which I'll link below. To further provide security, their contract is currently in audit by Paladin Security.

It's a fair launch, so there'll be no team tokens and no pre-sale, everyone gets the same fair chance to participate and earn some nice ADA dividends.

&#x200B;

**Please see below for a summary of the token:**

\-$50k starting Liquidity, Anti-Bot scripts

\-Hold ADAflect, receive ADA directly to your wallet every 60 minutes

\-Liquidity Lock upon launch

""If you can't hold, you won't be rich."" - CZ

There will be a 5% Team wallet and 3% Exchange wallet used for future CEX listings locked in our custom smart contracts (so that rewards will still be paid out). Of course those will be verified on BSCScan.

Furthermore to ensure a smooth launch there will be Anti-Bot, Anti-Whale and Anti-Sniper features implemented by our developers.

In case you have any questions for us, feel free to DM us or ask questions in the chat.

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,🏎 MiniCar | Launched Fairly Less Than 24 Hours Ago | 30K Market Cap | Crypto Messiah Tweet | Hourly $ADA Rewards | First Giveaway Tonight!,"Let me introduce you to $MiniCar, an $ADA (Cardano) rewarding token that just launched fairly on the BSC yesterday! Now we all know Cardano has been one of the hottest and fastest growing coins in all of crypto in the past few weeks and still has a lot of room for growth, especially with the upcoming launch of smart contracts on September 12 and Charles Hoskinson’s world changing vision. The Devs at $MiniCar don’t intend to change the world, but they do believe they can make a change in the BSC realm and make the token stand out among all the other reward yielding tokens by providing the community with a fun and rewarding journey to the moon, with high $ADA reflections, weekly giveaways and car-themed NFTs in the future.

📈 Poocoin and Coinsniper ads already secured. 2-day Coinhunt promo coming up. Influencer tweets ready to go. Crypto Messiah just tweeted about them as well!

💸 6% in $ADA rewards automatically airdropped into all holders' wallets every 60 minutes. Weekly giveaways for all wallet holders of at least 0.15% of the supply, first giveaway is taking place tonight!

⚙️ Tokenomics: 10 billion total supply, 18% transaction tax. From which 6% will be redirected to holders, 2% to the burn address liquidity pool, 5% to the giveaway wallet and the remaining 5% to the marketing wallet

❌ Unique anti-whale 🐳 and anti-snipe 🎯 features in-place

🔒 Initial liquidity provided will be locked on dxsale for 1 year, while the liquidity generated from transactions will be sent to a permanent burn address (Inaccessible by anyone)

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"💎 AdaCash is exploding, early investors did 80X, still going HIGHER! Only 80K Market Cap🚀 [10% ADA Rewards, Poocoin ADS, Applied on CoinGecko & LP Locked]","We have just applied on CoinGecko with Fast Tracking (excepted to get accepted tomorrow), launched Poocoin ADS and much more great things are along the way! This team is really amazing at achieving things, I believe this project can reach at least 1 Million market cap very soon (that’s a +10X from here).

AdaCash aims to be the fastest-growing cryptocurrency of its kind. AdaCash will reward holders in a unique way. Our tokenomics include a monthly increase of the Buying Fee tax regarding the ADA rewards. This means that holders will receive larger and larger awards as time goes by. 


🔴 It’s now live on PancakeSwap - Fair Launched Yesterday 🔴


🌕 ADA reflections will increase 0.5% every month, starting from 10% and going up to 15% in rewards.
Sell fees will stay the same.

-Marketing Plan
We applied on CoinGecko, we just launched poocoin advertisements 24/7 (You can see the proof below), we are in talks with 2 Twitter Influencers with more than 100k followers. Within a few days, our marketing wallet will grow, and we will use those funds for even more aggressive marketing on different platforms, ie facebook. We also plan to use the marketing funds to buy votes on CoinHunters & CoinSniper to get to the top #1 crypto on these platforms. After we reach 1,000 holders, and we get some volume, we will apply to CoinMarketCap.

-Tokenomics

🔴 Total Supply: 10,000,000,000

♨️ Fee: 10% from all transactions goes as a reward to holders, 2% goes to the marketing wallet.

⚡ Redistribution automatic every 24 hours.



✅ Early investors will have the true opportunity to return their investment in a few days, as long as we get a good volume flowing.



✅ Team doxxed + Audit will be completed by Techrate.

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Cardano Price Prediction - ADA Going to $10 or $1 (Full Analysis)," Cardano (ADA) has officially become the largest crypto holding in my portfolio across all platforms. I am a believer in the technology, the team/developers behind it, the fiercely loyal community led by Charles Hoskinson, etc. Look forward to the Cardano Summit news and more catalysts ahead. Giving back the one way I can – creating more content! Let me know if you find it helpful, plan to make more.

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,$ADABoy Huge Partnerships Done | More Partnerships coming | Highest ADA Rewards | Chart on an Uptrend,"I've been whaling on this one hard for weeks, but it's finally coming to true fruition.

ADABoy is finally finding its feet and learning to run.

It's got a partnership with **BabyTron**, which features exclusive deals such as **airdrops** 🪂 and many more.

This means that ADABoy holders currently get **more than just ADA rewards:** they get multiple reward tokens, just by keeping their hands 💎

They're also partnered with **HotPotato**, which will act as a **buy-back ♻ partner** for our favorite ADABoy.

But it doesn't end there. They've got even MORE partnerships incoming.

The **dashboard** is also almost complete, and I'm beyond hyped for it. Coupled with AMAs, this is one token I'm finally bullish on in these market conditions.

It's easy money. Why miss out?

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,💎 MiniADA | 🚨 Fair launch in 1 hour! | 💳 BSC Token that provides anonymous VISA cards to all HOLDERS! | Website live! | Liquidity locked by Mudra for 2 years! | Low marketcap! | Don't miss it | 🌟,"💎 MiniADA - Cryptocurrency token that provides anonymous VISA cards to all HOLDERS!   

  

  

🚨🚨 FAIR LAUNCH IN 1 HOUR! 🚨🚨  

  

☎️ TELEGRAM: [https://t.me/TheMiniADA](https://t.me/TheMiniADA)  

  

💻 WEBSITE: [https://www.mini-ada.com/](https://www.mini-ada.com/)  

  

  

  

For the first time on DeFi, you can choose to take your Cardano reflections (from holding MiniADA) and anonymously spend them in the real world using any currency. No cross-chain conversions. No registration. No personal details. Soon, you can sit back, relax and watch as the MiniADA token contract automatically determines when it’s time to issue your card.  

Dinners, movies, vacations – it’s on us.  

  

Love the proof-of-stake of the famous Cardano crypto? Well this one is for you then!  

These guys have created a Binance Smart Chain version of Cardano, with Autostaking and damn it looks promising!  

  

Here are some specs:  

✅ Verified Contract  

✅ Locked liquidity - Liquidity is locked on Mudra platform for 24 months on fair launch! This means the team cannot pull the liquidity and rug the project.  

✅ Renounced Ownership  

  

Tokenomics:  

🔥 4% To holders  

💧 4% To liquidity  

👤 2% To Development / Marketing wallet  

  

💎 FAIR LAUNCH  

\- 100% of the MiniADA supply was seeded as liquidity. That means no presale and no allocation to team members.  

  

💎 REWARDS FOR HOLDERS  

\- 4% of all transactions are distributed to holders in Cardano BEP20. No need to claim, all distributions happen automatically every hour.  

  

💎 LIQUIDITY POOL FEE   

\- 4% of all transactions are distributed to already locked liquidity pool.   

  

✅ Initial investment in locked liquidity pool on MUDRA platform is 5,5k USD!  

  

Here's our roadmap:  

🌟Phase 1:  

\- Token idea  

\- Create TG group  

\- Create social accounts  

\- Awarness through Reddit/Influencers.  

\- Set a countdown timer and Launch successfully.  

  

🌟Phase 2:  

\- Minor crypto related websites listings with paid upvotes: Coinsniper, Coinhunt, Gemfinder, Coinvote  

\- Marketing push  

\- Videos by TikTokers  

\- Video by Youtuber  

\- Instagram paid stories  

\- Shill Bots  

\- Pinned messages in major Telegram groups  

  

🌟 Phase 3:  

Apply for major listings such as:  

\- Coingecko  

\- Coinmarketcap  

  

💳 GET YOUR MiniADA ANONYMOUS CARD 💳  

  

✅ AUTOMATIC  

When the DAPP is complete, you can automatically convert your Cardano reflections as MiniADA cards with a few clicks. No jumping chains. No registration. Just anonymous spending at your choice of 37 million retailers online and ATM usage.  

  

✅ UNIVERSAL  

Right out of the gate, MiniADA cards work online, anywhere Mastercard® and Visa® are accepted. When we roll out our physical cards and Apple Pay integration, you’ll be able to spend in person, almost anywhere.  

  

✅ INTEGRATED. UNCOMPLICATED.  

Soon, everyone will be able to unlock the guiltless freedom of everyday spending using their cryptocurrency reflections without interference, questioning, or resistance. Life will be as it should: Financially empowered for all.

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Moondano 🌑 ($MD) | Launching in 5 days | Auto-Claim ADA | Small Private Sale live | Early 100x opportunity BSC Token," 

Moondano is the next big reward token that will reward you automatically with pegged ADA tokens just by holding. The project was just launched, so this is your chance to be early for the next moonshot. There is a sweepstake whitelist competition to avoid a botted presale.

Whitelist link: [https://sweepwidget.com/view/26868-16ufobtx](https://sweepwidget.com/view/26868-16ufobtx)

We are also holding a small private presale currently which is 15% cheaper than the public presale price to raise funds for marketing and project related expenses.

Moondano will be your next Moonshot and by massively increasing in value and rewarding you with pegged ADA tokens this is an absolute no brainer to get into.

We are planning to airdrop holders of our token actual ADA tokens once ADA smart contracts are introduced.

We plan to launch our own DEX platform and token just like Pancakeswap on BSC.

**⚙️Tokenomics:**

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000

Buy tax:  
5% ADA Reward 🏆  
3% Liquidity 💧  
2% Marketing 📣

Sell tax:  
10% ADA Reward 🏆  
3% Liquidity 💧  
2% Marketing 📣

The fee for buying is very low at just 10% to encourage buying and an upwards momentum.

At the same time the reward fee for selling is increased to punish paperhands. Diamondhands 💎 will be rewarded with with a whopping 10% ! ADA distribution per sell.

""If you can't hold, you won't be rich."" - CZ

There will be a 5% Team wallet and 3% Exchange wallet used for future CEX listings locked in our custom smart contracts (so that rewards will still be paid out). Of course those will be verified on BSCScan.

Furthermore to ensure a smooth launch there will be Anti-Bot, Anti-Whale and Anti-Sniper features implemented by our developers.

ADA,CryptoCurrencyTrading,🏎 MiniCar | Launched Fairly A Few Minutes Ago | Hourly $ADA Rewards | Daily And Weekly Giveaways!,"Let me introduce you to $MiniCar, an $ADA (Cardano) rewarding token that just launched fairly on the BSC a few minutes ago! Now we all know Cardano has been one of the hottest and fastest growing coins in all of crypto in the past few weeks and still has a lot of room for growth, especially with the upcoming launch of smart contracts on September 12 and Charles Hoskinson’s world changing vision. The Devs at $MiniCar don’t intend to change the world, but they do believe they can make a change in the BSC realm and make the token stand out among all the other reward yielding tokens by providing the community with a fun and rewarding journey to the moon, with high $ADA reflections, weekly giveaways and car-themed NFTs in the future.

📈 Poocoin and Coinsniper ads already secured. 2-day Coinhunt promo coming up. Influencer tweets ready to go.

💸 6% in $ADA rewards automatically airdropped into all holders' wallets every 60 minutes

⚙️ Tokenomics: 10 billion total supply, 18% transaction tax. From which 6% will be redirected to holders, 2% to the burn address liquidity pool, 5% to the giveaway wallet and the remaining 5% to the marketing wallet

❌ Unique anti-whale 🐳 and anti-snipe 🎯 features in-place

🔒 Initial liquidity provided will be locked on dxsale for 1 year, while the liquidity generated from transactions will be sent to a permanent burn address (Inaccessible by anyone)

ADA,Binance,What network should I use when transferring Cardano ADA from Binance.US to a Trust wallet?,"[Binance.US](https://Binance.US) offers: Cardano and BEP2

And in the Trust wallet, there are 4 Cardano chains:

1. Cardano TRC10 CDO
2. CardanoBEP2 ADA
3. Binance-Peg Cardano ADA
4. Cream Cardano Token crADA

I'm new to this and still trying to figure it out. It appears the Trust wallet doesn't have the native Cardano network and I'm still unclear on BEP2 / BEP20, when to use them, pros, cons, etc. 

The first transaction I did, I sent a small amount of LINK to my wallet using BNB - the transaction fee was far better than ERC20 and the transaction happened almost instantly but my LINK became BNB in the process. Now, do I leave it BNB? I'd like to swap it back to LINK but that doesn't appear to be an option in the wallet. 

Let's say I was willing to pay the exorbitant ERC20 gas fees, if I sent it to CardanoBEP2 would that change the token?

I really like some of these altcoin companies and the tech they're working on so I expect to have a diverse portfolio and would like one wallet to keep all my coins if possible.

Is it normal to have multiple wallets for different purposes or is there a good choice that does it all? For reference, I wanna do a mix of trading and hodling and would prefer a hot wallet for now but am not opposed to a cold wallet.",18,2021-02-05 04:08:52,69

At the time of writing, ADA trades at $1,14 with a 2.7% and 4.8% loss in the daily and weekly charts, respectively. 

The cryptocurrency has managed to make its way into the crypto top 5 by market capitalization after Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP lost their positions. The latter has been severely hit by the bearish trend and stands at $0,18, while XRP stands at $0,58.

At its current levels, Cardano (ADA) recorded a recent Relative Strength Index (RSI), a metric used to the price momentum of a cryptocurrency, low of 27, according to trader Eric Thies. He believes ADA was at a similar low on this metric during March 2020, before the event called “Black Thursday”.

In current market conditions, most coins tend to correlate with Bitcoin and its performance. Therefore, BTC’s price must continue with its recovery in order for ADA, ETH, and other cryptocurrencies to recover.

Pseudonym trader Crypto Punisher has compared the ADA/ETH trading pair and found a positive outlook for the former. Ethereum has been one of the top performer cryptocurrencies in recent months, but the trader believes Cardano (ADA) could take that place: 
            "" …at macro level support as ETH continues to show strength. given that ADA has held strong all throughout this downtrend I think a bounce to outperform ETH short-term is enticing enough R:R wise. """,2,2021-07-24 06:53:32,8

I have read on ledger support articles that :

that Cardano(ADA) sent to Binance-Peg Cardano Token is not the same as actual coin, and i'm unable to transfer it back to anywhere since it has no value and for the transfer it's asking for fees.

Does this means it's lost?

ADA,Binance,Cardano NFT SpaceBud Deposit on Binance // Please Assist," Hi there,

So I purchased a Cardano-based NFT known as a SpaceBud on the 26th of March. The SpaceBud was sent to my Yoroi Wallet. You can see under ""Assets"" that SpaceBud no. 9681 was sent to my wallet.  


https://preview.redd.it/2xb84ht9zgq71.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=c411842e888b251794eda7c43b3f0e34f675bb8d

Then on April 12th I sent some ADA (Cardano's Token) to my Binance address. However, I was not aware that I had selected to send ""All"" which sent my NFT as well. You can see that ""-1 Assets"" was sent being the SpaceBud9681.  
I have since checked on the SpaceBudz website and seen that my SpaceBud belongs to a new address:  
https://spacebudz.io/profile?address=Ae2tdPwUPEZJG1Lgysu1Ca4e67wyypmqiVyRtxtoHcMVF82AJtxcFTtzzrX

You can see by following the above link that my NFT together with 30 others is sitting on that address in addition to around 21 million ADA.  
I think, if possible, could you check if this is a Cardano address owned by Binance. Any other information would really help me.

ADA,Binance,CARDANO (ADA) SET TO HIT $1.50 ON CLASSIC TRIANGLE BREAKOUT PATTERN,"KEY CARDANO TAKEAWAYS

Cardano’s ADA, now the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, maintains its top rankings as it sustains its uptrend three days in a row.

The ADA/USD exchange rate’s uptrend comes as a breakout-move of its previous Descending Triangle range.

That raises the pair’s potential to hit $1.50 in the coming sessions.

Ethereum’s top rival Cardano is on a tear.

The blockchain platform’s native asset, ADA, surged by up to 52 percent after bottoming out near $0.95 at the beginning of this week. As of Wednesday, the token has formed an intraday high of $1.45 before correcting mildly lower to the $1.35-1.44 range during the Asia-Pacific session Thursday

Traders flocked into the Cardano market after Bitcoin started correcting lower upon establishing its record high above $61,000.

ADA offered an ideal refuge against the top cryptocurrency after its listing on Coinbase Pro, a US-based digital assets trading platform. More bullish tailwinds for ADA came from the ongoing craze surrounding non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Cardano allows users to create the said assets on its blockchain following its latest “Mary” upgrade.

$1.50
Technical indicators added to the bullish confluence. The ADA/USD exchange rate’s latest move upside had it broke out of a Descending Triangle. Traders see the said structure as a bullish continuation pattern, primarily if the downside consolidation occurs after a strong move upward. ADA was trading higher before forming the Triangle.

Typically, a breakout move emerging out of a falling triangle structure leads the asset higher by as much as the maximum distance between the structure’s upper and lower trendline. In ADA’s case, the length spans about $0.47. If one adds $0.47 to the level from where the token has broken the Triangle, then the breakout target comes near $1.50.

“It is essential to note that the bullish outlook has been validated by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD),” said analysts at CoinGape, a crypto-focused YouTube channel. “The trend momentum indicator has crossed into the positive region, suggesting that the least resistance path is upward.”

Besides, the MACD line leads the way above the signal line, which is another bullish signal,” they added.

RISKS

On the flip side, the ADA/USD’s Relative Strength Indicator on the four-hour chart has entered the overbought territory. That increases the pair’s likelihood of correcting lower to neutralize short-term buying sentiments. Should a correction appear, Cardano risks correcting to its flipped resistance area of $1.26-1.29.


Meanwhile, fundamental risks also threaten to reverse ADA’s bullish course. The Cardano token has rallied majorly because of its rival Ethereum’s limitation as a blockchain project. The latter suffers from higher gas and transaction fees issues but remains committed to solve it by the end of this year through a long-awaited protocol upgrade from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.

One industry observer commented that he still has to see a single popular application operating atop the Cardano blockchain, unlike Ethereum, which boasts about projects like Tether and UniSwap. That makes ADA’s latest gains more speculative, prone to wavering.",8,2021-03-18 12:25:33,8
ADA,Binance,Cardano ecosystem DeFi project comparison,"Hello, I did some research on DeFi projects and did some comparison.

Comparison between MELD, Ray Network, AADA Finance and Maladex.

First of all, Total token supply MELD and Ray Network has huge amount of tokens which means Initial price will probably crash after listing as there will be a lot of dumpers. AADA Finance and Maladex has relatively small supply in comparison to others. What small token supply means? First of all it mean's tokens will be worth not pennies but $$$, secondly there after listing the price will sustain stable or will be growing. ISPO supply MELD has 1b of tokens for ISPO which will be distributed on December 8 as an airdrop and they will be listing on DEX'es till the new year so the price will definitely go down on the listing date as there will be a lot of people who will want to get rid of the ISPO rewards for cash.

Ray Network has a Huge ISPO supply which will result in price a crash when people will receive the rewards.

AADA Finance has 100m of total token supply and they're ISPO supply is 12.5m which means ur getting pretty big slice of the cake with ISPO when the total supply 100m. They announced partnership with CHAINLINK but not yet date of listing,

Maladex has low total token supply but they're ISPO supply is low too, so you will be receiving valuable rewards too.

For conclusion, MELD and Ray Network to double in price after listing will need hundred millions of $$$ to be poured in when AADA Finance and Maladex with low supply is likely to go 2x, 5x in price easily.

ADA,Binance,📣Be in charge of your ADA and stake it in Cardano on-chain wallet!⚠️,"**1. Exchanges are a HUGE target for hackers**

Not your keys, not your crypto.

**2. Lockup Periods**

Binance locks up your Ada for set periods of time when you stake with them. Daedalus and Yoroi have ZERO lockup. You always have access to your funds.

**3. Decentralization**

Yes, you can do slightly better with Yoroi or Daedalus in the right pool, but the better argument for delegating to a smaller pool shouldn't be about ROA, it should be that Cardano needs the small pools to exist. It’s very hard for the smaller pools to compete with Binance. Binance is destroying the single pool operators, and we need the single pool operators to exist for Cardano’s decentralization to be real.

**4. Availability**

Binance isn’t always available. Sometimes we need to send Ada somewhere, and you can always do that if the Ada is in your wallet. With Binance, not so much.

**5. Now what?**

Pick a stake pool to stake. Yes, the stake pool choices are overwhelming. Use a tool like [pooltool.io](https://pooltool.io/), or [adapools.org](https://adapools.org/) to help you choose a good one.

I also recommend that you go with a pool operator that you can connect with over social media. There are many good ones around. It's important that you build a relationship with your pool operator!!

&#x200B;

That being said, I'd like you to check our pool [STICK](https://adapools.org/pool/bb3ef210ec1e397f57d796b2025fd4b85500b49a56a37f8d12db16eb) . We have a great mission. We are launching High Altitude Balloons to the stratosphere, we are actively donating $ to reforestation project and more.

What a joke. Cardano network fees are at around 0.17 ada regardless of amount you move around.

Raising these fees from 1 to 5 ada now is THEIR choice. Not because Cardano network requires it. This is very unfortunate way of marketing their own BNB or BSC tokens.

If you are in the Binance deposit/withdrawal page and you click on Cardano (ADA) deposit, it says ""Notice: Coins will be deposited immediately after 15 network confirmation""  Clearly that is inaccurate.

ADA,Binance,Binance Transfer Question (Cardano ADA to BC Vault),"This is a bit of an odd one but I'm hoping that someone can lend a hand here.......

I have a [Binance.us](https://Binance.us) account - no issues there and I'm able to deposit funds and also purchase several types of crypto. 

I have a BC Vault that I recently purchased. Setup was pretty easy and no issues there.

In Binance I copy/pasted the addresses provided by the vault and whitelisted them.

**The Good News:**

I've been able to transfer a small amount of Ethereum into the vault with no issues and can see it in the Vault. The value of ETH changes by a bit every few minutes so I know the vault+software is 'talking' to the appropriate services and updating.

**The Bad News:**

However, when I was attempting to do a small test transfer of some Cardano ADA into the BC Vault the funds have never appeared. This has failed twice now with just a couple of ADA per transfer (*I attempted with both the 'Byron' & 'Shelley' version address provided by my vault*). 

I've checked the transaction number on the Cardano blockchain explorer and both transactions have >500 verifications after 12 hours and both addresses match the 'send to' address provided by the vault.

Am I missing something here? Do I need to generate a new ADA wallet in the Vault for another test? Anything else I can test or check? Something odd with the whitelisting function? Don't want to just keep sending ADA out into the vast darkness. 

Thanks in advance for any help that the community can provide!",1,2020-12-18 05:00:44,0

ADA,Binance,Kazakhstan joins hands with Binance to develop a robust digital asset market in the country. Are there any chances Kazakhstan will become the second region after El Salvador to give the green light to De-Fi to enter its economy?,"Chances are there since De-Fi has enough potential to fill the shoes of the traditional financial system.   According to Coin Telegraph. A legal note is signed between Binance's CEO and the President of Kazakhstan. The plans are regarding developing regulations and policies for crypto assets in the country.     
De-Fi space is booming across the world; Kazakhstan might don't want to stay behind in this race.   Kazakhstan is among the major hubs of Cryptocurrency and the De-Fi community. Even a big chunk of Binance's community is from the country.      
When coming to its adaption to the economy, Kazakhstan might not take such a big step after looking at El Salvador's economic conditions, which are pretty terrible.       
However, as De-Fi development is rapid, Kazakhstan and other countries might regulate cryptocurrencies in various sectors.     
Banking, telecom, advertising, and fintech are some areas where cryptocurrencies can grow drastically at any time. Utility based projects like Solana that has lot of utility based dapps built on that, BAT that comes in play with brave browser reward system, TokLok which allow holders to enjoy the platform's paid messaging app services for free alongside winning locking rewards and Cardano well-known for its Ouroboros protocol can be top players.

I had opted for ""Up and Exercised"" 

This is the equation of how the return is calculated on binance's FAQ

(Subscription Amount * Strike Price) * [1+(APY% * deposits days /365)]

Using this calculation, I'm getting the return of roughly 870$

Did I miss something or should I avoid using the earn options in Binance?

There is also a report going around that the SEC is also probing the US division of Binance to ensure that it is appropriately differentiated from the global Binance body.

Although some individuals could tag this whole enquiry and probe as a mere witch hunt due to the fact that compared to networks like Cardano,  zetrix, tron, and even Solana,  BNBchain holds the binance Exchange which is accredited as the largest crypto exchange in the world.

Whichever direction it swings though, I'm certain these are pretty huge inquiries, and its outcome either Positive or Negative would affect the price value of BNB Token which is currently down by 4% since this news went public.",22,2022-06-07 19:24:29,33

ADA,Binance,⚠️Binance raised withdrawal fees from 1 to 5 ada while marketing their own token as 'cheap'.," [**⚠️Binance raised withdrawal fees from 1 to 5 ada while marketing their own token as 'cheap'.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lgpjo4/binance_raised_withdrawal_fees_from_1_to_5_ada/)[**Exchange**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/?f=flair_name%3A%22Exchange%22)📷📷📷📷

What a joke. Cardano network fees are at around 0.17 ada regardless of amount you move around.

Raising these fees from 1 to 5 ada now is THEIR choice. Not because Cardano network requires it. This is very unfortunate way of marketing their own BNB or BSC tokens.

ADA,Binance,What network should I use when transferring Cardano ADA from Binance.US to a Trust wallet?,"[Binance.US](https://Binance.US) offers: Cardano and BEP2

And in the Trust wallet, there are 4 Cardano chains:

1. Cardano TRC10 CDO
2. CardanoBEP2 ADA
3. Binance-Peg Cardano ADA
4. Cream Cardano Token crADA

I'm new to this and still trying to figure it out. It appears the Trust wallet doesn't have the native Cardano network and I'm still unclear on BEP2 / BEP20, when to use them, pros, cons, etc. 

The first transaction I did, I sent a small amount of LINK to my wallet using BNB - the transaction fee was far better than ERC20 and the transaction happened almost instantly but my LINK became BNB in the process. Now, do I leave it BNB? I'd like to swap it back to LINK but that doesn't appear to be an option in the wallet. 

Let's say I was willing to pay the exorbitant ERC20 gas fees, if I sent it to CardanoBEP2 would that change the token?

I really like some of these altcoin companies and the tech they're working on so I expect to have a diverse portfolio and would like one wallet to keep all my coins if possible.

Is it normal to have multiple wallets for different purposes or is there a good choice that does it all? For reference, I wanna do a mix of trading and hodling and would prefer a hot wallet for now but am not opposed to a cold wallet.",18,2021-02-05 04:08:52,69

ADA,Binance,All my money stolen from TW,"Binance Support: Case ID #73424267

****** FINAL EDIT & MY PLAN MOVING FORWARD IN ATTEMPTS TO SHAKE UP THESE HACKERS AND SCAMMERS ON THE BSC AND ETH NETWORK AS CLEARLY BINANCE AND TRUSTWALLET ARE NOT WILLING TO: Got a response from Binance and it was as expected and similar to TrustWallet, simply don't care, to summarise. They have basically said, it is not a Binance address, even though they are a CEX, the address is on BSC and the funds cannot be frozen (This recent thread may contradict this statement unfortunately: https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/nvlkk6/stolen_funds_sitting_in_binance_wallets_and_no/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).

They didn't even bother to trace the hacker/scammer and the transactions nor provide any insight on what may have happened from the issues I have raised in terms of security of their entity TrustWallet.

Didn't even mention they will keep track of the address(es) and if the BNB/funds end up in Binance itself, they will take further action. They did state, the initial address I provided has been blacklisted even though by the time they responded, the funds were transferred elsewhere. To me, they are complicit to these hacks/scams in many indirect ways and for the way they treat these matters of their customers that use their platforms.

Their response was 30 to 36 hours late if not more, the words stolen, scammed, hacked, should have triggered their support algorithm and respond faster than the timeframe they did due to the sensitive nature of the subject at hand.

The initial support estimated response time the ticket was created stood at 6 hours or less.

I am going to move all my vast amounts of mainstream coins from Binance such as BTC, ETH (staked but will take the BETH), ADA, XRP, XMR, Polkadot, VET etc. etc. And move it to another of my Trezors ordered and on the way, will not hurt them one bit but for me, will feel safer (They did refund everyone the last time they got hacked but don't want the hassle after what's happened with TW, and yes I did know when I first signed up. Most of the assets are in cold storage, same as Coinbase etc).

Am not a Trustwallet customer, never again and will try to avoid the temptation of using Binance and/or its several umbrella entities no matter a leader or not in the space. ETH 2.0 coming up and fees will be dealt with, not sure what will happen to Binance then and whether they will fork it further.

*iOS also announced that the TrustWallet dApp browser will no longer be supported on their devices as it does not meet their guidelines, what a surprise!* Good for them as I have come to the conclusion after all the OPSEC I carried out to protect myself as per their suggested guidelines and my own, was not and will never be enough. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN NO MATTER WHAT!

Metamask has never given me such issues, to point out and neither all the other wallets I have had this far, only TW. Not saying they are more secure or otherwise, just haven't experienced the scenario I have with TW.

I felt better today, since morning, thanks to all of you kind people on Reddit, specifically those that have helped to upvote this for visibility (Even though at the top and Binance clearly saw it but decided to respond many hours later though chat) and the kind comments. Including an acquaintance who is an Ethereum security risk analyst who after I spoke to dawned a few ideas in my mind.

I have decided that as these providers won't do nothing, such as Binance and TrustWallet and help people like myself and others then we as a community should do something ourselves.

*This really devastated me via emotions, left me literally numb at some point where the mind acted in self-defense mode and felt nothing in the end. Am fed up with the way these major platforms act and treat and not protect the same people that make them billions year after year! All welcoming when you bring your money in and will take it instantly but want nothing to do with you when you are in the dark and need help and desperate for assistance!

Well, now I have a plan which is at its infancy as of today but intricate nonetheless. Will use my remaining disposable income and knowledge to produce a sophisticated platform to protect myself and others from these scams/hackers as much as possible on the BSC and ETH network and do the job that Binance and TrustWallet should be doing themselves to protect us before and after we end up in this position.

If you would like to be part or contribute via knowledge or expertise somehow at your free time, let me know, open to all information, am funding it all. Further details to come.*
******

Edit 20:57 GMT (thread tidy up): Some comments are very difficult to read, would have really liked to reply to everyone, but can't deal with seeing certain assumptions made and things being said right now, too hurtful after what has happened to me, I feel numb, don't wish this on anyone. Am mentally drained today and not in the right thought process, I apologise if I haven't replied to all of you. 

Thanks for the support all, also for the comforting words from most of you, and upvotes for visibility, *Binance still haven't got back to me and whether the wallet in question has been frozen for investigation.*

Will update soon, just need to unwind somehow right now. No, am not karma farming, you will never see this account comment elsewhere again to prove so. Really sorry for the long thread, some very important information though, especially if you are new. Please try to read it for knowledge please.


--- Original thread ---

Don't know how much roughly, but possibly £150,000 taken from my TrustWallet which had max wallets totaling 15 wallets. This seems to started happening 4 hours ago whilst I was asleep. (As I had so many wallets in one TrustWallet and some tokens have no pricing updated, the money possibly less) Just one one of my TrustWallet wallets tokens had reached nearly £500,000 previously and had a lot of potential as you can see).

One wallet fine but all wallets (Seedphrases needed for every wallet setup in Trustwallet)? How?? I need answers please!

I had the max number of wallets, 15 wallets on my Trustwallet! How can someone obtain all 15 wallet seedphrases? Makes no sense to me whatsoever!

I had a pin, fingerprint lock, signed transactions activated! How can someone take my money? Never shared my seedphrases! Trustwallet email response was not appropriate. All my funds transferred to a BSC address, my assets sold for BNB! Please help me, please!

Already sent messages to Binance to freeze the wallet that sold my assets for BNB, and also transferred all the BNB from my wallets from the main TrustWallet. They transferred all the BNB to their wallet.

Very confused when I had max security on the Trustwallet, just so confused.

I really need urgent help!

Please!

--- Original thread end ---

Edit (Wallets information): ***As people are saying this is fake, which am a little hurt by but I understand, this is Crypto, and everything needs to be transparent and public. My wallets are included at the bottom and also the address that took my money and assets from me. If this Solidifies the case then so be it. All this information has already been given to Binance, still waiting for a response. Wanted to release the info after the response from Binance but will do so now, please spread it as much as you can, would really appreciate it.

EDIT 1: Please, please upvote for visibility so Binance can respond. 

TrustWallet is owned by Binance and was acquired a while ago. 

They should be able to freeze the wallet/wallets of person that stole my money and an investigation to take place. If it happened to me then it may happen to you, God forbid. With max security setup, one wallet I understand ok but all maxed wallets on Trustwallet? 

Makes no sense to me, and need answers... Please upvote, thank you! I will provide anything to prove I own the TrustWallet in question.

Edit 2: As per a comment from another redditor, this should concern all of us, security is very important. 

I had maxed security setup for this TrustWallet. Biometrics/PIN to view seedphrase/nowhere else stored to be accessed, and biometrics/PIN for any transactions made. 

I am left bewildered on how the aforementioned can be breached. Had max wallets on the Trustwallet, so one wallet to be wiped, fair enough but all wallets?? 

I have many other wallets and this is the only one that got wiped, even cold wallets, 3 Trezors, not ledgers as we all know of the data leak. I am clued on security, not a novice. Thanks for the upvotes thus far!

Edit 3: TrustWallet needs a whitelist addresses/devices options within the app too for any transactions that take place, just like Binance which I have activated when I opened the account with them and just like some other well known wallets I have, this can avoid so many issues such as these.

Also 2 factor authentication such as Google authentication is lacking.

No such options within the TrustWallet app currently.

If this gets enough visibility, we can push for the above security measures to be implemented. Trustwallet should not be an exception to these security measures!

Edit 4: Never used PC for this wallet, only a phone especially for TrustWallet due to the amount in question. Biometrics setup on the phone etc.

Any URLs, such as PanCakeSwap I access to make purchases or sales, always log out from after and clear cache through preferences and history. This is standard procedures.

Edit 5: As per a comment, whether there was a random airdrop that I interacted with. No!

That is a form of a possible ""Dusting"" attack, please do not interact with Airdrops that randomly appear in your wallets, usually worth peanuts or nothing at all, I know it's tempting! Please just disable or never activate them! Do not not interact in any way with those tokens.

I am aware of this, like I said, not a novice.

Edit 6: No I have not interacted with a phishing website! I have had so many messages and forms to fill in to share my seed phrase since I have posted this and links to visit which obviously haven't. Block is the only option when someone randomly messages you! Even Binance support users have been setup to scam me.

ETH network has various reference codes where it even provides an insight to contracts that contain malicious code (BSC is a fork of ETH). This information is publicly available to be used in order to check said contracts for malicious code to avoid being scammed. 

This also includes due diligence from our part and knowledge of solidity code sometimes, even checking the contract and seeing what the owner can and cannot do.

Due diligence/research such as, the team, the background, is there DeFi KYC (Private doxxing), what are they attempting to solve and bring new in the space, what is their roadmap, do they have a finished product to be viewed, checked and tested by the community, what are the flaws, do they have backing from a solidified third-party, is it a charity project meaning ""this what want we to do, pay for it and we will get it done"". 

The CEO and owner reputation, their way of speaking and language used, immature? Stay away! Legit non copied Whitepaper with essential information. This is what I can think of right now and that is just the tip of the iceberg as there is so much more.

Is it audited by an official source? Remember that the large percentage of people just want to know that the audit was done but never usually check it. *Audits are an ongoing process, not a once off, as bugs and issues need to be fixed and it keeps being audited until it is completely free of issues*, please remember this.

There are also sites such as rugscreener, tokensniffer, bsccbeck (if it decides to work) etc. to make standard checks at a glance for those not knowledgeable in solidity code for various scams such as honeypots, wallets unlocked, LP locked or not, rugs etc. USE THEM BEFORE INVESTING! Like I said, am aware of security, when you are parting with your money, all checks have to be made.

Am not one to be scammed so easily and this has left me literally so confused, and want to know how this happened as cannot figure it out but guess what? Binance can and want details so they fix this issue and strengthen their security for all of us!

Edit 7: Any access required to a wallet such as from PanCakeSwap and DAPPs only should require read only access and transactions to be authorised prior to being fully connected.  No other exclusive permissions were granted and neither should be requested by any dApp.

I have provided Binance all the details needed already. I will update this once I hear back from them for the community and for the sake of transparency and what their reply was.

Trustwallets reply was essentially ""Sorry for your loss, please take these security measures in future"", but the measures in question were already taken, maximum there is but it is lacking as mentioned in ""Edit 3"" which have to implemented.

Am not using any other TrustWallet right now, personally, moved most of my assets elsewhere from my other TrustWallets, can't risk it. 

Please be very careful with your assets! If they can bypass this then surely there is a serious security flaw for someone to obtain 15 wallet seed phrases from one TrustWallet in some way.

Edit 8: Some information from comments on this thread that popped up to me, which may be further useful to you guys.

Don't ever purchase anything or ever go to transfer tokens randomly from a site given or found anywhere. Check the contract address and obtain it from official sources and creators of the contract if you are to invest, see an opportunity and have done all your checks, even then it is a risk.

Always know the ticker of the token you're trading and always obtain the ""CONTRACT"" from the original official source.

Never trust random Telegrams groups/posts, or CMS posts (r/CryptoMoonShots), r/MarsShots etc. in fact I would say 99.9% are scams from the 200 to 300 tokens released a day!

Near instantly, all tokens are copied and cloned once they are launched, especially all the popular ones, to dupe people. Telegram groups are easily replicated, logos and names changed without any barriers. 

Always double check the usernames and compare them to the official social channels and URLs in browsers if you navigate to projects sites and ensure a valid SSL certificate is installed (green padlock) etc.

You will surprised, how many social channels are replicated too and slight change of one character is added to the usernames  to scam People.

And no, unfortunately Doxxing means nothing for some projects!

Go look up ""SliceOfThePie"", for a recent ""Doxxed"" project that scammed people. Be very, very, careful!

I have fallen for rugpulls myself in the past, never can be too safe in terms of investing and no matter how much research you do, you can be a victim but precautions can be taken, some as shared above.

Edit 9: No matter what I provide, it seems people will always ask for more and am sure whatever I say or details I provide, more answers will be asked for which is fine.

I don't want anyone else to end up in the same boat, so here are some other responses people are seeking. Will try to update and answer any other questions.

It is an Android phone, not an old brick, I wouldn't buy a £300 phone for assets large as these or small for any of my wallets or not take appropriate procedures to secure my assets such as not using third party browsers, only for trading, usually PCS/inbuilt but check my OPSEC for that in my other edits. 

All my phone's for crypto wallets which have substantial amounts have their own phones. No other apps apart from the wallets themselves. 

Not rooted, nor do I have jailbroken iPhones or modded APK'S. I do not use public networks, the packets sent over those, can be infiltrated and information stolen/seen by hackers. 

My networks are private and the setup is such that no public network is allowed to access the phones network and interact with it, airplane mode has to be switched on when not in use regardless, for extra OPSEC measures which I have forgotten about some times overnight if an using that particular phone but that is not a big issue as failing on other important parts is more detrimental.

The phone has never been connected to any laptop or PC ever, no need. Please, if you read my thread and comments, am not a noob when it comes to OPSEC. All I want is visibility and answer from Binance and to recover my funds. Thank you!

Recently, I transferred my ADA coins to my Binance Direct Wallet without researching too much (I know, my bad!). Now, I would like to transfer it back to the Binance platform for trading, however it asks to pay the fees as BNB (it's around 0.000383 BNB).

**Common problems & solutions**

**1. Crypto withdrawal suspended**

● You receive a message saying ‘withdrawal suspended due to risk control’ and have been trying to unlock your account.

● Don’t worry, your funds are SAFU. Our agents will try their best to help unlock the withdrawal - please coordinate with our team and provide relevant information when prompted to do so.

● Withdrawal Risk can be triggered by a number of reasons. Risk control is extremely important. Please note that we can only help you if we deem your case to be legitimate, if you have attempted to hack an account and request for unsuspension, you will be unsuccessful as we have processes in place to prevent this.

Our team works extremely hard to resolve these issues as soon as possible and some cases can take time to resolve but please keep in mind the reason for this is to ensure you, our users, are safe.

**Cases replied by our mods are already in the escalation process. A longer wait after escalation = our team is working hard at investigating the issue.** If there are any updates to the case, our agents will reply to you directly in the chat.

Please refrain from leaving multiple messages in this thread if your case has already been escalated.

**2. Security issues**

● Report hacked accounts and funds.

● Difficulty to reset 2FA and gain access to your account.

**3. Fiat deposit & withdrawal**

● Fiat (not crypto) is taking longer than expected to arrive in your bank / Binance account.

● Involves intermediaries such as bank transfers or buying crypto with credit/debit cards.

● *Note: It can take up to several working days for the money to be credited to your accounts.* [You can find more FAQ here](https://twitter.com/BinanceHelpDesk/status/1391776637071478787)

**4. US persons accessing old Binance.com accounts for offboarding & withdrawal of funds**

● Your funds are SAFU. If you experience issues with withdrawing remaining funds, follow the above steps to get to our live chat queue - our agents will try our best to assist you with the offboarding.

**5. Trading system and other account issues**

● Spot, margin & futures trading

● P2P disputes

● Binance Visa Card transactions

● Unable to complete KYC

● Any other issues

**Please follow the format stated above, your case cannot be escalated if you do not follow this process and your comment may be removed. Following the format helps us classify and identify the issues, escalate them to our relevant departments and get everyone’s problems resolved.** ***Spamming the feed is unfair to other users and will result in a ban.***",4,2024-11-11 05:01:13,215

ADA,Binance,A friend got scammed today of 100k Tron and 1K ADA from Binance,"A friend of mine was having trouble logging into Binance today via 2FA/SMS and tried to contact Binance support.  Frustrated, he searched Google and found 1-800 number.  He called the number and a super helpful scam artist had him install a remote access application on his computer and proceeded to (with my friends help) log into Binance.  He then converted 100k coins of Tron over to BTC and then transferred it off BInance.

This particular friend spent the last several months transferring $20 at a time to build up to what he had, and let it go in a few minutes.  

He called me later in the day to tell me that someone helped him get verified and that he shouldn't have any more access problems, but that the person said he had to wait 24 hours before logging back in.  I realized something was wrong and had him log in, only to find that everything was gone.

I told him that since the guy basically used his computer to do all of this, there is probably nothing that could be done about it.

Please save me all the comments about how stupid could my friend possibly be.  And no, this is not a joke about my friend, he really exists and this really happened to him.

He has access to his account and can provide any information needed.

I think his coins are gone, what do you think?

UPDATE:  

This had nothing to do with Binance other than that is where he had his coins.  I did not mean to indicate that this was a failure on Binance.  This was pure social engineering that took advantage of someone recovering from some major health issues.  

I keep my coins on Binance.

ADA,Binance,"ADA Near Oversold Levels, Why Cardano Could Retake Previous Highs.","Cardano (ADA) has been one of the most resilient coins in the crypto market. While Bitcoin has experienced a 50% correction and has revisited the yearly open, ADA has traded well above its previous lows.

At the time of writing, ADA trades at $1,14 with a 2.7% and 4.8% loss in the daily and weekly charts, respectively. 

The cryptocurrency has managed to make its way into the crypto top 5 by market capitalization after Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP lost their positions. The latter has been severely hit by the bearish trend and stands at $0,18, while XRP stands at $0,58.

At its current levels, Cardano (ADA) recorded a recent Relative Strength Index (RSI), a metric used to the price momentum of a cryptocurrency, low of 27, according to trader Eric Thies. He believes ADA was at a similar low on this metric during March 2020, before the event called “Black Thursday”.

In current market conditions, most coins tend to correlate with Bitcoin and its performance. Therefore, BTC’s price must continue with its recovery in order for ADA, ETH, and other cryptocurrencies to recover.

Pseudonym trader Crypto Punisher has compared the ADA/ETH trading pair and found a positive outlook for the former. Ethereum has been one of the top performer cryptocurrencies in recent months, but the trader believes Cardano (ADA) could take that place: 
            "" …at macro level support as ETH continues to show strength. given that ADA has held strong all throughout this downtrend I think a bounce to outperform ETH short-term is enticing enough R:R wise. """,1,2021-07-24 06:53:32,8

I have read on ledger support articles that :

that Cardano(ADA) sent to Binance-Peg Cardano Token is not the same as actual coin, and i'm unable to transfer it back to anywhere since it has no value and for the transfer it's asking for fees.

1. **You own your private keys**

When you leave your crypto on an exchange, you don't really 'own' it. What does that mean? It means you don't have the private keys to your wallet and if something happens to the exchange then you don’t have any control over your coins because they aren’t in your custody, they belong to the exchange. There are countless stories of exchanges being 'down for maintenance' during periods of high volatility or when other holders need access to them.

2. **No locking period**

Withdraw your ADA anytime you like!

3. **Secure**

Guess what happens when an exchange loses your crypto? Think its 'insured' similarly to when a bank makes an error with your USD? It's not, and you lose. The exchanges aren't going to 'make good' and these attacks are more frequent than you think.

ADA,Binance,CARDANO (ADA) SET TO HIT $1.50 ON CLASSIC TRIANGLE BREAKOUT PATTERN,"KEY CARDANO TAKEAWAYS

Cardano’s ADA, now the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, maintains its top rankings as it sustains its uptrend three days in a row.

The ADA/USD exchange rate’s uptrend comes as a breakout-move of its previous Descending Triangle range.

That raises the pair’s potential to hit $1.50 in the coming sessions.

Ethereum’s top rival Cardano is on a tear.

The blockchain platform’s native asset, ADA, surged by up to 52 percent after bottoming out near $0.95 at the beginning of this week. As of Wednesday, the token has formed an intraday high of $1.45 before correcting mildly lower to the $1.35-1.44 range during the Asia-Pacific session Thursday

Traders flocked into the Cardano market after Bitcoin started correcting lower upon establishing its record high above $61,000.

ADA offered an ideal refuge against the top cryptocurrency after its listing on Coinbase Pro, a US-based digital assets trading platform. More bullish tailwinds for ADA came from the ongoing craze surrounding non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Cardano allows users to create the said assets on its blockchain following its latest “Mary” upgrade.

$1.50
Technical indicators added to the bullish confluence. The ADA/USD exchange rate’s latest move upside had it broke out of a Descending Triangle. Traders see the said structure as a bullish continuation pattern, primarily if the downside consolidation occurs after a strong move upward. ADA was trading higher before forming the Triangle.

Typically, a breakout move emerging out of a falling triangle structure leads the asset higher by as much as the maximum distance between the structure’s upper and lower trendline. In ADA’s case, the length spans about $0.47. If one adds $0.47 to the level from where the token has broken the Triangle, then the breakout target comes near $1.50.

“It is essential to note that the bullish outlook has been validated by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD),” said analysts at CoinGape, a crypto-focused YouTube channel. “The trend momentum indicator has crossed into the positive region, suggesting that the least resistance path is upward.”

Besides, the MACD line leads the way above the signal line, which is another bullish signal,” they added.

RISKS

On the flip side, the ADA/USD’s Relative Strength Indicator on the four-hour chart has entered the overbought territory. That increases the pair’s likelihood of correcting lower to neutralize short-term buying sentiments. Should a correction appear, Cardano risks correcting to its flipped resistance area of $1.26-1.29.


Meanwhile, fundamental risks also threaten to reverse ADA’s bullish course. The Cardano token has rallied majorly because of its rival Ethereum’s limitation as a blockchain project. The latter suffers from higher gas and transaction fees issues but remains committed to solve it by the end of this year through a long-awaited protocol upgrade from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.

One industry observer commented that he still has to see a single popular application operating atop the Cardano blockchain, unlike Ethereum, which boasts about projects like Tether and UniSwap. That makes ADA’s latest gains more speculative, prone to wavering.",8,2021-03-18 12:25:33,8

ADA,Binance,Binance holds ADA hostage!

It also indicates that crypto coins bought with those funds cannot be withdrawn until the ACH deposited funds are cleared. However I found this policy to be very inconsistently enforced. For example, for months I have been trying to withdraw ADA and Binance US constantly restricts this request because my funds are locked. However all ACh deposited funds to buy ADA have been cleared. So I thought it was the case that if I made AcH deposits to purchase other coins after I purchase ADA, ADA and all other coins will be locked for an additional 10 days. But this is not the case. I deposited UsD through ACH and immediately purchased BNB and USDT. And immediately I was able to withdraw BNB to an external wallet. So what is the deal here? Why is it that ADA is locked from being withdrawn while BNB and USDT can be withdrawn immediately after the ACH deposit? So I am suspecting that binance US does not want me to withdraw ADA.

ADA,Binance,"Hey quick question. I’ve noticed that BINANCE changed its staking rewards products. Is this normal, for example I’m currently staking ONE on binance for 15days with a 24.79%. They also had one for ADA but I can’t find it. Is it normal to remove the staking products do they come and go?",.,3,2021-06-16 20:38:39,5

ADA,Binance,How can Binance decrease interest for locked saving for ADA,"I cann't believe that Binance could lower APY interest of locked saving. More than 2 months ago, Binance introduced that user could get 17.49% APY for locking ADA 90 days. Recently, I realized that API was lower to around 15% APY, and now it continue to decrease to 11.89%. It is unacceptable.

ADA,Binance,How to sell ADA?,"Hey guys hope you doing well. Im a newbie at cryptocurrency game and just started last week. I bought 15 euros worth of cardano , and now i wanted to sell but it says i need to have at least 200 ADA coins to sell. I need to buy more cardano in order to sell?",2,2021-01-15 02:23:46,7
ADA,Binance,STOP STAKING ADA ON BINANCE!,The ammount of ADA staked into binance stake pools is insane. This is not good for the cardano network. If ada is to reach its goal of total decentralization people must stake responsibly. The cardano network intended for a diversified system of stake pools. Implemented protocols so that their would never be a monoply on ada stake pools. Stake pool operators will be able to vote on certain decisions that influence cardanos direction. With the ammount of ada staked on binance this gives binance a lot of voting power. Stake your cardano via daedalus or yoroi and delegate to a pool of your choosing. But never on an exchange or exodus. I know it might be easier but its not good for the network. If youre a cardano hodler and youre rooting for the success of ada. Stop staking on binance. Stake via daedalus or yoroi.,3,2021-04-15 07:00:45,5
