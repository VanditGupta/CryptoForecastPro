USDT,cryptocurrency,What's the situation with Tether?,"Are the printed Tether USD backed up legit? I haven't read any news lately ever since there was a controversy around it.

This question came back to me because there's a correlation between the recent BTC price surge and and total market cap of Tether.

Just asking a legit question, don't want to spoil anyone having fun and dopamine hits with the recent start of bull run.


To add to the question.. What's weird this time around is that dumb meme coins started pumping first. In previous bull runs, memecoins mooning was usually a indicator of bull run comming to an end.

**Backstory** : There was a coup in Myanmar(Burma) in February 2021. 99 percent of the national loathes the military. As of now there are two governments

1. The military regime (Holding power)
2. The exiled government (won the 2021 election, the cabinet members location unknown but rumoured to be in Thailand,Germany,US)[Daily Fights going on - guerrilla warfare, daily protests, civil strike, tons of atrocities committed by the regime](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/11/1105082)To read [about the coup](https://www.nytimes.com/article/myanmar-news-protests-coup.html)

Since the Military is in control, the junta has tight control over the banks and the internet. Everything is traceable so the government in exile has announced the news today to encourage people to start using USDT instead of the current official Myanmar Currency (KYAT).[Link to the announcement](https://www.facebook.com/MoPFINUG/photos/a.114937487404692/251267307105042)

USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether has not reported its supply for 3 days now. Its supply has also fell 8B in the 5 days before that.,"Tether is usually reports its supply on their official website once every day, at an inconsistent time. That's why you can see stairs like this on a market cap chart:

[Tether market cap in the past 7 days - not counting the depeg it's the same as the supply](https://preview.redd.it/dymvdlxi03091.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&s=098410d180c50328cbe0103ebc98317c3d72f917)

If you go to their website you can see their current circulating supply with the same latency:

[The last update date is not true - it's actually May 14 and the supply exactly the same as it was 3 days ago](https://preview.redd.it/1vtvjvqez2091.png?width=1298&format=png&auto=webp&s=390553ce99b2cdb44d12eb745cf9b3505c77c9aa)

So they're not only not reporting the supply, but they're also lying about updating it. The only reason why would they do that is because their supply fell significantly in these 3 days and they don't want more people to follow. If they didn't hide the 8B that dropped during 5 days, how much are they hiding from these 3 days?

Tether is getting more and more shady with everyday. They will probably try to buy back some of the withdrawn Tether with their reserves, decreasing their actual reserves and shooting themselves in the foot further. Of course Tether collapsing is not a good thing, many people will lose their money and a crypto crash will follow. Under any circumstances, don't hold Tether.",4108,2022-05-17 18:46:26,1180

>Tether USD₮ has been relied on as the primary form of dollar-based liquidity in the crypto market for many years and the crypto market has not been without its share of dramatic crashes! 

Like, what is this? They are saying they should be trusted entirely based on their track record, with no other explanation whatsoever??

&#x200B;

The first half of the page is useless, so what about the second half? 

The second half of the article is titled ""How Does an Algorithmic Stablecoin Work?"" and it's ALL they are talking about. 

>While UST is referred to as a stablecoin, it has nothing in common with collateralized stablecoins like Tether USD₮. UST is an algorithmic stablecoin. 

Again, they are using UST as a scapegoat instead of addressing their reserves or any explanation of how they maintain their peg.

The only source who would speak to Bloomberg is the person running Deltec bank in Bahamas, who could account for around 1/4th of Tether's money (around $15 BN) but stayed coy when quizzed on the other money.

Tether has never tried to explain where exactly their money is stashed. If their statements are true, they would be the world's 7th largest commercial paper holder, with almost $30 bn in this..but no one in wall street has heard of them.

All of this unfolded over the last few months, but just few hours ago the CEO of Tether has deleted his twitter account.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Understanding Tether: Why it accounts for a substantial part of the crypto market cap and why its the #1 outstanding issue in crypto markets today,"In this post I will go in-depth on:

1. How Tether got to be what it is today

2. Why Tether's market cap is a lot more than 0.5% of the total market cap for crypto you see on CoinMarketCap

3. Tether printing timing

4. Tether reserves

5. What could happen to the market if Tether is found to not be backed by reserves

Tether is incredibly important to the cryptocurrency market ecosystem and I've noticed far too few people understand what is going on. 

Very little actual discussion of the 2nd biggest crypto by volume happens here and whenever someone starts a discussion they most often got slapped for ""FUD"". Tether themselves recently hired the major New York based PR firm 5W to spread positive information online and take down critics, I'm sure some of their operatives are probably on Reddit.

But its absolutely critical you understand the risks behind Tether and especially now with the explosion in reserve liability, breakdown in relationship with banks and their auditor and recently announced subpoena. 


#What exactly is Tether and what happened so far?

Tether is a cryptocurrency asset issued by Tether Limited (incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and a sister company of Bitfinex), on top of the Bitcoin blockchain through the Omni Protocol Layer. It is meant to give people a ""stablecoin"", for example a merchant who accepts bitcoin but fears its volatility could shift bitcoin into tether, which can be easier to do than exchanging bitcoin for dollars. Recently they've also added an Ethereum-based ERC20 token. Tether Ltd claims that each one of the tokens issued is backed by actual US dollar (and more recently Euro) reserves. The idea is that when a business partner deposits US dollars in Tether’s bank account, Tether creates a matching amount of tokens and transfers them to that partner, it is NOT a fractional reserve system.

Tether makes the two following key promises in its whitepaper on which the entire premise is build:

> Each tether issued will be backed by the equivalent amount of currency unit (one USDTether equals
one dollar).

>Professional auditors will regularly verify, sign, and publish our underlying bank balance and financial transfer statement.

Tether is centralized and dependent on your trust of Bitfinex/Tether Limited, and that the people behind it are honest people. For the new entrants to this market it will be greatly beneficial understand the timeline of Tether and their connection to Bitfinex.

A brief timeline:

* Bitfinex operators Phil Potter and CFO Giancarlo Devasini set up Tether Limited in the British Virgin Islands, but told the public that Bitfinex and Tether are completely separate. Throughout 2015 and 2016, the amount of Tether stays relatively flat.

* In August 2nd, 2016, the second-largest digital currency exchange heist in history happened, when Bitfinex lost nearly 120,000 bitcoin. Bitfinex never revealed full details of the hack, but BitGo (the security company that had to sign off on the transactions) claims its servers were not breached.  

* Just 4 days after the hack Bitfinex “socializes” its losses from the theft by announcing a 36 percent haircut for almost all of its customers. In return, customers receive BFX tokens, initially valued at $1 each. 

* Two weeks after the hack Bitfinex announces it has hired Ledger Labs, to investigate the theft and perform a financial audit of its cryptocurrency and fiat assets. The public nevers sees the results of the investigation, and months later, Bitfinex admits it never actually hired Ledger Labs to perform an audit to begin with.   

* In May 2017, after long standing calls for an actual audit, Bitfinex hires Friedman LLP to ""complete a comprehensive balance sheet audit.""

* November 7, 2017: Leaked documents dubbed “Paradise Papers” reveal Bitfinex and Tether are run by the same individuals.

* November 19, 2017: Tether is hacked, with 31 million USDT suddenly disappearing. Tether Limited reacts to this by creating a hard fork.

* December 4, 2017: Right after hiring the PR firm 5W to help improve their image, Bitfinex hires law firm Steptoe & Johnson and threatens legal action against critics.

* December 6, 2017 - CFTC issues a subpoena to Tether and Bitfinex. This news isn't made public until the end of January. 

* December 21, 2017 : Without making any formal announcement, Bitfinex appears to suddenly close all new account registrations. Those trying to register for a new account are asked for a mysterious referral code, but no referral code seems to exist.

* After a month of being closed to new registrations, Bitfinex announces it is reopening its doors, but now requires new customers to deposit $10,000 before they can begin trading.

* Friedman LLP completely cut ties with Tether on January 27, 2017.

#Most common misconception: Tether is only a small part of the total market cap

One of the most common misconception people have about cryptocurrencies is that the ""market cap"" amount they see on CoinMarketCap.com is actually the amount of money that is invested in each coin. 

I often hear people online dismiss any issue with tether by simply claiming its not big enough to cause any effect, saying ""Well Tether is only $2.2 billion on CoinMarketCap and the market is 400 billion, its only 0.5% of the market"". 


But this misunderstands what market capitalization for cryptocurrency is, and just how different the market cap for Tether is to every other token. The market cap is simply the last trade price times the circulating supply. It doesn't take into account the order book depth at all. The majority of Bitcoin (and most coins) are held by those who either mined or purchased for a very low price early on and simply held on as very small portions of the total supply was rapidly bid up to their current price.

An increase in market cap of X does NOT represent an inflow of X dollars invested, not even close. A 400 billion dollar market cap for crypto does NOT mean that there is 400 billion dollars underwriting the assets. Meanwhile a 2 billion dollar Tether market cap means there should be exactly $2 billion backing up the asset.

Nobody can tell for sure exactly how much money has been invested in cryptocurrency market, but [analysts from JPMorgan](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-02/jpmorgan-has-some-bad-news-bitcoin-bears) found that there was only net inflow of $6 billion fiat that resulted in $300 billion market cap at the time. This gives us a roughly 50:1 ratio of market cap to fiat inflow.  Prominent crypto evangelist Julian Hosp [gives the following estimate](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/heres-why-market-capitalisation-is-a-bad-way-to-measure-a-cryptocurrencys-value-2018-1): ""For a cryptocurrency to have a market cap of $1 billion, maybe only $50 million actually moved into the cryptocurrency.""

For Tether however the market cap is simply the outstanding supply, 2.2 billion USDT is actually equal to 2.2 billion USD. In order to get $50 USDT you have to deposit $50 real U.S. dollars and then 50 completely new tokens will be issued, which never existed before on the market.

What is also often ignored is that Bitfinex allows margin trading, at a 3.3x leverage. Bitfinexed did an excellent analysis on how tether is entering Bitfinex to fund margin positions

There are $2.2 billion in Tether outstanding and the current market cap of the entire market is $400 billion according to CoinMarketCap. You can actually calculate Tether as a % of total fiat invested in the market according to the JP Morgan estimate, the following table outlines for a scenario of no margin lending and 15/25% of tether being on a 3.3x leverage margin account:

Fiat Inflow/Market Cap Ratio | Tether as % of total market (no margin) | Tether as % of total market (15% on margin) | Tether as % of total market (25% on margin) 
----------|----------------|----------------|----------------
JP Morgan estimate (50:1) | 27.5 % | 36.9 % | 43.3 %

Even without any margin lending Tether is underwriting the worth of about 27.5% of the cryptocurrency market, and if we assume only 25% was leveraged out at 3.3x on margin we have a whole 43% of the market cap being driven by Tether inflow.

A much better indicator on CoinMarketCap of just how influential Tether is actually the volume, i[ts currently the 2nd biggest cryptocurrency by volume](http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/volume/24-hour) and there are even days where its volume exceeds its market cap. 

What this all means is that not only is the market cap for cryptocurrencies drastically overestimating the amount of actual fiat capital that is underwriting those assets, but a **substantial portion of the entire market cap is being derived from the value of Tether's market cap rather than real money**.

Its incredibly important that more new investors realize that Tether isn't a side issue or a minor cog in the machine, but one of the core underlying mechanisms on which the entire market worth is built. **Ensuring that whoever controls this stablecoin is honest and transparent is absolutely critical to the health of the market.**

#Two main concerns with Tether

The primary concerns with Tether can be split into two categories:

1. Tether issuance timing - Does Tether Ltd issue USDT organically or is it timed to stop downward selling pressure? 

2. Reserves - Does Tether Ltd actually have the fiat reserves at a 1:1 ratio, and why is there still no audit or third party guarantee of this?


#Does Tether print USDT to prop up Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?

In the last 3 months the amount of USDT has nearly quadrupled, with nearly a billion being printed in January alone. Some people have found the timing of the most recent batch of Tether as highly suspect because it seemed to coincide with Bitcoin's price being propped up. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/bitfinex-bitcoin-price.html

This was recently analyzed statistically: 

>Author’s opinion - it is highly unlikely that Tether is growing through any organic business process, rather that they are printing in response to market conditions.

>Tether printing moves the market appreciably; 48.8% of BTC’s price rise in the period studied occurred in the two-hour periods following the arrival of 91 different Tether grants to the Bitfinex wallet. 

>Bitfinex withdrawal/deposit statistics are unusual and would give rise to further scrutiny in a typical accounting environment.

https://www.tetherreport.com

I'm still undecided on this and I would love to see more statistical analysis done, because the price of Bitcoin is so volatile while Tether printing only happens in large batches. Simply looking at the Bitcoin price graph over the last 3 months and then the Tether printing its pretty clear there is a relationship but it doesn't seem to hold over longer periods.

Ultimately to me this timing isn't that much of an issue, as long Tether is backed by US dollars. If Bitfinex was timing the prints then it accounts to not much more than an organized pumping scheme, which isn't a fundamental problem. The much more serious concern is whether those buy order are being conducted on the faith of fictitious  dollars that don't exist, regardless of when those buy orders occur.


#Didn't Tether release an audit in September?

Some online posters have recently tried to spread the notion that Tether has actually been audited by Friedman LLP and that a report was released in September 2017. That was actually just a consulting engagement, which you can read here:

https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf

They clearly state that:

>This engagement does not contemplate tests of accounting records or the performance of other procedures performed in an audit or attest engagement. Our procedures performed are not for the purpose of providing assurance...In addition, our services do not include determination of compliance with laws and regulations in any jurisdiction. 

They state right from the beginning that this is a consultancy job (not an audit), and that its not meant to be assurance to third parties. Doing a consultancy job is just doing a task asked by your customer. In a consultancy job you take information as true from the client, and you have no mandate to verify whether your customer's claims are true or not. The way they checked is simply asking Tether to provide them the information:

>All inquiries made through the consulting process have been directed towards, and the data obtained from, the Client and personnel responsible for maintaining such information.

Tether provided a screenshots of twp bank balances. One of these is in the name of Tether Limited, and while the other is a personal account of an individual who Tether Limited claims has a trust agreement with them:

>As of September 15, 2017, the bank held $60,919,810 in **an account in the name of an in individual for the benefit of Tether Limited**. FLPP obtained an engagement letter for an interim settlement plan between that individual and Tether Limited and that **according to Tether Limited, is the relevant agreement with the trustee. FLLP did not evaluate the substance of the letter and makes no representation about its legality.**

Even worse is that later on in Note 1, they clearly claim that there is no actual evidence that this engagement letter or trust has any legal merit:

>**Note 1: FLLP makes no representations about sufficiency or enforceability of any trust agreement between the trustee and the Client**

Essentially what this is saying is that the trust agreement may not even be worth the paper it’s printed on. 

And most importantly… Note 2:

>“**FLLP did not evaluate the terms of the above bank accounts and makes no representations about the clients ability to access funds from the accounts or whether the funds are committed for purposes other than Tether token redemptions**”

Basically Tether gave them a name of an individual with $60 million in their account according to a screenshot, Tether then gave them a letter saying that there is a trust agreement between this individual and Tether Limited. They also have account with $382 million but no guarantee that this account holds to any lien or other commitments, or that it can be accessed. 

Currently Tether has 2.2 billion USDT outstanding and we have absolutely no idea whether this is actually backed by anything, and the long promised audit is still outstanding.


# What happens if its revealed that Tether doesn't have its US dollar reserves?

According to Thomas Glucksmann, head of business development at Gatecoin: ""If a tether debacle unfolds, it will likely cause quite a devastating ripple effect across many of the exchanges that see most of their volumes traded against the supposedly USD-backed cryptocurrency.""

According to Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley: ""You could see a spike in prices in tether-only bitcoin exchanges. So, on those exchanges only you will see a run up in price compared to the bitcoin exchanges that actually work with actually money. So you would see a huge price diverge as people see that only way they can turn tether into real money is to buy other cryptocurrency then move to another exchange. That is a bank run.""

I definitely see the crypto equivalent of a bank run, as people actually try to secure their gains an realize that this money doesn't actually exist within the system:

> If traders lose confidence in it and its value starts to drop, “people will run for the door,” says Carlson, the former Wall Street trader. If Tether can’t meet all its customers’ demand for dollars (and its Terms of Service suggest that in many cases it won’t even try), tether holders will try to snap up other cryptocurrencies instead, temporarily causing prices for those currencies to soar. With tether’s role as an inter-exchange facilitator compromised, investors might lose faith in cryptocurrencies more generally. “At the end of the day, people would be losing substantial sums, and in the long term this would be very bad for cryptocurrencies,” says Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell professor and co-director of its Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts.

>Another concern is that Bitfinex might simply shut down, pocketing the bitcoins it has allegedly been stockpiling. Because people who trade on Bitfinex allow the exchange to hold their money while they speculate, these traders could face substantial losses. “The exchanges are like unregulated banks and could run off with everyone’s money,” says Tony Arcieri, a former Square employee turned entrepreneur trying to build a legally regulated exchange.

https://www.wired.com/story/why-tethers-collapse-would-be-bad-for-cryptocurrencies/

The way I see it, this would be how it plays out if Tether collapses:

1. Tether-enabled exchanges will see a massive spike in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices as everyone leaves Tether. Noobs in these exchanges will think they are now millionaires until they realize they are rich in tethers but poor in dollars.

2. Exchanges that have not integrated Tether will experienced large drops in Bitcoin and alts as experienced investors flee crypto into USD. 

3. There will be a flight of Bitcoin from Tether-integrated exchanges to non-Tether exchanges with fiat off-ramps. Exchanges running small fractional reserves will be exposed, further increasing calls for greater reserves requirements.

4. The exchanges might slam the doors shut on withdrawals.

5. Many exchanges that own large balances of Tether, especially Bitfinex, will likely become insolvent. 

6. There will be lawsuits flying everywhere and with Tether Limited being incorporated on a Carribean Island whose solvency and bankruptcy laws will likely ensure they don't ever get much back. This could take years and potentially push away new investors from entering the space.

#Conclusion

We can't be 100% completely sure that Tether is a scam, but its so laiden with red flags that at this point I would call it the biggest systematic risk in the crypto space. Its bigger than any nation's potential regulatory steps because it cuts right into the issue of trust across the entire ecosystem.

Ultimately Tether is centralizing one of the very core mechanics of the cryptocurrency markets and asking you to trust one party to be the safekeeper, and I really see very little reason to trust Bitfinex given their history of lying and screwing over their own customers. I think that Tether initially started as a legit business to facilitate the ease of moving money and avoiding regulations, but somewhere along the lines greed and/or incompetence took over (something that seems common with Bitfinex's previous actions). Right now we're playing proverbial hot potato, and as long as people believe that Tether is worth a dollar everything is fine, but as some point the Emperor will have to step out from hiding and somebody will point out they have no clothes.

In the long term I really hope once Tether collapses we can move on and get the following two implemented which would greatly improve the market for all investors:

1. Actual USD fiat pairings on the major exchanges for the major currencies

2. Regulatory rules on exchange reserve requirements 

I had watched the Bitconnect people insist for the last 2 years that everything about Bitconnect made perfect sense because they were getting paid daily. The scam works until one day it suddenly doesn't. 

Tether could still come clean and avoid all of this ""FUD"" by simply getting a simple review of their banking, they don't even need a full audit. If everything was legit with Tether, it would be incredibly easy to have a segregated bank account with the funds used solely to back up Tether, then have an third party accounting firm simply review the account and a bank reconciliation statement then spend a few hours in contact with the bank to ensure no outstanding liabilities are held on that balance. This is extremely basic stuff, it would take a few hours to set up and wouldn't take a lot of man-hours for a qualified account to do, and yet they don’t do it. Why? Why hire a major PR firm and spend god knows how much money to pay professional PR representatives to attack ""FUD"" online instead?

I think I know why.

This actually makes it $6 Billion Tether has minted in almost a month, definitely making it a fast mint rate for Tether.

Some might be quick to speculate if this is (more?) fraudulent activity by Tether. Whether you believe them to have been guilty of any of the accusations over the years, or not, is a different matter from what I wish to point out. Although on that point, Tether has come quite a ways into being *somewhat* more transparent and complying with regulation, properly backed issuance and being more trustworthy on the whole.

I see these mints as a hugely bullish sign. Tether would only seek to mint this huge amount of funds if there was demand for it. After all, more supply only dilutes prices and profits, even for the tiny margin that stablecoins trade off of. Meanwhile,Tether has only gained market share while other stablecoins have lost it. Therefore, stablecoins being a base that underpins almost all crypto trading pairs, any change in the market would be reflected mostly, and disproportionately so, in Tether's statistics and on-chain data. This is to say that the huge minting by Tether is a indicator or proxy for a massive surge in demand in crypto in general.

While this may not necessarily be big breaking news, it is still a huge confirmation. As we all obviously know that there is much more crypto demand, and where this demand came from. But it is a big bullish sign nevertheless.

It is harder to state if this new money ill be ""activated"" in price in non-stablecoin crypto tokens and cause those tokens' price appreciation, or buyers were simply looking to lock their money away in a dollar pegged-asset just to get away from banks, But even if  it sits only in dollar-pegged assets, some significant portion of it will eventually make it into non-stablecoins and Bitcoin as traders get more comfortable.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Stop holding fiat in Tether if you haven't already!,"Tether, often referred to as USDT are tokens minted by Tether Limited which is owned by the same people who own Bitfinex. It is designed to always have the value of 1 US dollar but cryptocurrency format. They supposedly achieve this by keeping 1 dollar in reserves for each Tether bought. Tether is not the only crypto that has its value pegged to 1 dollar, there are many, i.e., stablecoins. But Tether is by far the most popular. Nearly all crypto exchanges use USDT as a trading pair. What this means is, USDT is the main liquidity provider of the cryptocurrency market.

Currently, there is **68,5 BILLION** Tether in circulation, it is the **5th largest cryptocurrency** by market cap.

Now everything sounds great on paper, 1 dollar for every Tether and all of that. But in reality, Tether Limited is the single sketchiest company that has ever managed to get enormously big. Tether limited has 68,5 billion dollars under management and they have, wait for it, **19 employees.**

This means that for every employee Tether has, they control **3,6 billion dollars.**

If you don't understand what this means, let me put it this way:

In case of Tether crashing, the whole crypto market would be devastated and put back multiple years, all the innovation that crypto aims to bring would be stained by the fiasco that is Tether. I'm certain that we would say goodbye to crypto going mainstream and becoming the main way of finance dreams for a loooong time.

There are several huge red flags about how they manage the company and their reserves.

Let me talk these red flags:

They've refused multiple audits to their currency and reserves. Only info until now that us investors had about the situation of their reserves was a half-assed promise the co- founder made in an interview. 

In that same interview, he was asked if Bitfinex and Tether Limited had the same owners, he replied that they weren't related at all, they only worked with the same banks. Well guess what, **he lied.** The truth came out when the Paradise Papers were leaked, shining light to many corporations', elites' and celebrities' and also Tether's secrets.

Bitfinex got mixed up in a scandal involving a firm called Crypto Capital, an also shady fiat banking firm that has worked with even shadier clients, including Colombian Drug lords. This firm was unsurprisingly involved in a sex-trafficking scandal and the investigation that followed caused all their clients' holdings to be frozen indefinitely. 

Suddenly Bitfinex had nearly 80 percent of their clients money frozen, rendering any withdravals or trades impossible. Now normally a normal exchange in this situation would declare bankruptcy right? No. What Bitfinex did is that they took 400 million dollars worth of Tether's reserves to provide liquidity to their clients.

Remember when I said that no audits were done until now? 

The New York Attorney General launched an investigation on Tether Limited, and they reached a settlement. As a part of that settlement, Tether had to share their holdings completely. 

Here's the result:

&#x200B;

Yup, they have **3.87% in cash.**

There are a lot more sketchy stuff Tether is involved in, but I will not talk about them. This article is long enough. 

If you want to dive deeper about Tether, please watch the video made by Coffezilla on Youtube.

What I want to finally say is, please don't hold fiat in Tether, hold it in **USDC** or even better, **DAI**. These are far better alternatives. People have already started campaings to move people to other stablecoins and I want to support that and raise awareness. 

Please do the responsible thing and don't hold USDT.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Coinbase is attacking Tether now while Binance is attacking every other exchange and Kraken is attacking Binance. We are literally having a war with ourselves right now.,"The amount of conflicts that especially the FTX collapse set on is not summarize-able in any way. But to just say that literally every entity in crypto is out after another entity before they get attacked themselves. I know all of this just sounds like gibberish but here is an part of that big conflict as an example:

How did this all start? Well, Binance attacked FTX on the basis of some leaks, then they won this battle and went on to attack other exchanges like CDC or Coinbase and said that they don't have any proof of reserves themselves (meanwhile even binance themselves did not have a proper one). Then Kraken stepped in and rightfully showed CZ his place by saying that his Proof of Reserves are ""pointless"" as there were no liabilities included.

This is just a very small part of this ""war"" as you may call it, in which crypto is fighting with itself and many may think that this is bad but it actually is not...

At the end of the day such conflicts will only come down to whoever was telling the truth and who not. If it escalates further there will surely be blood sheld but rightfully some. It could be that the exchanges actually lying to us like FTX did (there are surely more left) will just get the same treatment as FTX.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether is a $65 billion time bomb waiting to explode,"Tether has a shady history. CoffeZilla did a good summary of it here: https://youtu.be/-whuXHSL1Pg

Tether’s whole spiel is that it’s a stablecoin that’s backed 1-1 to the US dollar. In theory, you could ask to exchange all your Tethers for US dollars and they should be able to provide that. 

The only problem is Tether has never had a full audit. They almost did complete an audit from Friedman LLP in 2018 but fired the auditor because he was “excruciatingly detailed”. More on that here: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/01/27/tether-confirms-its-relationship-with-auditor-has-dissolved/?outputType=amp

Every now and then, when Tether is bombarded with questions about its reserves, it will release an attestation but an attestation is nowhere near as detailed or critical as an audit. 

Last year Tether was barred from operating in New York following a $18.5 million settlement with NY AG alleging it had been involved in a $850 million coverup with shadow bank Crypto Capital in 2017. More on this here: https://blockworks.co/news/tether-pushes-back-timeline-on-audit-report

The owners of Tether also owned Bitfinex, the once very popular crypto exchange. The execs who owned the Tether coin and also owned the crypto exchange would swap money between these two places to put up a front for the public that the reserves were there. From Bitfinex to Crypto Capital, there’s so many shady dealings it’s actually surprising how Tether is still keep the scheme alive.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Tethers marketcap has hit an new all time high of over $85bn,"According to coinmarketcap, Tether's market cap just jumped $0.5bn in the last day, taking it to a new all time high of $85bn+

It is now apparently the third largest crypto by market cap with the vast majority of its volume stemming from Binance.

In just 3.5 years Tethers market cap has rocketed from just $4.64bn at the end of March 2020 to over $85bn today (+1700%).

The next closest in 4th position by m/cap is Binance's own token BNB at $34.57bn which has seen its own marketcap rocket from $6.55bn from Jan 2021 to $34.56bm today (+420%).

These figures are despite Binance facing it's toughest global regulatory clampdowns for many years. 

If we compare this against the rest of the top ten....

Bitcoin (1st) end of September 2020 it's market cap increased from $199bn to $671bn today (+237%)

Ethereum (2nd), $64bn in December 20 to $216bn today (+237%).

Tether (3rd) 4.64bn aMarch 2020 to $85bn today **(+1700%)**

BNB (4th) $6.55bn from Jan 2021 to $34.56bm today (+420%).

XRP (5th) $11.55bn in Nov 20 to $32.67bn today (+182%).

USDC (6th) $3.24bn in Dec 2020 to $24.49bn today (+655%).

This is another stable coin like tether that's supposed to be backed by dollar reserves like Tether. Again volumes going through Binance are hugely disproportionate to other exchanges.

Solana (7th) $1.6bn Feb 21 to $16.6bn today (+937%).

Cardano (8th) $5bn Dec 20 to $11.26bn today (+125%)

Dogecoin (9th) $1.13bn Jan 21 to $9.57 today (+746%)

Tron (10th) 1.82bn Nov 20 to $8.68bn today (+376%).

**Conclusion**

The +1700% increase of Tethers market cap compared the rest of the top ten is vastly significant and therefore I'd suggest questionable. Most of its volume appears to be going through Binance.

Questions over tether and it's backing are long standing. Out of the whole industry Tether and it's reserves need to face tougher scrutiny by regulators and government before it's too late. This is one stablecoin that could destabilise and corrupt the full crypto market. 

I believe all fiat based stablecoins should be clearly and verifiably backed 1:1 only by actual fiat currency cash accounts held at major regulated financial institutions and insuranced in their entirety before being allowed to be listed on crypto exchanges in order to safeguard the rest of the Crypto markets/ industry.

If a rush on capital occurs on the exchange, some serious dominoes are going to fall...and you will likely get boned.

And also not news that Tether is being ""backed"" only by some suspiciously unknown (most likely fractional) percentage of cash and  ""commercial paper"" from unknown entities. [https://www.coindesk.com/tether-first-reserve-composition-report-usdt](https://www.coindesk.com/tether-first-reserve-composition-report-usdt)

Binance is currently holding $17 BILLION Tether in its wallet. [https://wallet.tether.to/richlist](https://wallet.tether.to/richlist) .

The cycle seems something like this: Binance puts up some amount of collateral to Tether Treasury (likely some cash with the rest ""commercial paper""). Tether prints more Tether, loans it to Binance. Binance uses the new magic minted tether to give margin traders higher leverage to buy more Bitcoin....Bitcoin price goes up, more capital comes in, never ending cycle continues.  You should get the picture why this is bad without the word ""PONZI""

Multiple countries are once again cracking down on Binance. We've seen this happen before, but there's no certainty regulators won't come down harder this time. Any number of things could trigger a rush of withdrawals (eg. a margin-call on all leveraged accounts) from Binance

IF there is a sudden rush of withdrawals from Binance for whatever reason (and that rush coincides with a drop in Bitcoin prices), the exchange is going to have a dual monster on their hands. Say the US and EU regulators decide to team up to hit Binance/Binance.US with some mega regulations.

Coinciding with a decrease in BTC price, they're also going to be margin-calling a ton of those leverage accounts...inevitably resulting in heavily forced liquidations (to USDT). 

If that worst-case scenario happens, at some point they're also going to have to try to redeem all that tether they're holding for cash. But...as we've recently learned, Tether does not likely have any account with billions of dollars in liquid cash available, and Binance has an ""IOU"" with them anyway....so Tether says ""sorry Binance, you have this on loan, you're SOL"".

There is no telling how leveraged Binance is in unbacked Tethers.

So what does Binance do when they can't get liquidity to facilitate withdrawals?

It's not that unrealistic of a story given the current environment. If you need to use Binance, it should be a quick in and out.  Until things chill out with the regulatory environment, leaving any coins in there is asking to get burned.

**edit**

This post seems to have ruffled some feathers. To be clear I’m not saying this scenario will definitely play out. I’m saying this is a not impossible risk that exists with Binance, and there is no point absorbing the risk when alternatives to storing your coins exist. 

If you’re someone who thinks acknowledging and discussing risk is automatically “FUD”, and this sort of topic scares you, maybe investing in a high risk asset like crypto isn’t for you?",663,2021-07-18 00:22:07,587
USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether was hacked by the same person who hacked Bitstamp in 2015,"Decided to have a look at what we could learn about the Tether hack from the blockchain, the coins are still moving around so I may edit this later as this develops.

It actually starts with this wallet here:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/12f4885dad525cc1

Look familiar? Go to the last page, that was the wallet used to steal 19000BTC from Bitstamp back in January 2015 (and which was still receiving coins from Bitstamp as recently as September, well done guys).

This wallet made two transactions, the first is fairly innocuous but I'll come back to it later:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/7b46c7e412b1f1e93ff0aa67232457dde3fb6e91f4c61e025a97e56290049050

This address then sends out a further 0.01BTC:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1LBQpqUTEmdPTH8adaV6xS8KQt6FGCD3xD

The following morning it sends 0.01 to the address that was several hours later used to empty the Tether wallet:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

I'm not quite sure why they would make a deposit like this to it hours before - perhaps to test that everything is working?

*Edit: I think these payments were to ensure that they had BTC available to pay the fees needed to move that Tether as soon as they got it*

At 10:53, the wallet makes several transactions transferring 23 million tethers from the tether wallet:

Then at 11:10 they transfer another 7.9 million tethers. A further 50,000 tethers are transferred over at 11:54.

At 12:01, 5BTC (the bulk of the bitcoin in the tether wallet) is transferred over to the same address:

These tethers are then transferred over to the address in the Tether announcement as their relevant blocks are confirmed.

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r

The 5BTC is also transferred to this address in amounts of roughly 1BTC per transaction:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

Following the BTC along, you arrive back at an address from before, which is confirmed to be part of the wallet holding the stolen Tether:

It's worth noting that this same address was just used to create an Omni token called lioncoin:

The BTC from the tether wallet ended up in these addresses:

I will update this post as more develops.

*Edit 1*

This wallet from the Tether and Bitstamp hacks seems to be owned by the same person who took 12000BTC out of Huobi in late 2015, interesting...

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d

*Edit: Huobi are saying this is not a hack, so who knows why 12000 or so bitcoin was withdrawn from their exchange and combined with the coins from bitstamp [see here](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d) before being passed through several more wallets and onto BTC-e in batches of 1000 or so.*

Before he was taking thousands of BTC off exchanges and sending it to BTC-e, he also used to sell much smaller amounts on Localbitcoins.

So Localbitcoins guys, if you have a log of who was using [this address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1EvTV4ySZbwwsRfL6T723cg1iiFASJbqH3) back in 2015, you've got the hacker ;)

*Edit 2*

So I was [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7eho5y/tether_was_hacked_by_the_same_person_who_hacked/dq558sd/) whether this could be an inside job.

Well, maybe? I don't think there's enough evidence from chain analysis alone to draw a conclusion.

Some of the transactions which funded the lioncoin address came from an old Bitfinex wallet, and [some came from the bitstamp hack address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/6b1a2139799a82b8). Bear in mind that this is [part of the same wallet](https://blockchain.info/tx/eeaf8b9c6288c28c481d6e37d687b5c42b0222fb3d8a73bdca81c1a12243c579) that the stolen tethers were sent to.

Also if you look at the [tether address](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=3BbDtxBSjgfTRxaBUgR2JACWRukLKtZdiQ&page=1) you'll notice that when other blocks of tether were released they were quickly transferred to the Bitfinex wallet, with this 30 million being the exception, that said in prior months they had regularly left millions of tether in this address for days at a time, so this isn't necessarily a red flag.

It could be that the attacker had access to the main tether issuance address (3MbYQMM etc) or it may just be that they noticed the 30 million tethers sat on the wallet that they could manipulate. Presumably Tether know whether or not they intended to make [this](https://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=dbde10653dd7f459260c11e2a80ae887f7c72e5bfd22f5d908b489dd430be764) transaction. Without knowing that we can only speculate on whether the compromise went beyond the address that was emptied.

*Edit 3*

There is a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tether/comments/7ei568/tether_return/) in which a /u/bitconexfoier1 claims to have bought 10M tethers, and provides an address that [received 10 million tethers](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=13kyHqsbtZpRHDNSdXWniJiCZPvRtMjVao) (now invalid) from the hackers.

I know that the cryptocurrency space has been generally weary weary of us. Despite us doing audits from people that *we* trust.

Look. It was hard for us to back the asset 1:1 with a dollar. That shit is mad worthless these days. We did so initially. And it was the plan. But you know, things happen.

But we have heard you guys out. You guys want to know WHAT our tokens are backed by. You DON'T want it backed by ""commercial paper"" and other fun things. We will do an ""actual"" audit soon. 

This is why we shall just swap all 70 billion USDT with DAI, which IS backed by US dollars. Doing some simple math,

USDT = DAI = USD

 USDT = USD

USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether is responsible for the MAJORITY of crypto trading volume. This means you will NOT BE SAFE from Tether collapse/fraud uncovering even if you don't hold any.,"Tether is responsible for the majority of crypto trading volume.

&#x200B;

Over the past 24 hours Tether had a trading volume of U$ 79,942,874,644 dollars. Bitcoin had U$ 34,764,002,915 dollars traded, and ETH had U$ 19,402,373,410 dollars.

&#x200B;

**That means Tether trading volume corresponds to 1.5 times that of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Added together.** There are also days (like yesterday) where it's closer to 2 times.

&#x200B;

If you think you'll dodge a Tether crash by ""nOt HoLDinG UsdT"" you're so very mistaken, because a Tether collapse would mean much less market action, and that would make prices less stable (probably on the downside, since a big fraud would be uncovered).

&#x200B;

Tether also claimed they hold cryptoassets on their reserves that back USDT. This means that:

* Client gives Tether 10 USD, gets 10 USDT
* Client uses 10 USDT to buy $10 of Bitcoin
* Tether uses the USD to buy $10 of Bitcoin to *back* the USDT they gave the client.
* Essentially every USD is used to buy Bitcoin twice, meaning there's leverage and the Bitcoin float price is probably, at least, twice what it should be.

^(PS: For the bullet point analogy right above I'm considering Tether holds) *^(only Bitcoin)* ^(as their reserve asset of choice to back USDT. In the past they claimed to have a portion of USD, a portion in Crypto and a few other assets, but from what I remember on their pizza chart Cryptoassets were over half of their reserves.)

&#x200B;

In case of a collapse/fraud uncovering the market will dry up and prices will correct on the downside as people realize they were artificially inflated by a fraudulent company.",536,2021-09-11 22:04:15,459

Is it something to do with the ongoing freedom on information request for information on Tethers reserves?

Coindesk has joined a suit between NYAG and Tether to allow NYAG to release documents regarding Tethers reserves to news media outlets.

Now, individual action of moving off Tether will help - but it can only scale so far. I think we need to organize this effort as a community - perhaps even creating a subreddit dedicated to the untethering ~~(I thought about creating it already, but decided to make this post instead.)~~

USDT,cryptocurrency,"For all you hoping for tether to die a quick and spectacular death, what do you think is going to happen?","Been seeing even more “rip the bandaid off” and more amateur sleuthing into how tether is worthless/smoke and mirrors. Some have gone so far to call tether a cancer that must die for crypto to ascend to some magical new ath. 

Personally, I acknowledge that they aren’t a model coin and do have suspicious backing/audit history, but I’m not rooting for their outright implosion. I seriously think people underestimate the ripple effects throughout crypto that would happen if USDT went bust. Something like 60-70% of all BTC volume is done through USDT and it’s a massive part of crypto volume in general. It this goes up in smoke, then exchanges can go under and volume would dry up considerably. This would lead to massive price drops and liquidity crises that would give governments free reign to completely shape crypto with whatever regulations they see fit. 

I’d prefer for USDT to slowly be replaced by USDC/DAI/etc and be less influential rather than the above scenario. Why do so many people think that USDT going bust would only cause short term pain?

USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether Reports Record Net Profit of $2.9 Billion in Q4 2023,"Tether, a leading stablecoin issuer, has achieved remarkable financial milestones in its **Q4 2023** attestation report, disclosing **a record net profit of $2.9 billion**. Conducted by global auditing firm BDO, the report also underscores an unprecedented increase in **excess reserves, soaring to $5.4 billion.**

The substantial net operating profit of approximately $1 billion in the latest quarter can largely be attributed to **holdings in U.S. Treasuries,** with additional gains stemming from the appreciation of Tether’s **bitcoin and gold reserves** during the same period.

Tether has achieved a remarkable net profit of $6.2 billion for the entire year. Additionally, the company has expanded its cryptocurrency holdings by acquiring **an additional 8,888 bitcoins in Q4**, **totaling approximately 66,465 BTC, currently valued at around $2.8 billion**

The profit surge has boosted Tether’s **excess reserves** by $2.2 billion, now **totaling $5.4 billion**. Notably, these reserves are allocated for project investments, spanning initiatives in mining, AI infrastructure, and P2P communications, separate from Tether’s considered reserves.

BDO’s attestation has confirmed that Tether’s outstanding unsecured loans of $4.8 billion at year-end were fully covered by the excess reserves. Tether, in response to community concerns, has emphasized the removal of risk associated with secured loans from its token reserves, despite their overcollateralization.

As of December 31, Tether’s **consolidated reserves have exceeded $97 billion**, including $80.3 billion in U.S. Treasuries and $3.5 billion in gold. The consolidated liabilities related to digital tokens issued stood at $91.6 billion, with **90% backed by cash or cash equivalents.**

Such successful financial results **are promising for the crypto industry**. It’s worth remembering that Tether USDT processed $18.2 trillion worth of transactions in 2022, surpassing even VISA and Mastercard. Both of these companies are adapting to new crypto reality - example can be their collaboration with CEXs and creation of Bybit Card(With MasterCard) and Binance Card, [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) Visa Card, WhiteBIT Card, CoinBase Card (these with VISA)",191,2024-02-07 07:26:07,143
USDT,cryptocurrency,"With the news Tether isn't *gasp* backed 1:1 with USD in a bank account, it seems like a good time to talk about Dai","For those that are unaware, Dai is a decentralized stable coin that lives 100% on-chain with no 3rd party custody.

Unlike Tether you don't have to trust they are solvent, you don't have to trust them to not exit scam, you don't have to trust the local government not to freeze their account.

Dai is not backed 1:1 with the USD, Dai is backed 1:1.5 with USD (in Ether). 

It basically works by someone locking up their Ether in a smart contract, and then you are able to draw Dai against your Ether. If your collateral is ever less than 150% of the Dai you've drawn then you get liquidated and your Dai is repaid by someone who bought your Ether. It is this mechanism which ensures Dai is always backed by real value.

CDPs (the smart contract to draw Dai) allow you to borrow money from yourself! The best part is, the thing you borrow is a fully backed stablecoin pegged to the USD!

It's the best thing to happen to Bitcoin since Ethereum in my opinion.

A stable, decentralized, permissionless p2p cryptocurrency is what Bitcoin's original mission was all about! It basically takes the best part of Bitcoin but removes the volatility, which is a major barrier to global adoption.

Don't take my word for it, please check out this link which has dozens of articles, explanations, critiques, refutations of critiques, and other documentation that can let you make up your own mind that this is as cool as I am saying.   

https://github.com/makerdao/awesome-makerdao/blob/master/README.md

Let me know if you have any questions I'm always happy to chat about Dai. 

Edit: I highly recommend you go over to http://cdp.makerdao.com and try out the system for yourself! All you need is a Metamask account (chrome browser extension) and some ETH. It's incredible. 

Edit 2: This is a great high level overview of Dai given from a talk by MakerDao's Andy Milenius. Highly recommend!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lxc7qCsvF8

Edit 3: I have to give a shoutout to Austin Griffith and the burner wallet! It's an awesome browser based wallet that uses the xDai side chain to have instant transactions in Dai. Try it out on your phone browser at http://xDai.io The idea is that you accept or pay in small amounts (less than $50) and at the end of the day sweep the funds into cold storage. It's called a burner wallet because when you're done you burn the private key and it generates a new burner wallet right away. It's super cool. It's run on a 'Proof of Authority' network with several respected teams in the Ethereum space, so it's centralized, but the idea is you only use it as a hot wallet for small amounts.

Anyways, what is this thread about?

&#x200B;

So remember when Binance ( [CZ tweet](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1123048279124500480) ) was saying that it was moving its funds to another address with ***ONE LARGE transaction***? Well it turns out that did not happen! The original address has been drained with about 10 transactions to the new address. But hold on, the new address only has *42M Tether* at the time of writing this and the original one had over 780M! So where did the rest go?? The answer: Different addresses, thousands of them.

&#x200B;

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAOX7Hcdrag&t=1s) explains all of it perfectly and has all the evidence you need ( skip to 1:00 if you dont want to hear the troll song intro ). Please watch the video before calling me a FUDster or shill or whatever. You guys have no idea what is going on behind the scene and the person in the video has done some solid research. There is no point in repeating everything he says in text form.

I find it quite suspicious that this is all happening in the same period as when Ifinex is having difficult times. The parent company of Bitfinex called Ifinex owns both Tether and Bitfinex. For the people who didnt know Tether [is getting sued](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/attorney-general-james-announces-court-order-against-crypto-currency-company-under) by the New York State Attorney General for covering up a loss of $850M.

All of this leads to uncertainty and no wonder that over 30k BTC has been withdrawn from Bitfinex the past couple of days as you can see from the photo below. People are getting their funds off the exchange and are putting it in cold storage/sending it to other exchanges.

https://i.redd.it/bg93u5zh8dw21.png

' Thats just a coincidence dude what are you talking about stop fudding dude.  '

Well explain why not only BTC is getting withdrawn but Ethereum as well, and LOOK at how much is being withdrawn. Thats over 40% withdrawn in the last week on ***Ethereum***. The BTC price pump, Binance Tether transactions and the NYSAG investigation of fraud is all happening at the same time and no one is batting an eye.

You can dislike them using low risk investments to make money off the cash they are holding to back their assets, but saying they are pumping BTC to print more to buy more BTC is just patently false.   What they are doing is generating value for their share holders through low risk investments, and generating funds they need to pay for operations, holding cash won't do that.

The commercial paper is generally the sticking point for a lot of people, and that's fair (see: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialpaper.asp) as it is an unsecured loan, if those companies go belly up they will need to fight in court as a creditor to recover funds.

Tether Critical Announcement
 
Yesterday, we discovered that funds were improperly removed from the Tether treasury wallet through malicious action by an external attacker. Tether integrators must take immediate action, as discussed below, to prevent further ecosystem disruption.

$30,950,010 USDT was removed from the Tether Treasury wallet on November 19, 2017 and sent to an unauthorized bitcoin address. As Tether is the issuer of the USDT managed asset, we will not redeem any of the stolen tokens, and we are in the process of attempting token recovery to prevent them from entering the broader ecosystem. The attacker is holding funds in the following address: 16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r. If you receive any USDT tokens from the above address, or from any downstream address that receives these tokens, do not accept them, as they have been flagged and will not be redeemable by Tether for USD.  

The following steps have been taken to address this matter:

The tether.to back-end wallet service has been temporarily suspended. A thorough investigation on the cause of the attack is being undertaken to prevent similar actions in the future.
We are providing new builds of Omni Core to the community. (Omni Core is the software used by Tether integrators to support Omni Layer transactions.) These builds should prevent any movement of the stolen coins from the attacker’s address. We strongly urge all Tether integrators to install this software immediately to prevent the coins from entering the ecosystem. Again, any tokens from the attacker’s address will not be redeemed. Accordingly, any and all exchanges, wallets, and other Tether integrators should install this software immediately in order to prevent loss:

https://github.com/tetherto/omnicore/releases/tag/0.2.99.s

Note that this software will cause a consensus change to currently running Omni Core clients, meaning that it is effectively a temporary hard fork to the Omni Layer. Integrators running this build will not accept any token sends from the attacker’s address, preventing the coins from moving further from the attacker’s address.
We are working with the Omni Foundation to investigate ways that will allow Tether to reclaim stranded tokens and rectify the hard fork created by the above software. Once this protocol enhancement is complete, the Omni Foundation will provide updated binaries for all integrators to install. These builds will supersede the binaries provided above by Tether.to. After the protocol upgrades to the Omni Layer are in place, Tether will reclaim the stolen tokens and return them to treasury.
Tether issuances have not been affected by this attack, and all Tether tokens remain fully backed by assets in the Tether reserve. The only tokens that will not be redeemed are the ones that were stolen from Tether treasury yesterday. Those tokens will be returned to treasury once the Omni Layer protocol enhancements are in place. 

We will provide further updates as they come available, and we appreciate the community’s patience, understanding, and support while we work to rectify the situation in the best possible manner to everyone’s benefit.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Bitfinex/Tether must prove Solvency - Refuse UDST/Bitfinex,"There is a large amount of community concern with the legitimacy of Tether and the connection to Bitfinex.  Most people have suggested launching investigations into the two, but lets be real, we are an unregulated community, so no authority is going to investigate in the near future.

The Solution:

The community as a whole has to demand that Tether and Bitfinex prove Solvency of both the exchange and the coin.  We need to refuse to transact in USDT and refuse to transact on Bitfinex.  What this means is take all of your trading to another exchange, and get rid of all of your Tether (I understand that in order to get rid of Tether someone else has to buy it, but I would recommend not being the one buying/holding it).  

If we want this company to prove legitimacy and solvency we must STOP USING THEIR PRODUCTS.  The crypto community has enough troubles between Bitconnect/Scam ICOs/the Public Media with proving the legitimacy of crypto that we don't need true fraud occurring on one of our biggest exchanges.  Yes if we prove that Tether/Bitfinex have been printing USDT without USD backing it will hurt the community in the short term, but it will ultimately prevent a bigger disaster in the future.  And if they are able to prove solvency/legitmacy it will reduce skepticism, which we all know, we don't need any more of that.  ",724,2017-11-19 19:25:53,353
USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether has just silently invested a part of their record-profits into BTC. They now hold $1.5b worth of BTC after just one quarter and are stillmaking $6B profits per year.,"Recently we have got the quarterly report by Tether, which was also made by an independent auditor, giving it more reliability as Tether itself is not exactly that well trusted. In just one quarter they had reported $1,5B in profits, making them most profitably per-employee company worldwide. That tally was also not too far off from some of the biggest banks profits, with tens of thousands of more employees.

But the profits are nothing interesting to us, but instead it is their new balance sheet…

Here we can see a new entry which is Bitcoin, at over $1.5B. That is over 52k BTC, more than the 40k the US government is intending to sell over the whole year.

We can also expect a high percentage of that being bought this year as the last quarterly report did not include any “Bitcoin“, possibly all $1.5B were acquired just this quarter. That is nearly half of all MicroStrategy buys.

It is even more funnier as Tether is buying that BTC from their profits and they are getting their profits through interest earnings from the US Treasury, which has been going up due to the FED raising interest rates. So basically the FED has made it possible and financed for Tether to buy more Bitcoin.",186,2023-05-16 20:10:03,225

USDT,cryptocurrency,The US Senate has NOT just requested information about Tether‘s backing by Dec 3rd,"A post on the hot page claims that the US Senate has requested information about Tether‘s backing by Dec 3rd. 
This is, at the very least, misleading and likely to induce FUD. 

Actual story: 

The ~~US Senate~~ a single member of the Senate, Sherrod Brown, sent ~~a letter to Tether~~ letters to all major stable coin issuers requesting ~~specific information about their backing~~ general information about each coins functionality. Mostly questions about the process of minting and redemption and its stability. 
Further, it isn’t clear if the letter to Tether has even been sent yet. 

So if there’s actually a crackdown on USDT incoming, it’s a long way down the road from here. The wheels of justice churn slowly and this is nothing but an initial request to understand how stablecoins work in comparison to banks. 

Please do your own research, this took 2min of Googling. 

This is the letter (copy pasted because I can’t put images in my posts): 


I write to request information regarding the Tether stablecoin. As documented in the recent report (Report) by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (the PWG), stablecoins present investor protection risks and raise several market integrity concerns. Consumers’ increased use of stablecoins, and their importance in effecting transactions in digital assets, underscores the need for greater understanding of the basic operation, and limitations, of Tether.
As the PWG noted, the market capitalization of stablecoins issued by the largest stablecoin issuers exceeded $127 billion as of October 2021, reflecting an almost 500 percent increase over the prior year. The complex terms and conditions applicable to digital assets and stablecoins, as well as the need for reliable and resilient underlying networks, can make it difficult for investors and consumers to fully understand the details of how those assets function and their potential risks. I have significant concerns with the non-standardized terms applicable to redemption of particular stablecoins, how those terms differ from traditional assets, and how those terms may not be consistent across digital asset trading platforms.
Even though stablecoins are typically “minted” in exchange for U.S. dollars, or other conventional currency, the purchase of stablecoins through a trading platform may not provide customers with the same rights and entitlements as a direct purchase from an issuer. In addition, customers may have different rights based on the amount of stablecoins owned or transacted. Furthermore, because the term stablecoin is used broadly, users may not appreciate the complexity and distinct features and terms of each stablecoin.
Accordingly, given the importance of the specifics related to the use of Tether to investors and consumers, please respond to the questions below in clear, straightforward terms. I understand that any response would not affect or change the binding terms or conditions applicable to any particular customer or circumstance, but your ability to provide information that can clarify the basic operational features of Tether is critical to improve the understanding of digital assets.

**1. Please describe the basic purchase, exchange, or minting process[es] by which customers can acquire Tether for U.S. dollars. In your answer, explain any relevant limitations or qualifications to engaging in and completing that process.**

**2. Please detail the process to redeem Tether and receive U.S. dollars. Here, also, identify any requirements or limits, including any minimum redemption size, waiting period, or qualifications.**

**3. Since Tether’s inception, how many Tether tokens have been issued, and how many have been redeemed? Over the last 12 months, what is the greatest percentage of the Tether in circulation at the beginning of a calendar week to be redeemed in the subsequent seven days?**

**4. Briefly characterize the market or operational conditions that would prevent the purchase, or redemption, of Tether for U.S. dollars, or another digital asset. For purposes of answering this question, do not list or describe legal or regulatory limitations currently described in a user agreement or terms of service. For each condition identified, please provide at least one example that occurred in the past 12 months and its duration.**

**5. Please identify any trading platforms that have enhanced capabilities, privileges, or special arrangements with respect to Tether, identifying those features and their basis (e.g., contractual or common control).**

**6. Please summarize any internal reviews or studies your company has conducted about how specific levels of redemptions would affect Tether, including its convertibility into U.S. dollars, or would affect the financial position of your company.** 

Please respond to the above by December 3. I appreciate your attention to this matter, and thank you for your timely cooperation.

Sincerely,
Sherrod Brown Chairman

USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether is moving 1 billion more USDT coins from TRON to Ethereum blockchain,,798,2020-09-14 12:39:13,164
USDT,cryptocurrency,"PSA: Stuart Hoagner (Tether's lawyer) just basically confirmed that Tether is in fact holding Chinese Commercial Paper. Though denying it's Evergrande debt, with default looming and its systemic effects on the China money market, this this is a Lehman Brother's-level ""Gray Rhino"" event in crypto","In the last 24 hours, $56 Billion in USDT volume was traded. That is more than Bitcoin, ETH, and the next 3 largest coins combined. It is the glue holding the world of crypto exchanges together.

I'm sure most of you have seen the movie ""The Big Short"". For the simplified cliff notes refresher - Leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, huge batches of dog-shit mortgages at high risk of default were being bundled up into various securities and bonds, which were then bought and sold by financial institutions around the world. When the defaults started rolling in....bla bla bla....global financial system collapses. Any financial institution holding the dog shit went down (either ending in bankruptcy or government bailout). Cool, remember that.

So Tether FUD has been a meme since Tether was a thing...for good reason too. Since inception, the stablecoin has been caught up in a seemingly endless stream of shadiness and legal issues. A bunch of the OG Tether execs/funders charged with bank fraud, ties to other fraudulent crypto criminal activities, shady ties to Bitfinex, The NYAG suing Tether/Bitfinex and holding them liable for lying about reserves and hiding, the current DOJ investigation...etc etc

Around 2019, Tether low key changed the claim on its website from ""We are backed 1-to-1 with cash"", to ""we are backed by cash and cash equivalents"". Of course this was swept under the table quickly in wild wild west cryptoverse.

Since January 2020, Tether's market cap (and distributions) has exploded from just $4+ Billion to now over $62+ Billion. Supposedly all safely backed by some form of financial reserve.

After the NYAG situation, earlier this year Tether was forced to finally publicly disclose their reserve composition. Although they didn't reveal much, the Microsoft Word-quality pie chart they posted did confirm that in fact just a fraction of their holdings is actual cash...the vast majority being held in ""Commercial Paper.""

What's commercial paper? It's short-term (unsecured) debt issued by companies. They're typically used to raise money for short term funding needs like buying inventory, payroll, or pre-paying construction vendors….kind of like an ""IOU"" of the corporate world. It usually gets a rating, and is usually pretty safe...so long as the companies issuing it remain solvent.

As of the latest Attestation by their sketch accountant shows Tether holds just $6.2 Billion in cash, $30.8 Billion in commercial paper, the rest T-Bills and RRPs. [https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tether\_assuranceconsolidated\_reserves\_report\_2021-06-30.pdf](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tether_assuranceconsolidated_reserves_report_2021-06-30.pdf)  

With it now in the open that these coins are actually operating more like unregulated money market funds, over the last several months alone the SEC, CFTC, DOJ, congressional financial committees, and the US Treasury department all set their sights on cracking down on stablecoins.

Furthermore, since Commercial Paper is traded at a discount to Face Value, Tether can buy up dog shit junk bonds for pennys on the dollar, but report it as the full maturity amounts on their balance sheet. Great for their balance sheet…horrible if there’s a run on Tether redemptions. 

A lot of moonbois and Crypto maxis tried to shrug all of this off, saying ""STFU FUDbois, who cares? They have a fractional reserve, regular banks do the same shit.""

This is true, except traditional banks are not gambling most of it in dog shit debt (at least hopefully not to the degree they pre-2008). Money market funds are pretty transparent with what they're invested in. And overall like them or not traditional banks are FDIC insured, meaning your funds are actually ""safu"" in the event of a run. 

Problem with Tether is that to this day, they still refuse to disclose the makeup of their commercial paper. Furthermore, at Tether's size they would be one of the biggest investors in the entire commercial paper market. However major players in the US investment markets claim they've never even heard of them. https://www.ft.com/content/342966af-98dc-4b48-b997-38c00804270a

So this has all lead to speculation that maybe their paper is in fact Chinese paper. Why does this matter? 

Over the last 2 years, Chinese property developers have been issuing debt like crazy. So much so that the Chinese government has recently begun to significantly crack down on it, fearing a thread to their entire financial system. The biggest culprit is a company called Evergrande, who has run up a tab of over $300 Billion in debt, and is at risk of default any day. Trading of their bonds were halted last week. https://gulfnews.com/business/property/chinas-evergrandes-moment-of-truth-arrives-as-bond-payment-deadlines-loom-1.82361403

As Tether's huge influx of insurances coincided with the Chinese property development debt surge, many began to speculate that Tether's holdings could in fact be Evergrande debt. 

Pressure on Tether regarding their reserves continued to mount until finally several weeks ago they released an attestation containing the supposed ratings of their paper holdings. They basically said ""Don't worry, all of our paper is rated A2 and above.""

Exoneration? Not really. Remember that scene in the Big Short when Steve Carell's character was going to the bond rating agencies only to find out that it was all a big pay-to-play scheme. The agencies gave pretty much everybody a high rating regardless of actual risk. Well...its the same thing in China. https://thediplomat.com/2019/06/understanding-chinas-bond-ratings/ It's all pay to play, everyone is given a high ratings, and the ratings don't really mean shit.

Case in point, Evergrande's rating was AA up until just a few days ago. https://www.barrons.com/articles/evergrande-suspends-trading-of-onshore-corporate-bonds-after-downgrade-51631786843

Basically, Chinese commercial paper is the equivalent of mortgage backed securities circa 2007. 

As pressure continued to build, and with regulators circling them like hawks, last week Tether finally made a public statement claiming they do not hold any Evergrande debt. They said “Tether does not hold any commercial paper or other debt or securities issued by Evergrande and has never done so,” But, they never said it wasn't Chinese paper at all.

Then just yesterday, Stuart Hoagner, Tether's lawyer put out a tweet saying.  "" If the concern is Evergrande, see our earlier statement. If the concern is Chinese CP, as such, we have published the ratings on our portfolio...""

This is essentially lawyer speak for ""We do hold Chinese paper, but don't worry because it has super good ratings"". 

So Tether is pretty much confirmed at least some or all of its paper reserves is Chinese. And if that's true, a good portion of it is probably dog shit debt right now. It does not matter if the debt is Evergrande, if the worst case scenario happens, and Evergrande defaults, the effects will be systemic throughout Chinese capital markets. The entire Chinese market will seize up. 

This event would cause the value of Tether's reserve holdings to plummet with it. If that happens, either the coin becomes unbacked, or they're forced to suck liquidity out of the market (burning coins). This is catastrophic for USDT and for crypto in general.

If Tether goes down, USDC or any other stablecoin will not have nearly enough liquidity to bail it out.  This is the Lehman-brothers gray rhino event of the crypto world.

 This is not FUD, this is a real situation you should pay attention to.
 
**TL;DR** Tether's lawyer basically confirmed they're holding a Chinese commercial paper time bomb. If Evergrande goes down, so will Tether's holdings.",380,2021-09-19 17:17:02,258

USDT,cryptocurrency,Danielle Sestagalli (Wonderland) is connected to the Tether scam! All these projects could be big front for mafia/narco money laundering operations. Related persons have been arrested in the past,"Earlier today the shocking story broke that 0xSifu heading the treasury for Wonderland Time is the same co-founder Micheal Patryn, of the infamous QuadrigaX exchange that stole $150m worth users funds. His original name wasnt even Micheal, he is a convicted identity fraud. 

Since then, many more stories have emerged detailing the shady connections of these people and their past. 

[The story is turning out to be something a fiction writer could be proud of. ](https://preview.redd.it/dickgaq6a9e81.jpg?width=669&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6016cacc331f5faa9247fe64bed558bb8eee412)

Im trying to sum up what I can find here, but damn there is a ton of stories coming out every moment. A journalist **Nicola Borzi** has published most of these details, he is an investigative journalist with 30 years of experience.  

It seems another person 0xMerlin involved with these Dani projects is none other than Giancarlo Devasini, the notorious CFO behind Tether and Bitfinex.

[Giancarlo had his skype ID merlin in his signature, this is part of NYAG's investigation into Tether. ](https://preview.redd.it/az9wb6zw59e81.jpg?width=1694&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e58065b0bc933b217cdd8618424e53d50c8e54d7)

Now coming to Danielle's projects, one after the other have lost money for investors, crashed or gotten hacked. Popsicle Finance is another one of Dani's projects that got hacked, and users lost funds. Bitfinex was hacked as well, where users lost funds and it was discovered by NYAG that Tether and Bitfinex borrowed among one another to make up the loss of funds. Just recently, Wonderland imploded and people are still trying to put together what happened, but there are massive trails of insiders pumping and dumping various tokens openly on the blockchain. 

Wonder why all these projects related to this group keep getting hacked? 

Before his present shenanigans in DeFi, Danielle Sestagalli launched regular crypto company that tried to go the fundraising route. He launched a company known as Zulu Republic. 

Dani spoke about this company Zulu, a video can be found on Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYUtAWKLFfQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYUtAWKLFfQ)

He describes Zulu as an ""identity based blockchain"". Meanwhile, just today it came to light that his Wonderland treasurer OxSifu is none other than Micheal Patryn, who previously served time for identity fraud. **Is it a co-incidence that Daniele ran a ""identity blockchain"" company, but suddenly became friends with a former identity fraud convict and made him treasurer of his Defi protocol?** 

Lets look more into this company Zulu.. details of this company could be found here on the Swiss companies register: [https://www.wirtschaftsregister.ch/shab.cfm?firma=ZULU\_MOBILITY\_TECHNOLOGIES\_GmbH,\_Chiasso&datum=01.11.2016&key=2497526](https://www.wirtschaftsregister.ch/shab.cfm?firma=ZULU_MOBILITY_TECHNOLOGIES_GmbH,_Chiasso&datum=01.11.2016&key=2497526)

Currently, Tether sits at a market cap of *$68 billion* at spot #3 and USDC coin sits at *$55 billion* at spot #4.  So USDC coin is within roughly **$13 billion** away from unseating it!

With all the uncertainty and misery right now, the last thing we would need is a total Tether collapse, so it’s terrific to see USDC more widely utilized. Hopefully we can have a smooth fade away from Tether, rather than a “rip the bandaid” period that could be much more destructive to the crypto environment.

""Tether’s claims of being backed 1:1 are provably false:
Adding to the concern for the legitimacy of Tether, is that they have also previously claimed all the way up until 2018 that their reserves were subject to frequent professional audits. This is patently false. There had not been a single independent audit conducted on Tether’s reserves up until 2020, which was conducted by a less than legitimate agency housed in the Cayman Islands.""


""Now , because Tether is completely controlled by the same guys that run a massive crypto exchange it essentially means that this crew of questionable characters (which we’ll read more about in a second) can create new Tethers (which are always worth a dollar) out of thin air and funnel them directly onto their exchange, without any scrutiny or regulation from a third party.

They can then use said Tethers (worth US$1 each despite being oftentimes unbacked) to buy real cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. After purchasing actual cryptocurrency  —   they can use new holdings of real crypto to mint even more new Tethers. This creates an enormous amount of real cash out of absolutely nowhere.

In plain English ,  by controlling the supply of Tether, this gang of anti-Robin Hoods basically gained access to their own personal money printer. They can indefinitely print money and then use that fake money to buy real cryptocurrency. They then sell this cryptocurrency and use that money to back more of their Tethers…

Beginning to see how this could death spiral?

This may sound a lot like a conspiracy theory but there’s very good reason to believe that all of this is entirely true. Here’s why...""

USDT,cryptocurrency,"Does Tether printing cause the price of Bitcoin to surge, or does Tether printing respond to the price surge and demand? Simply looking at the chart can answer that question.","There's been a theory that the only reason Bitcoin price goes up is because of Tether printing.

This theory has been debunked by actual statistical research at the University of California, Berkley.

[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=3508006](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3508006)

[https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/stable-coins-dont-inflate-crypto-markets](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/stable-coins-dont-inflate-crypto-markets)

But you don't need to do that much statistical research to see this for yourself. All you have to do is look at the chat.

When Tether prints, their market cap spikes up. Then all you have to is compare it to the price of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin price almost always foreruns Tether minting. The only exception is when Tether plays catch up, and may occasionally looks like it foreruns the price.

# The action this past month:

Here's  a look at what happened in the past month, as an example. Charts are showing the same timeline.

&#x200B;

**Part 1: the start of the rally:**

On the 7th, the bulls woke up, and started climbing the stairs:

&#x200B;

3 days later, Tether started to print in response:

&#x200B;

**Part 2, the last push before flat-lining again:**

Bitcoin continued to climb, and Tether continued to print, with about 2 days delay.

[Last price push starting on the 14th before flattening.](https://preview.redd.it/207ivfwejqmc1.jpg?width=958&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0045603becb697a0523f20534c75073ef629080b)

&#x200B;

**Part 3, Bulls waking up again on the 26th, and Tether pushing big minting in a couple of phases:**

Bitcoin starts a big rally on the morning of the 26th, after flat action.

[Bitcoin rally, starting at around 10 am on the 26th. ](https://preview.redd.it/no90rzutjqmc1.jpg?width=955&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52b96f1c68d9f7d34be6c5748fe3946034234d13)

More than 6 hours later, Tether starts to mint in bigger chunks.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Sometimes Tether prints, and Bitcoin dips behind it, as we've seen yesterday:**

If Tether is supposed to cause Bitcoin price rise, why is Tether minting sometimes followed by dips in price:

There is no transparency and they could crash the market. They can’t be trusted basically and there are other stable coins so why stick with Tether? And if no decent alternative exists why hasn’t one been made?

 They still haven’t been audited as far as I know which should be a massive red flag cos we just have to take their words for it that the money is all there on the exchange. 

 They also have people working for them with nefarious backgrounds, so why are they being trusted? They could be printing money for all we know and if they crash the market and everyone was to lose their crypto it would be a disaster. It could easily be avoided too but the longer this goes on the more I worry about it.

USDT,cryptocurrency,We've gotta talk about Republicans and crypto,"Tl;dr: Don't vote based on your bags. Republicans aren't the crypto boosters everyone makes them out to be, and the way Trump has used crypto as a grift to make money just reinforces existing stereotypes about crypto being scammy.

I know, I know. We're all saturated with politics and election crap right now and we're tired of it. Me too. But I hear the idea that ""Republicans are the pro-crypto party"" all the time and it's just not true.

https://preview.redd.it/e9aor4poqyyd1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9d39dea07e453748665ef5d8328094120fbb031

First, Republicans aren't uniformly supportive of crypto and Democrats aren't uniformly against it. My no-talent ass clown of a Senator (Roger Marshall) is a hardcore MAGA Republican but wildly anti-crypto. He called crypto a [""threat to our national security""](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-marshall-cryptocurrency-is-a-threat-to-our-national-security/) and co-sponsored a bill with Elizabeth Warren to make stricter AML/KYC regulations. During the FTX debacle he even suggested that the SEC [shut down all crypto transactions in the US](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/02/2022/roger-marshall-kansas). Saying that Democrats aren't supportive of crypto isn't true either. When you look at the list of [congressional candidates endorsed by Stand With Crypto](https://www.standwithcrypto.org/races/endorsed), half of them (19/39) are Democrats. Not to mention that Democrats incorporated some crypto-supportive events into the [DNC convention](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/09/24/how-democrats-have-shifted-on-crypto/) and [Anthony Scaramucci has reportedly been working with Kamala Harris](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/20/anthony-scaramucci-kamala-harris-campaigns-digital-asset-policies-.html) to develop pro-crypto policies. Saying Republicans are the more crypto-supportive party may have been true 5 years ago, but that has changed.

Secondly, we've got to talk about Trump. Saying that Trump is pro-crypto is like saying a bank robber is pro-unmarked bills. [His recent ""pro-crypto"" turn](https://www.axios.com/2024/05/30/trump-crypto-bitcoin-nfts) is at best a flip-flop and at worst a grift. In 2019 he said that [Bitcoin was ""based on thin air""](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192?lang=en) and as recently as [December of 2021](https://decrypt.co/89108/donald-trump-calls-crypto-dangerous-even-as-melania-launches-nft), he called crypto ""dangerous"" and a ""scam."" ([And he would know!](https://apnews.com/article/17e975d3ccba4a92a9b023dff8437b21)) But recently crypto has been very kind to him. [One of his wallets](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/donald-trump) has almost $6 million in it.

Not to be too much of a conspiracy theorist, but It ***really seems like*** after Melania Trump made an [unspecified (large) amount of money on a bunch of NFT projects in 2021 and 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/melanias-latest-nft-is-selling-for-180000-at-last-one-of-the-trumps-is-showing-entrepreneurial-spirit), Donald [suddenly changed his tune on crypto and started issuing a bunch of NFTs](https://decrypt.co/249755/trump-credits-nfts-change-of-heart-bitcoin-crypto) himself. When the NFT market dried up, he pivoted and was [collecting 2% of every transaction on shitcoins called things like ""Trump Bucks"" and ""Save America""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-donald-trump-made-nft-213019678.html) netting him at least a half million dollars. And of course don't forget about his newest ~~scam~~ DeFi project World Liberty Financial, [where 75% of all protocol revenue goes to the Trump family](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1g69fob/trump_family_gets_75_of_crypto_coin_revenue_has/) (who also has no liability) and who [couldn't keep their own website running](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/15/trump-familys-world-liberty-finance-token-sale-appears-to-go-live-selling-220m-wlfi-in-minutes/) during the rollout even though there wasn't much interest in the project.

I'm sure it's clear how I feel about him, and if you want to vote for him, be my guest. But don't do it because you think he's ""pro-crypto"" and will pump your bags if he's elected.

It seems pretty clear that he has no idea what crypto is or how it works. He [can't work a crypto wallet well enough to buy a burger with it](https://youtube.com/shorts/HIv4cwkz16U?si=2zjUCdPTnYVN9l_q), tweeted that he'll make sure Bitcoin is ""[made in the USA](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1852033244729860397)"" and stumbled through a [recent interview](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/donald-trump-struggles-and-seems-confused-in-painful-crypto-interview-while-trying-to-change-topic/ar-AA1qGv5X), saying:

>""It's so important. It's crypto. It's AI. It's so many other things. AI needs tremendous electricity capabilities beyond anything I ever heard.""

At the very best, he doesn't give a shit and will forget about and ignore it once it stops making him money, which effectively gives other countries the ability to set crypto regulation and reinforces the stereotype that crypto is super scammy. This point has been made over and over, but if we want the industry to grow sustainably for the long-term, [we need clear, effective regulation](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/22/tether-ceo-ardoino-says-he-expects-us-will-catch-up-in-crypto-regulation/), not benign neglect.

USDT,cryptocurrency,More Hedge Funds Are Betting Against Tether as Crypto Melts Down [WSJ],"Short sell­ers have been ramp­ing up their bets against tether, the world’s largest sta­ble­coin, amid a broad mar­ket sell­off that has called into doubt the fi­nan­cial health of some crypto com­pa­nies.

In the past month, more tra­di­tional hedge funds have ex­e­cuted trades to short tether through Gen­e­sis Global Trad­ing Inc., one of the largest crypto bro­ker­ages for pro­fes­sional in­vestors. These trades are worth “hun­dreds of mil­lions” of dollars in no­tional value, said Leon Mar­shall, Gen­e­sis’s head of in­sti­tu­tional sales. He de­clined to be more spe­cific.

“There has been a real spike in the in­ter­est from tra­di­tional hedge funds who are tak­ing a look at tether and look­ing to short it,” Mr. Mar­shall said in an interview.

Tether is a sta­ble­coin, which are vir­tual cur­ren­cies that are sup­posed to be pegged to the dol­lar or other na­tional cur­ren­cies, and it is the most widely traded in the world. Teth­er’s mar­ket cap stood at about $67 bil­lion on Fri­day, according to Coin­Mar­ket­Cap data.

Gen­e­sis, which doesn’t take a view on tether, said the short trades are al­most exclusively put on by tra­di­tional hedge funds in the U.S. and Eu­rope, while crypto firms—es­pe­cially those based in Asia—have been happy to fa­cil­i­tate the other side of the trans­ac­tions.

A num­ber of in­vestors have been bet­ting against tether for at least 12 months. But more hedge funds got in­ter­ested in short­ing tether af­ter the col­lapse in May of an­other sta­ble­coin, Ter­ra­USD, ac­cord­ing to Gen­e­sis.

Ter­ra­USD is a so-called al­go­rith­mic sta­ble­coin, which means it doesn’t have to be backed by real as­sets. Other more tra­di­tional sta­ble­coins, in­clud­ing tether, say they hold $1 of cash, Trea­sury bills or other tra­di­tional fi­nan­cial as­sets for each unit of sta­ble­coin.

Tether briefly lost its peg dur­ing the Ter­ra­USD col­lapse in May. It traded as low as 95 cents on May 12, re­flect­ing in­vestors’ con­cerns about the value of its assets and whether they would be read­ily con­vert­ible to cash in a mar­ket panic. It has since re­cov­ered and is now close to $1.

There are two main fac­tors dri­ving hedge funds to short tether, Mr. Mar­shall said, cit­ing con­ver­sa­tions that he has had with clients.

Some hedge funds are short­ing tether as a bet about the broader econ­omy. The Fed­eral Re­serve is rais­ing in­ter­est rates to curb 40-year-high in­fla­tion, scar­ing investors away from riskier as­sets in­clud­ing cryp­tocur­ren­cies.

Other hedge funds are con­cerned about the qual­ity of the as­sets back­ing tether. Tether says it main­tains an equiv­a­lent amount of re­serves that in­clude com­mer­cial pa­per—or cor­po­rate short term loans—bank de­posits, pre­cious met­als, gov­ern­ment bonds and digi­tal to­kens.

Tether has faced in­tense reg­u­la­tory pres­sure over its re­serves. Tether and re­lated en­ti­ties reached an $18.5 mil­lion set­tle­ment in 2021 with the New York at­tor­ney gen­er­al’s of­fice, which ac­cused them of mak­ing sev­eral pub­lic mis­rep­re­senta­tions re­gard­ing the dol­lar re­serves back­ing tether. They didn’t ad­mit or deny the al­le­ga­tions.

Some short sell­ers say they be­lieve that most of teth­er’s com­mer­cial-pa­per holdings are backed by debt-rid­den Chi­nese prop­erty de­vel­op­ers, The Wall Street Jour­nal pre­vi­ously re­ported. Tether said in a blog post this month that “these rumors are com­pletely false.” The com­pany added that it has been re­duc­ing its port­fo­lio of com­mer­cial pa­per.

A tether spokes­woman said the firm wouldn’t com­ment fur­ther on “how hedge funds are look­ing to gen­er­ate re­turns by cre­at­ing ar­bi­trage op­por­tu­ni­ties on the ba­sis of these ru­mors.”

Teth­er’s mar­ket cap has been de­clin­ing since it briefly lost its $1 peg. It is down about $16 bil­lion since a peak on May 5, ac­cord­ing to Coin­Mar­ket­Cap data.

USDT,cryptocurrency,What would happen if the US decides to go after Tether (USDT)?,"Tether, with their largest asset class being USDT, is in my humble opinion, a very likely target for the SEC.

The SEC is going after securities. A security, by definition, is: ""**a certificate or other financial instrument that has monetary value and can be traded"".**

I believe that USDT would fall under this category perfectly, considering it is a Stablecoins. Other Stablecoins have already been referenced as securities by the SEC.

&#x200B;

What would happen if USDT is attacked:

* A crypto crash. With a market cap of over 83 BILLION USD, an attack on Tether could spell doom on the entire crypto industry
* USDT would likely de-peg due to a large selling volume
* We would probably shift to more algorithmic Stablecoins (UST flashbacks), as they are not controlled by a central entity

&#x200B;

Why this might actually be likely:

* The SEC has proven itself to not be scared of going against large crypto organization
* Other Stablecoins have been referenced as securities
* USDT is the largest one, so might be used to set as an example
* The disruption of attacking USDT could be enough of an effect to satisfy the SEC

USDT,cryptocurrency,When Tether flips Ethereum by m/cap will that be the point the majority of the crypto community finally calls it out? ,"Tether is fast approaching a market cap of $120 billion after adding $115 billion since just over four years ago in March 2020. This is despite the fact that 5 years after it launched it was still just a little over $4 billion. It's currently now sitting the third largest crypto by market cap in the world according to CMC, ranking ahead of every other crypto in the world by market cap apart from Ethereum and Bitcoin. 

Over the years many critics including those in the crypto community have suggested it's vastly manipulated.

From 2014 to 2017, Tether didn't publish reports on reserves however after 2022, Tether has published quarterly attestations. Attestation are different from an audit. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices where with an attestation Tether provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm’s financial review. In addition Tether have also admitted that the big four audit firms won't touch them. 

All Tether needs to do is have a proper/ full financial audit by a major name to silence the cynics and critics... yet they can't do it.

[Tether Reserves May 2022](https://preview.redd.it/0pl1504ga0091.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b2c9344bbccc3d278c37339eaa21d35f6863d1b)

These numbers are from the last report which is from 31 Dec, 2021. They were supposed to publish another report on 31 Mar, 2022 which they didn't and the reason is because they aren't fully backed. You of course wouldn't want others to know that you don't have 100% of the backing. Even if they don't say, we can make an approximate calculation based on that few month old report. Let's do that.

""*Other investments*"" is a fancy way of saying cryptocurrencies. With the recent dump, the most pessimistic outlook would be that they have lost 50-70% or so of that 6.38% in ""*Other investments*"". That would mean they have about 3%\~ish in it. Assuming all other figures are accurate, Tether would then have a **reserve of 96.62%**. And the optimistic view would be a loss of like 30% which would mean a total reserve of **about 98%\~**.

Now, let's account for all the other stuff. *Secured Loans* are generally liquid. *Bonds and Metals* I believe are also covered. They might have made some more with the rise of gold prices. xD

In the *Cash & Cash Equivalents* section, T-Bills and Bank Deposits are secured (best cash assets). The *Money Market Funds* is also a small portion hence I will take that at face value. The biggest issue is the 36.68% in this section which is 30.715% of the total reserve. Here's its breakdown:

https://preview.redd.it/25ijzmeha0091.png?width=819&format=png&auto=webp&s=cddcb53ca9f1443f5a9dc8b2bd7c5a8147953cae

Tether has 11bn for both A1 and A2 graded papers. These are generally good and A1 graded papers almost never default. A2 and A3 are not that bad either. The Other graded ones are junk bonds. I wonder why the auditors didn't say what they are. Maybe that fat check they received had some conditions? So, that's 300m of trash which is like **0.5%** of total reserves. Even if we pessimistically assume that these are defaulted bonds, it wouldn't have much impact.

So my most pessimistic outlook for Tether is that it is **96% backed and most optimistic is 98%**. So, yes it is true that **Tether is not fully backed right now**, and it is probably between 96-98% backed. But that doesn't mean it is going to implode and go to zero like Luna.

Ok, but you might say that they are just lying about these numbers in the report published on 31 Dec, 2021. No, they are not lying and CFTC has verified that Tether has had fully backed reserves for 27% of days for 2 years and they are under active surveillance by the US authorities and CFTC.

[CFTC Orders Tether and Bitfinex to Pay Fines Totaling $42.5 Million](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21):

>As found in the order, Tether held sufficient fiat reserves in its accounts to back USDT tether tokens in circulation for only **27.6% of the days in a 26-month sample time period from 2016 through 2018**.  
>  
>The order also finds that, instead of holding all USDT token reserves in U.S. dollars as represented, Tether relied upon unregulated entities and certain third-parties to hold funds comprising the reserves; coming led reserve funds with Bitfinex’s operational and customer funds;  
>  
>and held reserves in non-fiat financial products. The order further finds that Tether and Bitfinex’s combined assets included funds held by third-parties, including at least 29 arrangements that were not documented through any agreement or contract, and that Tether transferred Tether reserve funds to Bitfinex, including when Bitfinex needed help responding to a “liquidity crisis.”

What the above statement means is that the total reserve was oscillating below or above 100%. The fact that Tether was fined is a good thing. It verified how legit tether is and pushes them to stay legit.

**The above context assumes a normal market environment. But won't it just go to zero in a bank run (a very fast one) causing a massive Bitcoin crash?**

Lol, yes but no. If people want to sell 84bn, that money would have to go somewhere. And while most of it might be redeemed, a major portion would require a safe haven which will be Bitcoin. So, in the beginning BTC might crash 30% but it will go up 200% or more if a bank run within say a few days were to happen. And **94% of tether backing is in traditional assets**.

The traditional markets will definitely feel the pain as tether will be forced to sell 75 or so billion in trad assets which could cause a crisis in the traditional markets. The funny thing is, this is the reason why CFTC went after Tether. Its main job is to protect its wall street masters.

The crazy thing is, tether skeptics have repeatedly been proven right on the facts. The initially-denied bitfinex/tether relationship was revealed in the paradise papers. The fact that it was not 1:1 cash backed was confirmed by the NYAG investigation.

*  Tether and Bitfinex CEO J. L. van der Velve used to sell a product he claimed could transform the nicotine in cigarettes into vitamins - and suggested it allowed you to smoke 300 per day.

* Their chief council, Stuart Hoegner, once held all of the Tether backing reserves in his personal Bank of Montreal account co-mingled with his lunch money, one assumes. He was also director of compliance at Excapsa, parent company of Ultimate Bet, where they had a backdoor interface allowing their friends to see their opponents cards. 

* Giancarlo Devasini , their CFO, is a former plastic surgeon (for about a week) who had to pay a $65,000 fine for pirating Microsoft software in 1996 and was then sued by Toshiba for infringing some of their DVD patents. 

*  Tether was co-founded by former Mighty Ducks cast member Brock Pierce, the guy who fled to Spain with Mark Collins-Rector while he was an indicted fugitive on child sex trafficking charges. They were then both arrested in a villa full of child pornography.

* None of the leadership team wanted to admit they were involved in Tether until it came out in the paradise papers because they used Appleby. Because of course they used Appleby. 

* The guy who runs their banking partner, Deltec and Moonstone , was the creator of Inspector Gadget - Jean Chalopin. 



The scamminess of Tether is pretty much obvious to everyone in the crypto world at this point .I believe the explanation might be that Tether fills an absolutely essential role in providing liquidity to Crypto markets.
So fundamental that everyone allows it to continue to operate in spite of knowing how rotten to the core the whole thing is.",90,2023-02-03 14:48:15,179

USDT,cryptocurrency,The most important piece of regulation on cryptocurrencies in the world thus far has arrived: I read through all 405 pages of the “Proposal for EU Regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets” so you don’t have to. Here are my conclusions.,"# I present to you, the most important regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies so far: ""Proposal for a Regulation Of The European Parliament and of The Council on Markets in Crypto-assets, and amending Directive (EU) 2019/1937"".

(TL;DR BELOW)

**First of all, some context. This will be a long post but sometimes long posts are necessary. Bear with me.** 

The proposed Regulation, the most important one to date for the entire crypto industry, establishes rules for issuers/offerors of crypto-assets (also known as: the foundations, developers and companies behind coins/tokens) and crypto-asset service providers (also known as: exchanges and custodians).

These rules will have to be followed by every entity operating in the European Union. However, because of the “*Brussels Effect*”, there is a very good chance these rules will become international standards in the end. While everyone is focused on the US and China, the EU is casually leading the way.

The Council of the European Union (all EU Ministers of Finance or Economics) has just given its permission to start negotiations with the European Parliament (basically: things just got real). If they both approve the proposed Regulation, it will become EU law. I expect the Regulation to be voted through relatively easily with only minor amendments. The final legal text to become official EU law will thus be *very similar* to the current proposal I will be discussing in this post.

The European Union emphasizes that they have an interest in “developing and promoting the uptake of transformative technologies in the financial sector, including distributed ledger technology (DLT)”. They state that this Regulation is meant to: “support innovation and fair competition, while ensuring a high level of protection of retail holders and market integrity in crypto-asset markets, enable crypto-asset service providers to scale up their business on a cross-border basis, and facilitate their access to banking services to run their activities smoothly"". The EU also says that they do not (!) intend to regulate the underlying technology of crypto-assets.

I will now discuss (1) the rules this Regulation sets out for issuers/offerors of different categories of crypto-assets and (2) the rules set out for exchanges operating in the European Union.

*Rules in this Regulation for Issuers/Offerors of Crypto-Assets*

**A) Crypto-assets that are unique and not fungible with other crypto-assets: no regulations**

NFTs, including digital art and collectibles are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation, even when these assets are traded in market places and when they have (high) speculative value.

**B)** **Utility Tokens: no regulations**

‘Utility token’ means a type of crypto-asset which is only intended to provide access to a good or a service supplied by the issuer of that token (EU definition). Utility tokens are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation, as long as the good or service exists or is in operation.

**C)** **Crypto-assets offered for free: no regulations**

Crypto-assets where the receiver does not give money, fees, personal data or commissions to the offerors/issuers in return for those crypto-assets, are not (!) bound to bound to the rules described in this Regulation. This may be good news for Moons (there is no active exchange of personal data in return for Moons; even when Reddit collects personal data from all users).

**D) Crypto-assets that are “automatically created as a reward for the maintenance of the DLT or the validation of transactions in the context of a consensus mechanism”: no regulations**

These crypto-assets are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation.

**E) E-Money (stablecoins): very strict regulations**

‘Electronic money token’ or ‘e-money token’ means a type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing to the value of an official currency of a country (EU definition). These tokens will be strictly regulated. Only recognized credit institutions and ‘electronic money institutions’ are allowed to issue e-money stablecoins. They will have to follow very strict rules (see Regulation Title IV for further details). Edit 1: As part of these strict rules, it seems that EU citizens would also not be able to earn interest on stablecoins, as pointed out by u/TheWerewolf5. Edit 2: it will take a while before this is all signed into law so exchanges still have a few years to phase out Tether for regulated stablecoins. There won't be a sudden Tether apocalypse. 

**F) Asset-Referenced Tokens (stablecoins): very strict regulations**

‘Asset-referenced token’ means a type of crypto-asset that is not an electronic money token and that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing to any other value or right or a combination thereof, including one or several official currencies of a country (EU definition). This is what Facebook/Meta tried to do with Libra. These tokens will be strictly regulated. Only recognized credit institutions and entities that have been granted permission by the authority of an EU Member State can issue asset-referenced stablecoins in the European Union. They will have to follow very strict rules (see Regulation Title III for further details).

**G)** **Crypto-assets that do not belong to any of the previously mentioned categories (e.g. payment coins that do not promise a stable value or tokens that cannot be seen as utility tokens): some regulations**

These crypto-assets face some regulation. The Regulation describes very detailed rules on the contents of white papers and also establishes rules on marketing communications. This is bad news for scams with poorly written, undetailed white papers and those using misleading forms of marketing. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will most likely establish templates and standards for white papers in the crypto-industry (see Regulation Title II for further details).

*Rules in this Regulation for Exchanges and Custodians*

**A) Exchanges / custodians (centralized): rather strict regulations**

The Regulation focuses on establishing strict rules, such as: the obligation to apply for official authorization in an EU Member States; the obligation to act in the best interest of clients; the obligation for capital requirements, safeguards and insurance policies; the obligation to follow organizational requirements; the obligation to protect the crypto-assets and funds of clients; the obligation to hold the crypto-assets of clients in separate accounts than the accounts belonging to the exchange; the obligation to maintain effective and transparent complaint handling procedures; the obligation to identify, disclose and prevent conflicts of interest; the obligation to have resilient trading systems with sufficient capacity to deal with peak order and message volumes; and much more (see Regulation Title V for further details).

There is, however, a small but concerning statement for privacy coins: “The operating rules of the trading platform for crypto-assets shall prevent the admission to trading of crypto-assets which have inbuilt anonymisation function unless the holders of the crypto-assets and their transaction history can be identified by the crypto-asset service providers that are authorised for the operation of a trading platform for crypto-assets”. What exactly they mean with this and which coins exactly fall under this category still remains to be seen. But I don't think this comes as a shock for many.

**B) Fully decentralized exchanges and DeFi: no regulations (yet)**

Fully decentralized exchanges and DeFi protocols are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation. Exchanges that are only partially decentralized may be bound to some of the rules in this Regulation but this is up for interpretation. The EU will, in the next few years, explore whether or not they will regulate this specific space.

**C)** **Self-custody software wallets / hardware wallets: no regulations**

These are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation. Remember the huge ""EU will ban anonymous wallets"" FUD a few months ago? It was all a lie. No rules!

*Overall assessment*

I am pleasantly surprised. While some of you want nothing to do with regulation, which I respect, this seems very reasonable and a step in the right direction. This text has clearly been written by highly knowledge civil servants and has been endorsed by EU Ministers of Finance with a more open approach to blockchain and cryptocurrencies than their non-EU counterparts. The EU made the mistake of allowing the US/Asia to dominate the tech industry. They do not want to repeat that mistake with the cryptocurrency space.

**TL;DR: Cryptocurrency will still be the 'Wild West of Finance'; but now there will be a new Sheriff in town. And that Sheriff, is the European Union. It does no longer tolerate unregulated stablecoins; it does no longer tolerate shady projects with no utility, crappy white papers, and misleading marketing; and it sure as hell does no longer tolerate unprofessional exchanges who screw EU citizens out of their money. But it does like innovation and it will try** ***not*** **to hinder development in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space because they have made similar mistakes before in other industries.**

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the FOUR YEAR REPORT for the 2018 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, NEM, DASH, IOTA,** and **Stellar.**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting every single month for four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and more recently, the [2022 Top Ten a few weeks ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/). ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.
* **December** **Highlights:** A bloody, all-red month
* **Overall since Jan. 2018:** **ETH** solidly in the lead, followed by **BTC** and **ADA.**  After briefly pulling ahead earlier in the year, ***the 2018 Top Ten are now significantly underperforming the S&P 500*** over the same time period.  Q: So, big crypto fail, right?
* A: Only if I stopped after the first year.  The **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 406%, much, much better than traditional markets over the same time period (**fancy new chart at the very bottom of the post).

***Some exciting new changes for*** [2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!***

1. I'll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis (down to two reports per month)
2. Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time. 
3. Factoring in stablecoin gains:  In past years, I have not included the ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports.  This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).
4. Giveaways: Who doesn’t love a good old fashioned giveaway? I’ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I’m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.
5. Friendly competition: I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP r/TotalCryptoMarketCap) to see which one outperforms.

And here we go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Four Year Report – UP 34%

https://preview.redd.it/c3c6wlctpgb81.jpg?width=1056&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=380248b14486edaa5749fba7a390198bf81260a0

Welcome to the four year report!

The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, IOTA, NEM, Dash,** and **Stellar**.  

December highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **100% red month**. **IOTA** falls the least, only down -4% (on news that staking on the Firefly wallet will yield two cryptos, Assembly and Shimmer).
* **ETH** maintains a solid overall lead, **BTC** in second place, **ADA** in third.  Three coins in the green since January 2018.
* After four years, the 2018 Portfolio is +34%, behind the S&P 500’s ROI over the same time period.

## December Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in ranks since January 2018:

https://preview.redd.it/ulc9dwgvpgb81.jpg?width=412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2eadc9a98ec75b726cef37af7cb716fddf3126db

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:** After four years of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have remained.  **NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA**, and **Litecoin** have been replaced by **Binance Coin, Tether**, **DOT, SOL**, **LUNA**, and **USDC.  NEM** looks like it wants to be the first to drop out of the Top 100.

## December Winners and Losers

***December Winners*** –  **IOTA** outperformed the pack, dropping only -4% this month. 100% of the cryptos in the red.

***December Losers*** –   Losing nearly a third of its value, **Litecoin** fell the most, down -30%. **NEM** followed **LTC**, dropping -27% in December.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After four years, here’s a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment. 

https://preview.redd.it/lisz7rgxpgb81.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbf41f94e9716f0140f3a7dfff3f655fa9d21a59

With 11, **Bitcoin** has two more monthly wins than second place **Cardano**.  **NEM** has finished last place most often (12 months out of 48).

**Bitcoin** is still the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).

## Overall Update –  2021 ends with a whimper. After four years, ETH in first place, and Dash and NEM tied for worst overall performance.

After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in [October](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46), the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio continued to lose value.  After four years of holding these cryptos, only 3 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green: **BTC,** **ETH,** and **ADA.**

Overall, first place **ETH** (+413%) is well ahead of **BTC** (+257%) and third place **ADA** (+99%).

The initial $100 invested in first place **ETH** four years ago?  It’s worth $515 today.

**DASH** and **NEM** are virtually tied at the bottom, both down over -86% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.**  The initial $100 invested in each four ago is worth about $13 today.  

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/mldnsr7zpgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=d82435bc0e39657707f2143fb5dd1951f6ddcfd1

End of December 2021 market cap: **$2,211,626,655,207**

The total crypto market dropped significantly in December.  Crypto as a sector is still up +285% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+34%), the return of the S&P (+78%) over the same period of time, and nine of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for **Ethereum)**.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.65T in** [**October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/)**.**

## Bitcoin dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/qygnx0a0qgb81.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=567958cf7214839fa7befa749d61125dade6a9a8

**BitDom** declined a bit in December, ending the month at 40.2%.  When looking at the entire four year 2018 Experiment time frame, **BTC** dominance is near the low end.  For context:   

Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**33% in January 2018**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one).

High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: 

https://preview.redd.it/cxtd9lb1qgb81.jpg?width=339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25b3da0034194812e2b66f977450fff1555b48fb

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost $325 in December.

If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, **the $1000 initial investment would be worth $1,341**, up 34% from [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

Green is unfamiliar territory for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio and a recent development.  Over the first four years of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only ten months of green.  And all ten of the green months have come in 2021. 

Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment four years ago:

https://preview.redd.it/cbumx113qgb81.jpg?width=654&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bba9861143359ff6b70ff0ca8e6ba75de5d00d6

The all time high for this portfolio is [October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46) (+72%).  The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down [\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).   

Remember: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.  The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.

But I didn’t stop the Experiment in 2018:  I invested another $1000 in the ***2019***, ***2020,*** and ***2021*** Top Ten Cryptos as well (***(and, just announced,*** [***again in 2022***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!)***.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?    

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48): up +34% (total value $1,341)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36) up +504% (total value $6,044)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24): up +795% (total value $8,951)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +292% (total value $3,921)

So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,257** ($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).

**That’s up +406%** on the combined portfolios, **down from** [**last month’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47) for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

***That’s a +406% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four years in a row.***

## Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  

https://preview.redd.it/3uss07c8qgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e68ae4c88a82ff35b70538ec11dd137e83447e2

After four years: the S&P 500 is up +78% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) would be worth $1,780 had it been redirected to the S&P.  That’s more than double the +34% return of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio over the same period of time.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,430** ($1,780 + $1,900 + $1,480 + $1,270)

That is up **+61%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+406%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

Here’s a fancy new chart showing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for monthly progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects where I repeat the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of new sets of Top Ten cryptos as of [January 1st, 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36), [January 1st, 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24), [January 1st, 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12), and most recently, [January 1st, 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/).",6950,2022-01-13 14:11:48,1510
USDT,cryptocurrency,"For the newcomers: the top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence.","I tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
15. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
17. **Bitcoin SV (BSV)\*:** Bitcoin Scam Variant
18. **EOS (EOS):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
19. **Elrond (EGLD):** Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR)\*:** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
37. **SushiSwap (SUSHI):** a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
38. **Binance USD (BUSD):** Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.
39. **FTX Token (FTT):** It’s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.
40. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the token of Crypto.com public blockchain, that tries to enable transaction worldwide between people and businesses.

42. **UMA (UMA):** it builds open-source infrastructure in order to create synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain
43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",14809,2021-02-09 12:03:25,1588

*I’m bullish given all what I said in terms of geopolitical uncertainty…*

*I’m bullish on Bitcoin. I think that it can easily retest the all-time high levels around $60,000+.*

*Bitcoin is in this moment, I think, decoupling from the traditional financial markets. I think that given the geopolitical situation we are in, the banking industry situation we are in, I think people are getting scared.*

*So when there are bank runs around the world, I think, Bitcoin is the only asset that you can really hold for yourself, you can hold in your hardware wallet.*

*And it’s a hedge against everything that could happen, or already happened in the past months and could happen in the future.*

*I know that there is a bet on Bitcoin that it could reach $1 million in 90 days. I’m kind of skeptical about that because honestly, I wouldn’t even hope for that.*

*Because if Bitcoin would reach such a high price level, it would mean that the entire economy will crumble. And I’m not sure it is the word that we want to live in.*",84,2023-03-25 08:17:25,147

USDT,cryptocurrency,The Tether Fraud - looking for the other side,"So i've read a couple of articles recently about this whole Tether situation (most recent being this: [https://crypto-anonymous-2021.medium.com/the-bit-short-inside-cryptos-doomsday-machine-f8dcf78a64d3](https://crypto-anonymous-2021.medium.com/the-bit-short-inside-cryptos-doomsday-machine-f8dcf78a64d3)) and i'm not sure what to think.

It sounds pretty serious and when I search around I can't find much to debunk it. I do see a lot of comments like ""this is just tether FUD, ignore it, newbies don't listen"", but what I don't see is constructive discussion about why this shouldn't be something scary for the community.

Ultimately what i'm looking for is an indication that I shouldn't be concerned for the price of bitcoin to tank once Tether are forced to be transparent with their documentation (the deadline is today) when it looks like they're running a pretty fraudy operation.

Why are more people not talking about this?",190,2021-01-15 13:50:46,246
USDT,cryptocurrency,Congratulations Lunatics. Do Kwon just gave regulators the opportunity they have been gagging for to come in and absolutely rail the crypto industry and exchanges.,"First off, the collapse of Luna caught the attention of regulators around the globe, especially in the USA. Stable coin regulation is coming and there is nothing anyone can do about it. I don’t actually think this is a bad thing to prevent future meltdowns (full audit of tether pls).

So what does this c#ck head do…….creates Luna 2.0. This is a regulators wet dream. The optics on this whole thing are so incredibly bad.

To ALL of the exchanges out there who listed this token……you fucked up. 

Not only do the regulators have hard on for flogs like Do Kwon, but you are in their crosshairs even more now. Exchanges literally listed the exit pump token for Do Kwon’s initial ponzi. Utterly psychotic. Like how can they be so stupid.

Exchanges should have denied the listing of Luna 2.0. 

This is why we are so far away from full scale adoption. It’s bullshit like this and maybe it’s time for the regs to come in and clean this bullshit up. A lot of people lost a lot of money in the last couple of weeks, Do Kwon is causing more and more damage every day he is active in the crypto asset class.",5320,2022-05-29 10:12:46,1209
USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether is buying more Bitcoin to hold on their balance sheet. Isn’t that what Do Kwon did as a backstop for Terra USD?,"It seems like history is kind of repeating itself. The circumstances are different, but Tether is going to use 15% of their profits to buy Bitcoin to hold for an undetermined amount of time. This is after the purchase they have already made. Saw this news today on the Wall Street journal. 


Terra USD, Do Kwon did the same thing to have another potential backstop for his algorithmic stablecoin. 

Tether refuses to allow an audit and they are backed one to one with short term treasuries, etc. They are also buying before the bull run and IMO are getting a good deal on their Bitcoin purchase. 

My question is why do they feel that they should have Bitcoin in their reserves? Are they trying to be more like Microstrategy? It just seems weird to me that they would buy Bitcoin. I understand they are using profits, but why? Is it just to boost their profits?

***edit*** I appreciate the lively discussion. Let’s hope Tether is with us well into the future and we get clarity on reserves from all stablecoin issuers",15,2023-05-17 23:27:55,166
USDT,cryptocurrency,EXPLANATION: The recent crash was probably due to margin accounts having a cascading crash on Binance.,"Degenerates on Binance with up to 150x leverage (borrowing Tethers to buy crypto) have been building up their margin account balances to big numbers, and when they make money, they double down, and build even bigger positions. Because they're degenerates.

But when the price dips below a certain point, some degenerates who have these margin accounts are suddenly below their maintenance limits, and they get liquidated. When they get liquidated, Binance will sell your crypto for Tether, and you are left with little to nothing.

So what happened? Crypto got sold, and Tether got bought. Because Crypto got sold, the price drops, which triggers more accounts, who thought they were safe, to dip below their margin maintenance requirements.

This creates a feedback cycle which basically ends in the liquidation of all the margin accounts. It all ends in a very fast, cascading crash like we just saw.

The bad news is the price is lower, but there's a silver lining. The good news is the market is in a healthier position after this. Most of the unsustainable degenerate margin accounts are probably gone. If we go up to $60k in the next week, it's not because of borrowing (as much). Going forward, at least for the near term, another event like this is not very likely.

The price we see right now could be thought of as being closer to the ""real"" price which we would have had without the degenerates.

TLDR: Fuck Binance

And fuck the rest of the exchanges with 150x leverage bullshit

EDIT: Some people wanted more evidence to support this theory, so I suggest you look at the price differences between the exchanges (Binance vs. Coinbase, for instance) during the crash. You'll notice the exchange with leverage was significantly lower in price, which suggests bots were arbitraging Coinbase down to match it. Additionally, note the Tether price during the crash, which went up to $1.05.

USDT,cryptocurrency,"Binance Moved $2.7 Billion Out Of 'Proof Of Reserves' Wallet Less Than 24 Hours After Publishing Proof of Reserves, Additional Funds Also 'Missing'","Binance(through CZ) was the company that said that users should get their funds off exchanges. They claimed customer assets are fully backed on Binance.  They said you shouldn't trust (other) exchanges and championed proof of reserves. Then they published their proof of reserves *article* on 10th November at about UTC 13:00:00 or 1PM UTC (the actual snapshot taken earlier obviously) . But **only 20 hours** after publishing, Binance moved 2.7 Billion USDT to another wallet. This wallet is not disclosed or tagged as a Binance wallet and not present in their ""Proof of Reserves"" publishing. 

&#x200B;

[Transfer Out of 'Proof of Reserves' Wallet](https://preview.redd.it/dd1yvaxnzi0a1.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c7c5d1a8cb03b83dceecd45089068521dd1cc08)

Then **only just yesterday**, 200 Million tokens were transferred back into a disclosed Binance wallet leaving around 2.5 Billion Tether left in the new undisclosed strange wallet.

&#x200B;

There are also some additional funds missing from other wallets in their proof of reserves snapshot. The second Tron Binance wallet is missing around 2.4 Billion and the third is missing 500 Million(screenshots in Appendix). The bulk of these funds seem to have went missing on the 14th Nov.

. 

In the case of the second and third wallets, at least these funds *might* be explained by users actually withdrawing although this can be up for debate. Even then, there's no way to explain an exchange simple shifting billions in funds into some brand new undisclosed wallet in the case of the first wallet. And they did this **only 20 hours** after publishing their 'proof' of reserves snapshot. 

Sure, companies have the right to manage and store their funds in whatever way they like. They aren't bound to keep it in any particular wallet. But that begs the question, why not just disclose their new wallet with a simple addition to their published proof of reserves statement. Why not properly organize and manage their funds so that they wouldn't look shady making such transactions after  the fact(of publishing reserves). Why not even post something as basic as tweet to provide transparency to users in all of the chaos we are experiencing now as the CEO tweets about things of much less significance. They should know trust in the space is at an all time low.  But instead, users like me have to dig through tons of data to figure out something they could have easily disclosed. Shady as heck. Whether this is funny business they are engaged in or just management incompetence, either way it is not good at all.

USDT,cryptocurrency,"Tether is using a bank in Bahamas for USD transactions, not the US","Tether is famous for saying to the media “trust us, it’s good” and acknowledging that at one point in time, they were not fully backed by legitimate reserves (IOUs don’t count).

**Newest Tether Drama**

https://preview.redd.it/fo6faxtvg6lb1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a641c9ddb89bf07d4ac2168546ddd1a495f4ebc

It is now being reported that Tether is telling USD clients to use Britannia Bank & Trust, a private bank in the Bahamas to send USD transfers. This ""partnership"" has not been officially announced yet. The official USD partners are Deltec Bank and Capital Union Bank.

**Why and what does this mean**

I have no idea, but I find it strange that a ""giant company"" company like Tether could not find a US-based partner to handle USD transactions. Circle, the issuer of USDC, has no problem with using US-based banks.

Hopefully, this is just useless information that means nothing, but it is odd. Maybe if Tether upped their payroll to 40 employees they could have found a US banking partner.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Anyone else holding out on BTC due to what's going on with Tether?,"BTC will struggle to be a stable store of value until its association with shitcoins ends. Take Tether for example:

* Thether accounts for **60% of BTC transactions**
* Tether has been printing dollars out of thin air
* When Tether runs out of money the coin will lose the peg and all hell breaks loose
* There are rumours of people using offshore Tether exchanges to 10x leverage BTC speculation.

Bottom Line: Tether inflates BTC prices and has been this whole time. Tether has never shown it has the USD reserves to back its dollar peg and has printed billions of Tether ""dollars"". The people behind Tether are about as sketchy as it gets. When Tether goes, so will the BTC bottom. See also:

USDT,cryptocurrency,Here it is. The subs most despised coins combined into a single awful folio. This is the folio of hate. How much do you want it to fail? Does it make you angry?," Well after a long and exhaustive battle of coins being shilled in just a couple of hours, I have found the list of the subs most hated coins. There was definitely a lot of hate out there. I put $100 into each and stored it on a seperate group of wallets to my real bags. To make it easier to track, I create the folio of hate using coinmarketcap to track them more easily. I'll post the updates every month and hope to see some big gains going against us all (even my most hated coin is in this group).

There was a lot of hate from users, towards some coins more so than others. The two most hated were the most hated by a very long way. Merry Christmas everyone!

The final list in order of most votes and comments is listed in the comment below because the filter won't let me create a post with that many coin names in it. 

EDIT: Oh my God. You Loopers are the worst. For like the 50th time, the reason it was voted in is because of you and the constant shilling. Almost no one in the sub actually hates the coin.

USDT,cryptocurrency,I made a post about the scam OpisHub yesterday. The scammers didn't like that and bought downvotes to make my post invisible. So this is an even more detailed post about them.,"Yesterday I made [a post](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o6zy0e/scam_warning_if_you_see_posts_praising_opishub_on/) about OpisHub. It's still up, but the main point was that they approached me to shill their shitcoin for money and that they are really shady, it has many red flags and very much looks like a scam.

Then one of the scammers (Scammer 2) sent me a message that he didn't like it, and that I was deleting his comments on my post (lol he has less than 50 comment karma, they just got deleted, of course I didn't do anything). My post only had like 35 or 50 upvotes at this point and it had already been 2 hours since I posted, the post wouldn't have become very big - but the scammers decided to buy downvotes, bringing it to below 0 within minutes, [see also here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o75scd/the_scammers_behind_opishub_didnt_like_the_post_i/h2wxc7e/). The mods deleted a post about this that I made yesterday (because it broke another rule, so I understand - but that post is probably also the reason why my original post is above 0 again), so here I go again: these guys are obviously shady, some examples:

* one of them (the one that originally approached me, Scammer 1), [pretended to have just stumbled across the project](https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/) instead of saying that he was part of the project **EDIT:** just saw that the post was deleted, it's archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429143341/https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/)
* they wanted to pay me (and most likely others) to shill their project
* they [openly told me](https://imgur.com/a/rgw1HsB) they would do vote manipulation and upvote my posts about them and then, well, bought downvotes

So even if the coin would not be a total scam - which I really think it is - they are obviously doing shady stuff. I have already listed the obvious red flags that make them look like your average scam coin, here they are again, slightly adapted:

* they use your phone's CPU for mining
* the CPU is used to power scientific research (of course they don't say what ""scientific research"" they are talking about anywhere). And I work in science: of course I would rather use the CPU of a few phones than, well, the powerful computers we have, just as much as I would rather ride a few cats that are tied together than a horse
* ""each transaction gives a small % to charity""
* they plan to be super eco friendly and plant trees
* ""our primary promotional point is that it adds people's incentive to get  their friends and family on board , therefore we will have a reffer@l scheme in place"", so it's officially a pyramid scheme
* the token (and app) will launch soon ™

Scammer 1 had also told me they ""have received £3.5million pounds in the last week to utilise to get this project off the ground"". If you look at their social media activity etc., it's all extremely basic and unprofessional (but check out their Twitter, it's kind of funny - they really try to seem ""sciency"" but don't really know anything about science I think. The followers are either also bought or baited by some fake giveaways, very few seem to be normal, non-spammy accounts) - no company with multiple millions funding would present themselves like that. Also look at the [start of the email](https://imgur.com/a/tbq5YZ9) they sent me in beautiful red, Scammer 1 didn't even remove the ""initial contact"", which I think is hilarious.

So again, if you see positive posts about this project, it's either the scammers or people with less morals that they approached. Stay away from them as far as possible, at least don't give them money, your personal information, or go to their website/ download their app so they can send you viruses.",20887,2021-06-25 09:06:59,600

USDT,cryptocurrency,"So... are we going to ignore that TRON (TRX), with 7.5 BILLION market cap, is pretty much following LUNA's footsteps?","[TRON (TRX) is currently the #14 coin by market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/). The coin has seen an insane increase over the past couple months.

TRON has recently launched its algorithmic stablecoin [USDD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usdd/). The algorithm governing the stablecoin’s dollar-peg is an arbitrage trade between USDD and TRX, Tron's network’s native token. *Hmm... this reminds me of something but I can't put my finger on it....*

Now here's this week's best offer! [You can earn up to 57% through sun.io's LP!](https://imgur.com/a/JoFQgSH) What a great deal.

According to [Defillama](https://defillama.com/peggedassets/stablecoins) USDD is #10 stablecoin by market cap, with a 20% increase over the past week, this figure is up from $90 million recorded during its day of launch on **May 5, 2022**. *Hmm... I have a vouge memory of something that happened in early May 2022...*

Oh and we haven't even checked the **project's founder, Justin Sun.**

Let's get started:

Justin Sun launched TRON's whitepaper during the ICO craze in 2017, days before China's ban on ICO's. He raised $70 million and left the country. Sun had been **tipped off by Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance.** Does this also sound familiar....? 

On top of that. [it's been also reported that he copy pasted the project's whitepaper from another coin](https://coincentral.com/community-accuses-tron-plagiarizing-whitepaper/). This only adds to the pile of cards that his so called ""algorithmic stablecoin"" is a scam waiting to collapse.

It is no coincidence that Justin also left China, days after the ICO ban was announced.

On top of all that, it's been reported that:

* He hosted a ton of fake giveaways in 2019 announcing fake winners and retracting prizes.

* He announced fake partnerships with big organizations such as Liverpool F.C., who have denied connections.

* It's been reported that Justin has sold most of his TRON coins after the ICO and bought a large chunk of ETH. Some say he owns more ETH than the projects' Co-Founder Vitalik.

[You can read more here](https://www.theverge.com/c/22947663/justin-sun-tron-cryptocurrency-poloniex)

So, what do we make of all these? Justin Sun, the creator of TRX and USDD, not only literally copy pasted everything, he has also been involved in a huge amount of sketchy dealings and scams. 

My hope is that people like Justin and projects like LUNA and TRX are wiped off entirely from the market, for this is the only way to move forward and build something meaningful.

&#x200B;

Alameda received over $36 Billion USDT from Tether up until October 2021, accounting for over 30% of the total USDT issued.  According to Protos, 81% of this was issued between October 2020 –  October 2021. This corresponds to a period of rapid growth in Tether’s  market cap from $15 billion to $71 billion.

 

Tether’s market cap grew massively over 2021, the same period that Alameda received \~80% of its USDT It is possible that some of the USDT Alameda received were later redeemed for real dollars, meaning the net dollar amount sent to Tether by Alameda could be less than $36 billion. However, it is highly improbable that Alameda alone redeemed all $32 billion sent back to Tether in that period. 

&#x200B;

We now  know that SBF and his companies were outright frauds who stole customer  deposits to finance their activities. Theoretically, we could attribute  some of the Tether issuance to stolen funds, but this would not come  anywhere close to $36 billion.

USDT,cryptocurrency,What Is Keeping USDT Pegged To The USD? Breaking Down Tether Reserves,"USDT is one of the most popular stablecoins in the space and it's one of the most used pairs to trade cryptocurrencies. This stablecoin aims to be always pegged 1:1 to the USD. For it to be always worth the same as the USD, the company behind it has to have reserves that match the current supply of USDT circulating.

So what are the Tether reserves?

According to Tether and their independent audit, Tether holds 85,05% of their USDT supply in cash or cash equivalents, 0,13% in corporate bonds, 3,78% in precious metals, 1,94% in Bitcoin, 6,36% in secured loans and 2,73% in other investments. 

The biggest part of this cake can be divided in several different things, cash and cash equivalents can mean many things so lets break it down. Inside the 85,05% of the cash and cash equivalents, 75,86% are U.S Treasury Bills, 12,09% are overnight reverse repurchase agreements, 0,78% are term reverse repurchase agreements, 11,06% are money market funds, 0,12% are cash and bank deposits and 0,09% are non-US Treasury Bills.

All these numbers mean that effectively, real cash is a really small percentage of Tether's holdings. The major holdings according to Tether are U.S Treasury Bills and there's more investments in the middle of this that are not known exactly what they are.

As we know, it only takes a small decline in the reserves to deppeg a stablecoin, supposedly reserves have to be atleast valued at the same as USDT supply. When this audit was made, in the 30th of June, Tether had 67 billion dollars in assets and 66 billion dollars in liabilities, meaning that the reserves had 1 billion dollars more in value than the supply.

Looking at the supply of USDT now, we will find that there are more than 83 billion USDT circulating, meaning that Tether would have to add almost 30 billion dollars to their reserves. Here is where the questions start, does Tether hold 83 billion in reserves right now? Does Tether always hold the same amount of reserves as they have in USDT supply or do they only hold it when an audit is comming.

This is the uncertain that keeps some users worried about Tether, if they don't always hold they reserves accordingly, it only takes something happening like a leak for USDT to come down in a spiral and crash the entire market.

USDT is an important part of the market, even if it's disliked so much. Tether should make more efforts to keep users assured that they are doing things right. Their reputation in the crypto ecosystem is bad and they are accused of all kind of things, one of them being market manipulation.

Will USDT ever be as transparent as they should and finally assure users that they are completely legit and not an house of cards waiting to fall?",19,2023-10-03 20:33:15,90

USDT,cryptocurrency,TIL There is a human-trafficking ring in Cambodia that forces thousands of people to commit pig-butchering scams and likely uses Tether as one of the ways to launder their ill-gotten gains.,"A recent report published by a Bloomberg reporter was made on a human-trafficking ring operated by Chinese gangsters in Cambodia/Myanmar. After he encountered a pig-butchering scam attempt, he went to investigate the connections and culprit behind this scam. What he stumbled upon was a large human trafficking ring that was based in Sihanoukville, Cambodia. Basically, this operation involved luring thousands of people from surrounding countries in Southeast Asia by using lucrative job offers. Once the people arrive in Cambodia and at the compound, they quickly find out that it is not actually a legit job offer, but they are essentially buildings of call centers for orchestrating pig-butchering scams. It is a massive compound that is perched on top of a mountain top, away from prying eyes, and is closely guarded by armed men. Upon arrival, all belongings like passports and mobile phones will be confiscated and it will make it very difficult, if not impossible to leave. For the people who are now stuck there, they are now basically held hostage and forced to work long hours to commit pig-butchering scam.

&#x200B;

>*""Workers who missed quotas were beaten, starved, made to hit one another. One said he’d seen people forcibly injected with methamphetamine to increase productivity. Two others said they’d seen workers murdered, with the deaths passed off as suicides. They said the bosses would buy and sell captive laborers like livestock.""*

&#x200B;

One interesting aspect of this trafficking ring that was reported is that they were using USDT (Tether) to perform transactions from the illegal operation. Usually in these pig-butchering scams, they extract the money from victims by asking them to convert their money into USDT and sending it to some wallet, masquerading as some fake exchange. The reporter also mentioned that when he was there in Cambodia, he would see establishments offering money-transfer services and being advertised in Chinese and Vietnamese. There, he would see Chinese businessmen going to exchange Tether for cash or vice-versa without any documents.

It is also important to note that this particular reporter has also been investigating Tether and the money behind Tether since 2021. I highly recommend for you guys to go through the article because it's a large operation and likely the culprit behind many of the pig-butchering scams we hear about today.

**Edit: I think it's important to say here that this post is made to shed light on underground operations like this trafficking ring and not about putting the blame on crypto. There are plenty of ways to launder money and crypto is just one of them. In addition, pig-butchering scams are getting more and more common using crypto investments as a front. Due to the scale of their operations, it is entirely possible that the person on the other side of these pig-butchering scams you encounter is not doing it out of their own free will and are being coerced.**",26,2023-08-23 09:38:26,93

USDT,cryptocurrency,Forbes put Tether in their top 10 crypto investments for May. Lazy journalism or lack of knowledge?,"Hi everyone,

Yesterday Forbes made an article about the top 10 crypto investments for May. First of all this is a bit late since we're almost in June. Secondly I saw Tether in it. Since Tether is a stablecoin it's very strange to put it in a top 10 crypto investment list. 

**Their top 10 crypto investments for May are:**

1. BTC
2. ETH
3. **USDT**
4. BNB
5. XRP
6. ADA
7. SOL
8. DOT 
9. LTC
10. AVAX

**What they wrote about Tether exactly:**

[USDT explanation in https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/in\/investing\/cryptocurrency\/top-10-cryptocurrencies\/](https://preview.redd.it/wipjiazed82b1.png?width=1036&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c879b351c28f37ae148f965651714c19bafed0c)

They write about Tether being a stablecoin, but they still think it's a good crypto investment for May. Now they say that Tether is favored by investors who are wary of the extreme volatility of other coins, but that's crypto in general right? 

The only argument I can think of is that people that live in countries with hyperinflation 'invest' in USDT to not lose value over their money, but that's also possible if you just convert to US dollars.

In my opinion it's very lazy journalism. Because they almost copy past the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap and put it in the article just to have one. 

**The current top 10 in market cap:**

https://preview.redd.it/8z5o98d3f82b1.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd5fc768cf32fa6857ec7e3800968c877e5bee99

As you can see they only left out USDC, DOGE and MATIC from the current top 10. And they replaced it by DOT (rank 13), LTC (rank 12) and AVAX (rank 17).

**What do you guys think? Is this some lazy journalism or lack of knowledge?**

Thanks for reading!

USDT,cryptocurrency,"I started investing my dad’s money while he knows nothing about crypto, here’s a funny thing that happened.","First of all, My dad asked me to invest some of his money into crypto, as I know a bit about it and I’m doing relatively well. He knows nothing about crypto, but trusts me and acknowledges the volatility. I, in no way, persuaded him to invest in crypto.
Having said that, here’s what happened;

I downloaded a portfolio app on his phone so that he can track the crypto I bought and also so he keeps up with what I’m doing with his money. Naturally, I keep plenty of funds in a stablecoin (in this case usdt) so that I can buy potential dips.
One afternoon I kept getting calls from him on my workphone (he never calls me on my workphone). Flustered, I picked up the phone during an important meeting, fearing something bad had happened. When I picked up he said the most boomer thing I ever heard him say ‘Hey, I have been tracking this coin usdt you bought, and it is not doing much, it’s not fluctuating at all, but I’m really, really expecting a rise soon, what do you think?!’

I found it absolutely adorable and dumb at the same time. I explained everything to him and we had a good laugh about it. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share this giggle I had. Hope it also brings you some joy in these trying times.

EDIT: Wow, this post really exploded. Thanks for all the awards and love kind strangers. I see there is some controversy about the whole 'Tether' thing. I appreciate you guys looking out for me and my father. I truly do. Having said that, I don't feel the need to fuel this discussion. I think everyone is entitled to his own crypto choices and my dad trusts me enough to make those choices for him. It was not the intention of this post to start a tether-riot. It was simply meant to share a funny crypto-related story. Oh, and for the people saying this is a repost. I did try to post this about a month ago I think, but it got instantly deleted by the mods because I didn't have the required Comment Karma to post on this subreddit. I just thought I'd try to share my story again now having the required Karma. Anyway, I hope all of you have a wonderful crypto-journey. I'm still reading all the comments. It truly makes my day! Much love.",4208,2021-09-13 18:26:57,1114
USDT,cryptocurrency,"The name of the game for big corporations is to make interest on your deposits. It is likely what PayPal is aiming for with the launch of their stablecoin, PYUSD and why Tether is one of the most profitable companies in the world.","So we have all heard about it now. PayPal is debuting its shiny new stablecoin, PYUSD which is issued by Paxos Trust Company on the Ethereum blockchain. Sure, some of us in this sub has been discussing about PayPal's intention to launch its own stablecoin amid all the regulatory bullshit and how it could help with mainstream adoption despite its feature of being able to be frozen and controlled by PayPal. 

However, a new article on Coindesk recently came out that suggested PayPal's real intention of offering stablecoins is that they can use customers' funds to buy US Treasury Bills (T-bills) and earn interest on these deposits without giving customers any part of the interest. At year-end 2022, they reported customer accounts funds to be at $36.5 billion. Imagine now that they can issue stablecoins and have them backed by T-bills using customer funds. Essentially, PayPal can become its own money printer (not surprising). 

&#x200B;

Then, I took a look at Tether's quarterly report and saw why this might be one of the most profitable businesses in the world. Tether currently holds **$86.5 billion in assets** as a reserve backing UDST. Note that a large proportion of it is being held in US T-Bills, approximately **$55.8 billion**. Currently, US T-Bills are offering an interest of 5% per annum, which means Tether is earning a staggering interest of **$2.79 billion** just on holding T-bills alone.

&#x200B;

Once the corporations realize that this is just another iteration of fractional reserve banking, more and more will follow suit and start issuing stablecoins. Give it a thought the next time you keep balances on PayPal or any other money services. You are essentially giving them a 0% interest loan and having them earn interest on them. 

&#x200B;

**TLDR; The stablecoin industry is very profitable, which is why PayPal wants a slice of the pie. Tether is rolling in the cash for doing mostly nothing.**

USDT,cryptocurrency,The Ethereum triple halving and why ETH will easily overtake BTC in marketcap,"&#x200B;

So, why do I make such a confident claim as to why Ethereum will easily surpass BTC as the largest cryptocurrency by almost every metric including market cap? Simply put, its because the Ethereum selling pressure is going to reduce by as much as 90% – the equivalent of three Bitcoin halvenings in the span of 12 months. ETH will experience what is known as a triple halving, yes you read that right, a triple halving. To understand the triple halving of ETH we need to first understand what the BTC halving is:

* A Bitcoin halving event is when the reward for mining bitcoin transactions is cut in half.
* This event also cuts in half Bitcoin's inflation rate and the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation.
* It is widely thought that all previous halvenings are closely correlated to the initiation of bull market cycles leading to much higher prices than previous cycles.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ya4ccg2yuqh71.png?width=1070&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb05471edf3ba58045ef2534d2b377c4f5413c91

Ethereum will undergo a triple halving, or in other words, 50% \* 50% \* 50% = 12.5%, i.e. a 87.5% reduction in issuance which is the equivalent to 3 consecutive Bitcoin halving events. The upcoming Triple Halving will likely lead to a price explosion that I believe will allow ETH to easily overtake BTC in market cap. In this post I will discuss \*\*two\*\* key events that lead to the triple halving and why ETH will then easily overtake BTC as the most dominant crypto currency.

* The first event, and likely the least impactful of the two events will be caused by EIP-1559. On August 5th, EIP-1559 was passed, which means that 70% of the transaction fees in Ethereum will continually be burned. The more the network is used, the more fees will be burned. It is expected that with the deployment of EIP-1559, Ethereum would become net deflationary and stand at 2% negative annual issuance. In just one week over $100M of ETH was burned, this is insane. The drop in sell pressure represents a 30% reduction with the release of EIP-1559 which represent just over half of one BTC halving

https://preview.redd.it/cneo5zbzuqh71.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=636dc44bcedbadf71323f6e2ba73c5e23ced28f1

* The second (and very significant) cause would be the transition to Proof of Stake (POS) from Proof of Work (POW). To understand what this means we firstly need to understand Ethereum mining. As it stands, approximately 12,800 ETH (equivalent to $39,000,000) is rewarded to miners for running the Ethereum network and keeping it secure every day. Since ETH is still in a Proof of Work system most of this ETH is immediately dumped and sold into the market. Since the miners run a cash business, they need cash for electricity, equipment, paying investors etc. So everyday there is \*\*at least\*\* $39,000,000 worth of selling pressure for ETH each and every day. The implications for this transition means that ETH will go from a mine and dump economy (POW) to a stake and restake economy (POS). POS encourages saving as the more ETH you have the bigger your monetary benefit; this will not be for true all people as of course people will still sell a lot of ETH but most people will hold and restake their rewards as time goes by, enormously reducing sell pressure.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2y8ue7j0vqh71.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5767436475c53af3d23266a2edb01c4cfde5998

So now you know what the ETH triple halving will lead to ETH being deflationary and have a \~90% reduction in sell pressure, we will discuss why ETH will overtake BTC in market dominance. Firstly, price leads narrative. A narrative by itself potentially creates a price increase. A narrative with a significant price increase validates the narrative and induces a price explosion. The following events will convince any investor that ETH is ultra sound money:

1. Exploding active accounts and transaction volume
2. Low fees - The most significant problem with Ethereum is scalability and is about to be solved, once and for all. The Layer 2 deployment is in full swing and the transaction fees will come down in the future
3. Powerful DeFi & staking yields
4. An environmentally-friendly Ethereum 2.0. ETH 2.0 will require 99% less energy to run and this is required to break into mainstream adoption. This is an obstacle where BTC failed. BTC is currently using up 0.7% of the world’s electricity while only serving 50 million people and you would likely need to use 70% to serve 5B (Full global adoption). Climate protection is the number one agenda in many developed countries and simply for this reason is why BTC will never truly be able to become mainstream

Another likely scenario is sooner rather than later Elon Musk will ride the ETH bandwagon, the news of Elon Musk praising Ethereum’s soon upcoming launch of energy-friendly Ethereum 2.0 POS will be enough to propel ETH to 5 digits alone whether this is a good or bad thing is another debate in of itself.

&#x200B;

Now, we must also take into account that all this will be happening when there is record demand for access to the Ethereum blockchain for DeFi and NFT's. ETH is simply too important relative to BTC. Ethereum has flipped Bitcoin in every important metric, the last remaining metric is the market cap and that is only one 2.5x of Ethereum away.

But now you may ask, isn't this narrative already priced in? Well no, I don't believe so. The Triple Halving narrative only came into existence on April 27th (A 79 page investment report on why ETH could hit $150,000 by 2023 can be found on this link [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing) ) how many of you had even heard of the ETH triple halving before reading this post? The average person will have no clue what even an Ethereum is but almost everyone has heard of BTC. In the last cycle the world discovered BTC not ETH, this cycle the world will discover ETH. BTC's first mover advantage will only take it so far and over time will begin to mean less and less. The shifting narrative of BTC to ETH will come as a result of BTC failing to be environmentally friendly and BTC will always fail at this hurdle as well as the very limited utility of BTC. Another reason why its unlikely this has been priced in yet is the Bitcoin halving was never priced in even though people knew about it 4 years in advance and it always led to a 100x price increase.

Now we must also discuss some major reasons why this laid out foundation for the price of ETH to explode could be hindered. The journey for ETH will not be straight forward by any means and will likely be plagued by delays and many other unforeseen events.

* Scaling could fail to reduce fees - Adoption can be too fast or Optimism is delayed or not adopted quickly enough by the main gas consumers (Uniswap and Tether).
* POS is delayed - This is ETH we are talking about and this scenario is very likely to happen. POS is scheduled for late 2021 but will more likely come in early 2022
* Transaction fees end up being so low that due to scaling or lack of usage (bear market) - If Ethereum scales too well, fee burns would not have such a big impact on price.

There are also some other issues that are less likely to occur such as a $10 Trillion market cap ETH could cause a regulatory risk as an unregulated decentralized entity being worth so much is a scary prospect for many governments to deal with.

TLDR: ETH is already beating BTC in almost every important metric except market cap, with the EIP-1559 update and upcoming transition to POS ETH will loses 90% of its sell pressure or the equivalent of three BTC halvings in the timespan of 12 months leading to a price explosion that some predict could hit $150,000 by 2023 ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing)).

Bullshit that has already been denied, like Tether holding Evergrande.. 
Infact this nonsense claims 78% of Tether reserves are Evergrande, which is total lies.

And that OP RT's nonsense like this, wishing for crypto to burn, but you all are assuming he is posting his ""unbiased opinion"" on bitcoin law. Lol


Edit:

Some comments are pointing out that I havent deboonked what that OP has said. I did actualyl debunk him last month, but then realised he isnt having honest debates but is just putting out propaganda. Given that he isnt acting in good faith, and is a buttcoiner, kinda pointless for me to debunk moreover, he is clearly lying that he wants to see crypto succeed, and instead has a very biased agenda. He is not debating in good faith. If you check his profile, he had posted that BTC would be a failure even before the roll out. Literally, before the plan was implemented and went live, he claimed it would be a failure. Anyone really expect this guy to be unbaised at this point? 

Coming to the protests, yes there are protests, but the protests are to do with politics rather than bitcoin. You will find one or two guys carrying an anti-bitcoin banner in the entire protest. Most of the protests are purely due to political reasons, that have nothing to do with Bitcoin. All those pictures he has posted as proof are all from protests shared on twitter, they have nothing to do with bitcoin except that fact that Bitcoin is implemented by the president, against whom all the protests are targeted. 

That guy claims Bitcoin rollout is ""not going well"". 

Stats from Google app store and IOS app store prove him wrong. 

The Chivo wallet is still #2 on ios app store, ahead of most viral apps like FB/ Whatsapp/Twitter/TikTok etc

https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/apple/store-rank/sv/all/


And on Android play store, the wallet is the #1 app too..

https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/google/store-rank/sv/all

The Chivo app is pretty much TOP on both app stores. Quite some failure huh! Definitely not doing well...

Just because there have been some issues during rollout doesnt mean its a failure or its not going well. Many mass implementation programs have problems initially, infact even the US covid stimmy checks took a while to arrive and there was implementation delays. Later, [WaPo reported that over 1 M checks went out to dead people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/06/25/irs-stimulus-checks-dead-people-gao/). Was that a failure too? 

Now lets look at some real stories that are success:

Over 3 million  users have downloaded the wallet. 

[More users in El Salvador are now using Chivo / have a bitcoin wallet than they have traditional bank accounts.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2021/10/07/in-el-salvador-more-people-have-bitcoin-wallets-than-traditional-bank-accounts/?sh=7ac1bb5020b5) - This alone is a massive win, in a country where huge amounts of people are unbanked, they have now instantly been given access to the world's most open and fair financial network. 

 Already, Brazil is considering following El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as well.


A country implementing BTC is not a race to the finish, it is a long term program. OP knows that too, but since he is a biased propagandist, he wants to put out hit pieces on a monthly basis 

That guy is just grinding his grudge against the president who he clearly hates, and using this sub as an outlet to air his political hit posts.",4208,2021-10-08 14:07:14,892

&#x200B;

I'm here to demonstrate that ***even if you never touch USDT yourself,*** **you are indirectly using it if you're invested in** ***any*** **cryptocurrency.**

The main issue is: **USDT has more daily trading volume than all other 9 top-10 cryptoassets combined.**

It's safe to say that USDT is responsible for **over half the market's liquidity**.

As of this moment, the top10 cryptoassets by marketcap, and their daily trading volumes are:

* Bitcoin, with a daily trading volume of 5.837 billion USD
* Ethereum, with a daily trading volume of 2.564 billion USD
* **USDT, with a daily trading volume of 11.541 billion** USD
* BNB, with a daily trading volume of 0.267 billion USD
* XRP, with a daily trading volume of 0.386 billion USD
* USDC, with a daily trading volume of 1.443 billion USD
* ADA, with a daily trading volume of 0.100 billion USD
* DOGE, with a daily trading volume of 0.174 billion USD
* SOL, with a daily trading volume of 0.348 billion USD
* TRX, with a daily trading volume of 0.102 billion USD

&#x200B;

If you sum up all the trading volume of the other 9 coins you get a daily trading volume of **11.221 billion USD.** Meanwhile USDT's trading volume **is 11.541 billion**.

[https://www.coindesk.com/tether-first-reserve-composition-report-usdt](https://www.coindesk.com/tether-first-reserve-composition-report-usdt)

Binance is currently holding $17 BILLION Tether in its wallet. [https://wallet.tether.to/richlist](https://wallet.tether.to/richlist) .

The cycle seems something like this: Binance puts up some amount of collateral to Tether Treasury (likely some cash with the rest ""commercial paper""). Tether prints more Tether, loans it to Binance. Binance uses the new magic minted tether to give margin traders higher leverage to buy more Bitcoin....Bitcoin price goes up, more capital comes in, never ending cycle continues.  You should get the picture why this is bad without the word ""PONZI""

Multiple countries are once again cracking down on Binance. We've seen this happen before, but there's no certainty regulators won't come down harder this time. Any number of things could trigger a rush of withdrawals (eg. a margin-call on all leveraged accounts) from Binance

IF there is a sudden rush of withdrawals from Binance for whatever reason (and that rush coincides with a drop in Bitcoin prices), the exchange is going to have a dual monster on their hands. Say the US and EU regulators decide to team up to hit Binance/Binance.US with some mega regulations.

Coinciding with a decrease in BTC price, they're also going to be margin-calling a ton of those leverage accounts...inevitably resulting in heavily forced liquidations (to USDT). 

If that worst-case scenario happens, at some point they're also going to have to try to redeem all that tether they're holding for cash. But...as we've recently learned, Tether does not likely have any account with billions of dollars in liquid cash available, and Binance has an ""IOU"" with them anyway....so Tether says ""sorry Binance, you have this on loan, you're SOL"".

There is no telling how leveraged Binance is in unbacked Tethers.

So what does Binance do when they can't get liquidity to facilitate withdrawals?

It's not that unrealistic of a story given the current environment. If you need to use Binance, it should be a quick in and out.  Until things chill out with the regulatory environment, leaving any coins in there is asking to get burned.

**edit**

This post seems to have ruffled some feathers. To be clear I’m not saying this scenario will definitely play out. I’m saying this is a not impossible risk that exists with Binance, and there is no point absorbing the risk when alternatives to storing your coins exist. 

If you’re someone who thinks acknowledging and discussing risk is automatically “FUD”, and this sort of topic scares you, maybe investing in a high risk asset like crypto isn’t for you?",663,2021-07-18 00:22:07,587

USDT,cryptocurrency,Opinion: collapse of USDT,"The collapse of USDT is one that I believe is impending and, honestly, looking forward to (so my analysis may be biased). Obligatory ""I've been in the space for a while and seen a few things.""

First and foremost, people are exiting out of Tether. This isn't a normal retail exit. When someone exchanges USDT for USDC, for example, on an exchange, that's not a real exit of USDT. The chart below shows that since May 2022, there have been billions of USDT being exited into cash. In May, the market cap of Tether (i.e., the total supply) sat at $83B. Today, it sits at $70B. So there is $13B tether liquidated from the market.

https://preview.redd.it/mfrr64jdup591.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcd64df8e693ca65f126f3980b7f06911b5a2413

The problem with this $13B liquidation though, originates at the source of this [report published by Tether](https://assets.ctfassets.net/vyse88cgwfbl/4EtXPBkmEPDNbIHNajz9vQ/bb4766acfe36f5af0c4e54a2694c8a31/tether-march-31-2021-reserves-breakdown.pdf), stating that only 2.94% of its reserves are in cash. The pie chart in that document is a bit misleading -- it says 3.87%, but it is 3.87% of the 75.85% category of ""Cash & Cash Equivalents & Other Short Term Deposits & Commercial Paper.""

That report was published on March 31, 2021. At that time, the market cap of Tether was \~$62B (see chart below). 2.94% of that is $1.8B. We can also play out a second scenario: assume the cash reserves grew in tandem with the market cap. If that's the case, then at $83B, $2.4B would be in cash reserve.

https://preview.redd.it/vju5zl19wp591.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8c87c7a90edb13490d92c16b74f56c3aa9dd5e1

Regardless of whether we take the $1.8B or $2.4B as true, those are both peanuts compared to the $13B liquidated from Tether in the past month. In fact, the liquidations would be 5.3x to 7.1x more than what Tether has in supposed cash reserves. To be able to account for this liquidation with actual cash, Tether would need to have 16% of its reserve in cash. I doubt it.

So in my opinion, I now assume that Tether is dry of its cash reserves. This is where things start to get sticky. We can categorize their holdings into three categories: liquid, short-term, and long-term:

* Liquid is basically cash (2.94%). These are things Tether can reach for to cover the cash people are asking for when they exit from Tether immediately. As I just talked about, my assumption is they're out of this.
* Short-term is stuff they can potentially liquidate quickly (potentially at a penalty, so the value is not 1:1 necessarily) if they really need to, in order to cover the cash people are still asking for after they run out of liquid. We assume that 72.9% of Tether's supply (78.85% - 2.94%) can be categorized as this although ""short-term"" in this case is really subjective. Out of this 72.9%, I assume that USDT has already dipped into \~13% (16% - 2.94%). So approximately 60% is left over.
* Long-term is everything else: 24.15% (100% - 75.85%). These are things that just can't really be liquidated easily except at extreme penalty. Also to note, out of the 24.15% we can safely assume the ""other investments"" category of 1.64% is probably useless and less than 1.64% now because 1) it includes investments in crypto, and 2) the crypto market has crashed. These could be illiquid investments into projects that don't have tokens on the secondary market yet, or they could be other cryptoassets, which probably will come at a significant premium if liquidated quickly (we don't know how much of these investments are liquid or illiquid, but either way we can say that it's fairly useless in this market). If Tether needs to tap into the long-term category, it's already pretty much game over.

And the name of the game is bank run. Bank run on an unsustainable model destroyed Luna/Terra, and bank run can destroy Tether as well. For those that don't know, a bank run happens when people all run to the bank to cash out at the same time. The bank doesn't have enough cash to give to everyone, which causes more panic and more people demanding to cash out. Ultimately, trust in the currency is lost, and people start cashing out at lower market value, tumbling the value of the currency into oblivion.

The bank run for Tether would begin as what looks like normal withdrawals, which can be covered by its liquid assets. This would be a 1:1 exchange. Based on my back-of-the-napkin math explained above, I believe the liquid assets are exhausted. Now Tether is tapping into its short-term assets. Some of these may come at a slight cost to liquidate (market volatility, penalties, etc.). This would not be a 1:1 exchange, so Tether needs to liquidate a bit extra to cover everyone who's asking for a dollar. I don't believe the short-term assets are all exhausted yet, so Tether can continue to carry this charade for a bit longer. In the event that people start to liquidate more USDT, then Tether will exhaust its short-term assets and have to tap into its long-term assets. If the flag hasn't been raised up to this point, it's certainly full mast now. The long-term assets are hard to immediately liquidate without penalties or market impact. Anyway, you see the picture.

With the cash reserve at Tether exhausted, I believe it marks the beginning of a potential bank run. In the recent 2018 crash, you can see that the confidence in Tether barely faltered (barely noticeable the amount being . In fact, the printing of Tether continues at a much more rapid pace moving forward. The market was still dependent on Tether.

https://preview.redd.it/c7ost7ekzp591.png?width=1892&format=png&auto=webp&s=581de5fcaca690244273ec0426a8b702efc41792

But in May 2022, the severe liquidation of Tether began. That's the steep drop at the end of the blue line. With the crash of UST and the depegging of algorithmic stablecoins, I think the industry trust and sentiment towards stablecoins in general has faltered. And for good reason--taking a look at USDT, we can see that it has not recovered its peg to $1 since May 10 (see image below), which is right around the time that the major liquidations of USDT began.

https://preview.redd.it/z16n8xhz1q591.png?width=1510&format=png&auto=webp&s=803bc5e6e4ae62405c313afe3992f08f92bd38b7

The bear market in crypto, combined with all this news around big players like Luna/Terra, Celsius, and (potentially) 3AC collapsing, combined with all of the macro signals that indicate a recession (inflation, fed interest rate hikes, global war, food shortages, etc) are pushing people to get out of risky assets. As a result, we see the price of crypto dropping. And the circulation of USDT along with it. So people aren't just exiting cryptos into stablecoins; they're exiting USDT as well.

They are exiting USDT and either going into fiat or liquidating into other assets like USDC. You can see the chart for USDC market cap below, which started printing the same day that USDT collapsed, and has been growing in circulation ever since.

https://preview.redd.it/vpe7uhap2q591.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=c490b647446d1593ebe4d2870a51d94ca958e1bc

I think this is at least some indicator that people aren't just exiting crypto altogether, but also the trust and, ultimately, dependence, on USDT is waning. Following this current trajectory, I think there are a couple of scenarios that could result:

1. USDT remains pegged to $1.
2. USDT depegs from the dollar very quickly due to a bank run from lack of confidence in USDT. This would ultimately result in the collapse of USDT. This depeg would likely put significant stress on the market.
3. USDT doesn't immediately depeg from the dollar, but dependence on USDT wanes, such that eventually once USDT does depeg, it doesn't affect the market very significantly.

And this is where my bias sets in. I don't wish harm or financial difficulty on anyone, and I mean no ill will to the Tether team. But I do hope that Tether also gets wiped during this crash. I think part of Tether's demise is already baked into the market, and evidence of this is demonstrated throughout this piece. On a more philosophical tone, Tether's demise is one that, I believe, is necessary for web3 to continue to grow in a healthy and sustainable manner. This market has been brutal to the unsustainable models, and I hope that Tether is no exception. It is a symbol of a broken system, and a collective delusion of the market that indicate that the market itself isn't ready to be taken seriously.",441,2022-06-15 05:58:35,491

However, it still amazes me how weak the response to the depeg was overall, from the media and regulators who would usually seize the chance and start discussing how the stablecoin issuer (Circle) will be taken to court, from the market ( honestly I have expected a much bigger sellout due to this de-peg, but the markets didn't move much), and finally from social media, where people soon divided on whether or not to swap their USDC and started joking about how they expected this happening to USDT instead of USDC.

Basically everyone seems to not trust USDT (or at least that's what it looks like it on this sub), but still, this stable has ~73B$ MarketCap compared to USDC's ~40B$. While most people seems to trust it with their funds, most people seem to have a sum of their portfolio ready to short it at the least possible depeg. 

I know crypto doesn't usually make sense anyway, but what do you think about the stablecoin landscape in the near future? Do you think USDT will be the crowned king after it survived the SBV crash? Or is it doomed to be an ""IoU"" that might expire at any moment? And will you still trust your funds with USDC?",174,2023-03-13 09:13:08,561

USDT,cryptocurrency,Bye bye USDT!,"Hello guys! I hope you are well.

Even though USDT is a titan in the crypto market, it is very well known that USDT is, at the very least, shady. Very poor transparency from their end and a coin backed by very little real USD. In fact, the majority of posts here warn people about Tether and suggest we stay away from them. Tether = bad.

What if big exchanges and the majority of users finally saw the problems with Tether and slowly drifted away from it? Well, that day may be closer than it seems!

To my surprise, I got an email today from [coinsmart](https://www.coinsmart.com/) where they informed their users that they are ending USDT support soon. They will stop trading USDT **altogether**!

This, to me, is good news. Hopefully, more and more exchanges will take similar steps and the crypto market can grow healthier and stronger.

Goodbye USDT, you won't be missed!

Edit: Thank you kind people for the awards!

USDT,cryptocurrency,"AMA Announcement: Unveiling the Future of Decentralized AI and Software Development with Tau Net ($AGRS) - March 25th, 6pm UTC - 1500 USDT Giveaway"," Greetings, r/Cryptocurrency community!

We're thrilled to announce that the Tau Net team will be hosting an AMA session right here on **March 25th at 6pm UTC**. This is your chance to dive deep into the innovative world of Tau Net & Agoras ($AGRS), a project at the forefront of reshaping how we conceive software development and decentralized AI.

**1500 USDT Giveaway**

To make this AMA extra special, we're giving away **1500 USDT** to the top 15 questions (100 USDT each). Share your most insightful, curious, or inspiring questions for a chance to win.

**Who We Are**

We are Tau (www.tau.net), a ten year old software company pioneering **logical AI** software development. We’ve developed a novel formal specification language, called Tau Language, intended for precise and accurate development of mission critical systems and complex software. Our novel use of formal specification enables **correct-by-construction software development**, thereby eliminating many of the problems that software development and machine learning AI still face, e.g. bugs, traditional testing costs, hefty maintenance, AI hallucination and many technical barriers to participation in development, ultimately enabling anyone to be a developer.

**What is Tau Net**

Tau Net is a decentralized blockchain network fully controlled, governed and developed by its entire user base in a sound manner. By allowing all users to write information in its system e.g. human knowledge, personal opinions and desired behavior for the system to function in logical sentences that work as formal specifications, these sentences are directly executable and thereby function as working software. Tau Net logically reasons over the collective requirements given by its users and detects the agreement on how they want it to function, and puts its own next version as the next block in its blockchain, evolving from block to block, resulting in rapid collaborative development.

**Agoras: Currency of Tau**

Agoras is the currency of Tau Net. $AGRS pioneers in facilitating the exchange of knowledge, computational assets, and derivatives within the Tau Net ecosystem. Uniquely, $AGRS stands as the world’s first token with user-controlled tokenomics. Users describe in logical sentences how they want $AGRS to be like and Tau Net automatically detects and implements the agreement as executable software, empowers Tau Net’s users to effortlessly modify the tokenomics, simply by voicing their desired specification.

**What are our breakthroughs?**

NVIDIA’s CEO shares a vision similar to our future of Software and AI ([https://x.com/Carnage4Life/status/1761483377365152234?s=20](https://x.com/Carnage4Life/status/1761483377365152234?s=20)).

Tau Net introduces the concept of ""Software as Sentences."" This is a new method of developing software, utilizing executable formal specifications, different from code and typical machine learning e.g. ChatGPT. It enables users to describe how they want the network to be like in logical sentences. These logical sentences are processed and understood by the network and directly executable as software, accurate according to the description. Agoras ($AGRS) leverages this technology to allow user-controlled tokenomics, and a decentralized marketplace for knowledge, derivatives, and computational resources.

**Redefining AI: Logic-based AI vs. ML-based AI**

Today’s most popular AI applications (ChatGPT, Bard, etc) rely on machine learning, a probabilistic approach which is unable to guarantee accurate results. Contrarily, Tau Net employs logic-based AI, thereby being able to handle logical reasoning and deduce new facts from given knowledge, all while guaranteeing that the result is completely accurate according to knowledge provided. In addition, Tau Net is also able to explain to the user how it arrived at a result. Therefore, Tau Net is superior in its reasoning capabilities compared to machine learning based alternatives. By offering formal proofs of correctness, it addresses a pivotal challenge in the AI domain achieving absolute certainty in outcomes.

**User-Controlled Software and AI Governance**

On Tau Net, users are granted unprecedented control over the network. Tau Net provides an effective solution to the AI alignment problem by enabling users to define rules or embed regulations directly within its software. These rules are adhered to with proof, even after any future updates. It possesses the unique capability to automatically reject any attempts at tampering with its software, especially if such attempts aim to introduce undesired behavior. For instance, if the command ""Never send private data over the network"" is embedded, Tau Net will consistently honor this rule, automatically rejecting any future updates that contravene it. This level of software integrity and compliance is unparalleled in the technology domain and important to ensure system integrity.

**Unlocking AGI: Collective Intelligence and Combined Brainpower on Tau Net**

On Tau Net, collective intelligence emerges as users input their knowledge via descriptions in logical sentences enabled by Tau Language. Tau Net is able to reason over given knowledge, as well as combining knowledge and thereby deducing new enlightening facts and groundbreaking discoveries. Every piece of knowledge becomes maximally useful, lying dormant until connected with another fact, potentially yielding solutions to some of the world's biggest problems. This synergy propels Tau Net on the fastest path towards realizing AGI, marking a pivotal shift in how we harness and leverage collective intelligence for humanity’s betterment. Furthermore, this paradigm facilitates a knowledge market to trade and connect knowledge and brain power using $AGRS.

**Conclusion**

While many blockchain initiatives, such as Bitcoin, proclaim decentralization, they operate under centralized development teams. Contrarily, Tau Net may be described as a decentralized, expansive reasoning system, that empowers users to contribute information that simultaneously serves as software, which Tau Net is able process and integrate into subsequent versions. This unique approach fosters mass collective intelligence, enabling rapid, robust collaborative development, and truly decentralizes the development process in a coherent manner.

**Upcoming Milestones: Tau Language & Testnet**

We're on the brink of releasing the **Tau Language and Testnet**, major milestones that will significantly enhance our ecosystem's capabilities. These developments are a testament to our commitment to innovation and our vision for a decentralized future.

**Join Us: AMA Details and Resources**

Mark your calendars for **March 25th at 6pm UTC** and prepare your questions. Whether you're curious about the technical aspects, the vision behind Tau Net, or how you can get involved, we're here to answer.

USDT,cryptocurrency,"If you had invested $1000 in USDT a year ago , your current value would be $1050 by staking it. The ""neutral"" side of investing into Crypto which no one talks about.","We’ve all see the headlines about SHIB, DOGE and other coins, ""*$1000 a year ago would be millions today"",* but to get those gains you'd need to invest really early.

Through this sub we now have also seen what would have happened if you had invested your money into coins like Squid, Shibafever or BabyKrypto.

But what would have happened if you tried to keep your risk low, by investing into stabilized coins? If you would have invested $1000 a year ago into the following coins and staked them with an APY of 5% you would have:

* Tether - would be worth $1050 today
* USD Coin - would be worth $1050 today
* Dai - would be worth $1050 today

Considering an inflation of 3% you'd still be up 2%. It isn't much but still way better than just letting your money rot at the bank.

He tried moving them to curve and it failed

Meanwhile the hacker got swamped by beggars, asking him for money. Some were recommending him tips on how to launder (like using Tornado Cash) and looking for a reward.  

Im not sure if the hacker is really unaware of dapps like Tornado Cash but anyways he seemed to play along and asked people ""TEACH ME PLZ!""

The whole thing is like watching money heist IRL lol 

Meanwhile the polynetwork team posted a cringy message asking the hacker to return the funds otherwise there will be legal consequences. 

The hacker then said he is not interested in the money, and his latest message seems to indicate he will create a token and the DAO will decide on the fate.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Cardano does not have USDT and USDC because it adheres to the principles of decentralization at the protocol design level and does not allow token issuers to censor transactions. Ethereum/Polygon/EVM USDT & USDC solidity contracts can freeze your funds and zero out your balance.,"**Cardano** employs a so-called **multi-asset ledger**. **Tokens are stored directly in the ledger and treated similarly to ADA coins**. **No smart  contract is needed to mint tokens on Cardano**. Issuers must define a minting policy script and sign a specially created mint transaction. 

To issue tokens on EVM platforms, it is necessary to deploy a smart contract, which is then used for transferring tokens. The token issuer can define support for transaction censorship and token freezing in the  contract. Let's explore how the two approaches differ and think about  what Cardano should be.

TLDR

* USDT and USDC can only be issued by complying with the requirements of the regulators.
* The ecosystem's dependence on a stablecoin that can be frozen at any time by a centralized entity is very dangerous.
* Cardano does not have USDT and USDC because it is unable to meet the requirements of the regulators.
* **Owners are always in full control of their tokens in the Cardano ecosystem. Even the issuer cannot change that.**
* It can't be said that Cardano has fewer capabilities than EVM platforms just because it doesn't allow transaction censorship.

Regulatory Compliant Stablecoins

The  issuers of the well-known stablecoins USDT and USDC had to comply with  the requirements of regulators in order to be allowed to tokenize USD on  blockchain platforms. It's important to note that this has brought huge liquidity to the ecosystem and stablecoins are one of by far the most  used tokens. DeFi ecosystems definitely benefit from the ability to use  this kind of stablecoins. Unfortunately, and users are not always fully  aware of this, this comes at the cost of violating the basic principles  of decentralization.

 See for yourself what the smart contract for Tether USD contains.

**How is it actually possible to censor transactions on EVM-compatible platforms?**

When people want to mint fungible tokens on Ethereum, they use standards like ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155. These standards are essentially smart contracts. Smart contracts define a common list of rules that EVM tokens should adhere to. A customized and deployed smart contract is then used each time tokens move from address to address. **A smart contract can define any behavior that EVM will allow and this can be the ability to censor transactions based on a blacklist or freeze an account. The owner may lose the ability to spend or use the tokens in any way.** 

 A deployed smart contract can never be stopped or otherwise manipulated by a third party. **Ethereum** and other EVM-compatible platforms are mostly decentralized at the network level. **Token issuers, however, can write whatever they want in smart contracts**, including the things described above. 

**People sometimes ask why Cardano doesn't have USDT and USDC. Cardano is unable to censor transactions or freeze an account. All tokens have exactly the same properties as ADA coins.** Transfer of tokens is done directly by the protocol through transactions. 

**Cardano has an accounting infrastructure for assets defined in the ledger model and can transfer tokens and NFTs natively. Tokens are stored directly in the ledger similar to ADA coins.**

**No smart contract is needed to mint tokens on Cardano. Issuers must define a minting policy (monetary script) and sign a specially created mint transaction**. The rules might specify who (what private key owner) has control over the asset supply through minting and burning. The owner of the private key (issuer) can only burn tokens that he has at his address. 

**It is not possible to affect the existence of tokens at other users' addresses in any way. In other words, the issuer is not able to burn coins remotely or restrict the token owner from signing the transaction and sending the tokens.**

Once the tokens are minted, Cardano does not need any smart contract to interact with the tokens. All the logic for transmission, transaction fee calculation, etc. happens at the protocol level, similar to sending ADA coins. **Owners are always in full control of their tokens and the issuer cannot change that.**

Cardano stablecoins like [DJED](https://cotinetwork.medium.com/why-djed-should-be-referred-to-as-an-overcollateralized-stablecoin-and-not-an-algorithmic-332637d1e741), [USDA](https://emurgo.io/emurgo-introduces-first-usd-backed-stablecoin-for-the-cardano-ecosystem/), [iUSD](https://indigoprotocol.io/) are native assets i.e. you have full custody and they can't be frozen.

USDT,cryptocurrency,"Solend, the largest lending market on Solana is about to have a crippling liquidation of $170m SOL that could crash the network. To prevent this, the decentralized protocol is proposing to seize the user's funds via governance","There is a large liquidation watch on Solana's Solend protocol, where a whale has  deposited 5.7M SOL  ($170M and borrowed 108M USDC and USDT borrowed. This alone accounts for a huge % of borrowing on Solana, and now this position is under a liquidation threat. 

The whale is not closing their position. In most protocols like Compound, or AAVE, Maker etc, this will result in an onchain liquidation. Infact we have seen many such large liquidations on AAVE And Maker recently, and everything has worked as expected. 

However such a large liquidation in an illiquid market and unstable network like Solana is likely to have vastly damaging consequences. Solana network has already gone down and halted half a dozen time. 

The Solend team explains what could happen to the network:

>This  could cause chaos, putting a strain on the Solana network. Liquidators  would be especially active and spamming the liquidate function, which  has been known to be a factor causing Solana to go down in the past.  
>  
>**Letting a liquidation of this size to happen on-chain is extremely risky.**  DEX liquidity isn’t deep enough to handle a sale of this size and could  cause cascading effects. Additionally, liquidators will be incentivized  to spam the network in an effort to win very lucrative liquidations.  This has been known to cause load issues for Solana in the past which  would exacerbate the problems at hand.

So to prevent this, they are proposing to literally steal the user's funds and execute OTC trades:

>Grant  emergency power to Solend Labs to temporarily take over the whale’s  account so the liquidation can be executed OTC and avoid pushing Solana  to its limits. This would be done via a smart contract upgrade.  Emergency powers will be revoked once the whale’s account reaches a safe  level.

When shit starts to implode, all the true colors of decentralization comes out. 

These shitty protocol are run by fly by night cowboys who learnt basics of economics during the bull run. They put their users are risk by running terrible protocols that do not think about all the edge cases...because who cares about risks right?! 

And during signs of distress, they resolve to seize user funds.",11519,2022-06-19 11:17:30,2241
USDT,cryptocurrency,Remember all the USDT FUD a few months ago?,"Among all the MOONS posts, a slightly different view.

A few months ago r/cc was on high alert because USDT was ""losing it's peg"". Articles were posted left and right and people felt like sh\*t was going to hit the fan.

Now, more than half a year later, we're seeing the same levels for USDT, but nobody seems to notice. Why? - a little distracted by the good news surrounding MOONS in think ;)

This is a prime example of what sentiment can do to your judgement. In November last year the general sentiment was bearish. People were calling for 10k Bitcoin.

Now, I would go as far as to claiming that this sub is slowly warming up to the bullish case (even though engagement is the sub is still very low).

Who knows what will happen to the $-peg of USDT, however, be aware of what is going on around you. No matter what the sentiment is, you're biased. Don't miss out on opportunities, and don't let greed get the best of you, just because other people feel a certain way.

Good luck to you all, and stay eager to expand your horizon.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Is USDT Solid or a Collapse Waiting to Happen?,"I'd like to believe USDT, the largest stablecoin by market cap, has sufficient reserves, but we just don't know. At roughly $83 billion in value, they're supposed to have an equal amount in other assets. Though they've repeatedly claimed to hold adequate reserves, no audit has ever been done to prove this assertion. On their website ([https://tether.to/en/transparency/#usdt](https://tether.to/en/transparency/#usdt)) they allegedly have $86 billion in USD, EUR, and other currencies, creating an over $3 billion ""Shareholder Capital Cushion."" But there are red flags.

1. Tether has never released an audit. The closest they came was hiring Friedman LLP to analyze their books, but they quit before they were finished.
2. Tether has been repeatedly fined by the SEC and the CFTC. While I'm no fan of the SEC at the moment, they have a legitimate beef with them. Tether has been caught outright lying or misleading the public. 
3. The founders are under investigation for bank fraud. The US DOJ is investigating a scheme to mislead banks about the source of their funds and to whom the funds are being moved to.
4. CEO Jan Ludovicus van der Velde seems to be a ghost. Information about him is difficult to find besides his LinkedIn profile, and his presence as the head of Tether is only felt second-hand. 

I hope I'm wrong and that Tether is solid. But it seems a bit fishy. If I'm right and it's just smoke and mirrors, then the crypto-verse is in for perhaps its nastiest shock yet. Thought? ",31,2023-09-09 18:18:51,178

As the days went by, I started seeing it climb, 1$, 2$, 5$, 10$, 30$, and I was thinking... Imagine if I can take this money out. Of course I knew that I wouldn't ever take the money out, I was fully convinced of that, but it was fun to see it happen.

Couple of days later, I go to check the SQUID price and it's at 2000$. I was like wtf? 2000$ times 661 SQUID is 1.3 million dollars. I was a crypto millionaire.

5 minutes later it crashed down to nothing, but the 10$ wasn't for nothing.

I'm now able to say I was a crypto millionaire at some point of my life.

**REMINDER: Don't ever put money on scam coins, always do your research and be careful on what you invest. I was fully aware of this scam.**

EDIT: A lot of people been asking why didn't I sell at 1$ or 20$ or 100$. The reason I didn't sell it was because I couldn't sell. The liquidity pool was closed by the devs since the beginning, meaning that NO ONE could sell/swap their tokens for BNB or USDT or anything else. If I was able to sell I would have sold at 1$!

USDT,cryptocurrency,More than 80% of BTC and ETH trades are done using USDT. So the fall of Tether could prove catastrophic for the market,"No company should have this much power in the market.  

We see it all the time.  Exchanges like Binance and Coinbase forcing USDT down our throats.

  We all know at this point that there are some under-the-table deals between Tether and these exchanges.

  I mean, why would they force us to use a coin that mints coins out of thin air?  When there are much better coins with a 1: 1 gatio like USDS and EURST or others like UST that are backed by a coin with actual value (Luna) ... just seems fishy to me.",124,2021-12-28 07:44:37,323
USDT,cryptocurrency,scammer sent me a seed phrase with $1k usdt (trc20),"I got curious and took a look. I can see how the scam works but it looks like they're still taking a risk. 

It requires 17 tron to withdraw the usdt (trc20) balance, and I can see that they clearly have a bot that automatically withdraws the tron balance before it can be used to transfer out the usdt.

But how can they be so confident that someone else wouldn't make a bot to do this faster? Not to mention it doesn't seem very lucrative. They're only making about $1 per person they scammed. 

I suspect it's against the rules to give out the seed phrase here, but it's a scam anyways. Just curious how they can be so confident that someone won't build a faster bot.

USDT,cryptocurrency,What would happen if the US decides to go after Tether (USDT)?,"Tether, with their largest asset class being USDT, is in my humble opinion, a very likely target for the SEC.

The SEC is going after securities. A security, by definition, is: ""**a certificate or other financial instrument that has monetary value and can be traded"".**

I believe that USDT would fall under this category perfectly, considering it is a Stablecoins. Other Stablecoins have already been referenced as securities by the SEC.

&#x200B;

What would happen if USDT is attacked:

* A crypto crash. With a market cap of over 83 BILLION USD, an attack on Tether could spell doom on the entire crypto industry
* USDT would likely de-peg due to a large selling volume
* We would probably shift to more algorithmic Stablecoins (UST flashbacks), as they are not controlled by a central entity

&#x200B;

Why this might actually be likely:

* The SEC has proven itself to not be scared of going against large crypto organization
* Other Stablecoins have been referenced as securities
* USDT is the largest one, so might be used to set as an example
* The disruption of attacking USDT could be enough of an effect to satisfy the SEC

USDT,cryptocurrency,"Binance.US is not doing well at all right now, USDT was depegging at $0.92 and BTC was trading at $27.7k suddenly.","For quite a lot of time many of us would have thought that empire that CZ build over the years and established as by far the No.1 Crypto Exchange worldwide is invincible, guess we were wrong. Or at least we can start to question it now, as the subsidy and US unit of Binance, Binance.US is facing some real troubles right now. Even since the sEC targeted them and Binance had to limit nearly all of their services there, something very sinister is happening.

Apart from the fact that they lost a bunch of their market share in the US to Coinbase and even Kraken, it is probably the first time that Binance is actually getting near some competition in any country. But even worse:

As we can see here, the USDT has just depegged recently to $0.92, something that only happened on Binance.US and even Bitcoin has been trading at a premium on Binance.US for quite a while now. While worldwide BTC prices were above $30k, on Binance.US they were just $27.7k. Which is a quite big difference.

This makes us all realise that truly no one is “too big to fail“ as this bear market has shown us numerous times already in this bear market and even the once invincible-thought empire of CZ falls under this category.

USDT,cryptocurrency,"For the newcomers: the top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence.","I tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.

11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.

21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that

32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.

47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography.

USDT,cryptocurrency,"Binance Moved $2.7 Billion Out Of 'Proof Of Reserves' Wallet Less Than 24 Hours After Publishing Proof of Reserves, Additional Funds Also 'Missing'","Binance(through CZ) was the company that said that users should get their funds off exchanges. They claimed customer assets are fully backed on Binance.  They said you shouldn't trust (other) exchanges and championed proof of reserves. Then they published their proof of reserves *article* on 10th November at about UTC 13:00:00 or 1PM UTC (the actual snapshot taken earlier obviously) . But **only 20 hours** after publishing, Binance moved 2.7 Billion USDT to another wallet. This wallet is not disclosed or tagged as a Binance wallet and not present in their ""Proof of Reserves"" publishing. 

&#x200B;

Then **only just yesterday**, 200 Million tokens were transferred back into a disclosed Binance wallet leaving around 2.5 Billion Tether left in the new undisclosed strange wallet.

There are also some additional funds missing from other wallets in their proof of reserves snapshot. The second Tron Binance wallet is missing around 2.4 Billion and the third is missing 500 Million(screenshots in Appendix). The bulk of these funds seem to have went missing on the 14th Nov.

. 

In the case of the second and third wallets, at least these funds *might* be explained by users actually withdrawing although this can be up for debate. Even then, there's no way to explain an exchange simple shifting billions in funds into some brand new undisclosed wallet in the case of the first wallet. And they did this **only 20 hours** after publishing their 'proof' of reserves snapshot. 

Sure, companies have the right to manage and store their funds in whatever way they like. They aren't bound to keep it in any particular wallet. But that begs the question, why not just disclose their new wallet with a simple addition to their published proof of reserves statement. Why not properly organize and manage their funds so that they wouldn't look shady making such transactions after  the fact(of publishing reserves). Why not even post something as basic as tweet to provide transparency to users in all of the chaos we are experiencing now as the CEO tweets about things of much less significance. They should know trust in the space is at an all time low.  But instead, users like me have to dig through tons of data to figure out something they could have easily disclosed. Shady as heck. Whether this is funny business they are engaged in or just management incompetence, either way it is not good at all.

USDT,cryptocurrency,"If you support crypto, please read.","I know many of us disagree on many things. We all have our favorite pet projects and argue about everything from proof of work versus proof of stake, to store of value versus medium of exchange. Some of us are into defi, for others its NFTs; maybe it's meme tokens that float your boat, or just plain old electronic cash.

But I like to believe we also all share something in common. We believe in the power of crypto. We believe in what it represents and what it can one day make possible. But it's not just going to happen on its own. The future isn't going to be handed to us on a silver platter and it's going to take as many of us as possible to fight the powers that be and make our voices heard.

I'm not proposing we take down the fed tomorrow, but what I am talking about is something much smaller, something I'm hoping you can help me set right.

The other day I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qyb6zt/an_open_letter_to_johnny_lyu_and_kucoin_exchange/) about the exchange Kucoin. I explained how they've been holding \~$50K of my BCHA (aka XEC on every other exchange) for over six months without letting me withdraw. I shared emails showing how they've given me nothing but the runaround since May, and how Kucoin themselves had [announced](https://www.kucoin.com/news/en-kucoin-will-support-bcha-upgrade-0820) their support of this project 3 months ago, causing me and others to buy even more.

[People's exchange my ass.](https://preview.redd.it/qwcsz21p09181.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=85286d659c2edec9267f65c9b0496e13e328e285)

But they've failed to live up to their word.

While I was thankful to see so many kind and supportive comments, giving me hope for the crypto community at large, I'm sorry to say Kucoin still has yet to tell me when I'll be able to withdraw my coins.

To those who suggested I just sell my BCHA and withdraw in USDT, the fact is I can't because there is no liquidity left. Who wants to buy a coin on an exchange if you can't withdraw, and I hold enough coins that I would have to sell for cents on the dollar if I did. Not to mention I'd just be passing off the problem to some other poor soul.

But what's most important is that I shouldn't have to do any of that. And giving up would just be letting Kucoin off the hook, which I'm not about to do.

So I'm asking for help from the wider cryptocurrency community. I want to believe that people in this community, more than any other, understand the difference between right and wrong and believe in a sense of justice in this world.

I'm asking you to help me right this wrong, and share this post with as many people as possible. My goal is to reach the top of this subreddit and send a loud message to u/Johnny_Kucoin (Johnny Lyu, CEO of Kucoin) that his exchange can't get away with this.

At this point I know that \~$50K of my money is probably gone, but I want everyone in crypto to hear about this so they understand the type of exchange Kucoin is. Because if they can steal my money, there's nothing stopping them from doing the same to you.

I for one am tired of industry players who give crypto a bad name. It's time to call out bad actors and send a message to these companies that they must treat their customers right or we'll simply move our business elsewhere.

I know this is a longshot, but I'm asking you to spread the word, because I am confident that this space is full of amazing people who believe in supporting each other and holding bad actors accountable.

I'm not a vindictive person. I don't want Kucoin to go out of business. I just want them to do the right thing and make sure others aren't cheated out of their money like I was.

Today the sentiment here was of death... in a few a minutes a lot of buying orders and BTC pumped 2k up and alts followed. Do you think this is organic?

Of course not! Whales are playing with the market and will continue to do so and take money off from retail, specially when you buy at the top and panic sell

Other way to lose larges amount of money to whales is leveraging. A lot of shorts got blasted in the last 2 hours

Just check Whale Alert twitter, there are millions and billions of dollar moving from just a few wallets.

Even if everyone in this sub chipped in with 10 USD$, it wouldn't even come close to whales' power. See this transactions just a few hours ago: "" 129,921,132 USDT (129,921,132 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to BINANCE "". That's over 30 USD for each one here! And that's just one Whale

TLDR: That's it boys and girls, you're a mere shrimp or algae in this crypto ocean, and the only real tool you have at your disposal is playing long term and not panic buy/sell, all the rest is playing with your luck and chances are you are going to get crushed by the whales",5720,2021-11-28 21:51:05,1498

There has been so many cases of lives being ruined by gambling and if the bank want to advise us about something, they should advise us about not gambling instead of investing crypto..

In the end, I do understand their point. They are probably scared shaking about crypto’s threat to their banking system.",6811,2021-09-19 18:15:38,1120

USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether has not reported its supply for 3 days now. Its supply has also fell 8B in the 5 days before that.,"Tether is usually reports its supply on their official website once every day, at an inconsistent time. That's why you can see stairs like this on a market cap chart:

[Tether market cap in the past 7 days - not counting the depeg it's the same as the supply](https://preview.redd.it/dymvdlxi03091.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&s=098410d180c50328cbe0103ebc98317c3d72f917)

If you go to their website you can see their current circulating supply with the same latency:

[The last update date is not true - it's actually May 14 and the supply exactly the same as it was 3 days ago](https://preview.redd.it/1vtvjvqez2091.png?width=1298&format=png&auto=webp&s=390553ce99b2cdb44d12eb745cf9b3505c77c9aa)

So they're not only not reporting the supply, but they're also lying about updating it. The only reason why would they do that is because their supply fell significantly in these 3 days and they don't want more people to follow. If they didn't hide the 8B that dropped during 5 days, how much are they hiding from these 3 days?

Tether is getting more and more shady with everyday. They will probably try to buy back some of the withdrawn Tether with their reserves, decreasing their actual reserves and shooting themselves in the foot further. Of course Tether collapsing is not a good thing, many people will lose their money and a crypto crash will follow. Under any circumstances, don't hold Tether.",4110,2022-05-17 18:46:26,1180

If you go onto the XRP/USDT pairing on LAToken and scroll back to the 23rd February you can see the price dropped to 0.00004USDT per XRP. I had placed very low limit orders prior to this that have since been filled.

When I logged into my account after placing these low bids on the market a while back, I was amazed to see I had amassed 632,151 XRP tokens.

Here’s the heart-breaking bit. I naturally was mind-blown, so I tried to sell some of the XRP in the account then withdraw my profits from the exchange elsewhere, only to have the withdrawal declined and my account temporarily closed for 1 day siting a ‘violation of our terms of use’. I have done nothing wrong and simply set low limit orders that were filled.

I contacted support asking why this has happened, they didn’t tell me why my account was restricted or what terms of use I had broken. After the 24 hours my account is back up, all the XRP is gone and I’m left with the cryptocurrency I had originally. I contact support again asking for my coins back, I get vague responses not related to the issue.

USDT,cryptocurrency,"Moonshots - I analyzed 3,000+ crypto's over the last 8 years to see if and how you should try to find moonshots : Here are the results.","All of us have at least once wished we had made a similar play to the one that [turned $17 into \~6M](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/05/21076574/he-invested-17-in-shiba-inu-now-he-has-almost-6m) or had gotten into the [right crypto at the right time.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/millennial-dogecoin-millionaire-on-being-paid-in-dogecoin.html) It’s not like we are alone in this thought process - there are more than 1.7 million people right now trying to find the [next crypto moonshot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/). For those who are out of the loop, a moonshot is something that has a low probability of becoming extremely successful \[1\].

While it’s definitely nice to be the guy who made the correct play, what I wanted to understand is, how likely are you to pick the next big coin? After all, there are more than [2,400 dead coins](https://www.coinopsy.com/dead-coins/#other) that were part of someone’s moonshot not that long back. When a coin is dead, we would end up losing almost 100% of the capital that we invested in it thereby breaking the cardinal rule of investing.

>*Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1 -* ***Warren Buffet***

While Warren Buffet might not be the best example for the crypto world, his advice holds true just as well in all investing spaces - Once you lose your capital, it’s game over. So in this deep-dive, let's see how the less popular cryptos have performed over the years, whether it makes sense to invest in them, and finally, would you have made better returns just by investing in the top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum?!

### Data & Analysis Methodology

All the data used in the analysis has been collected from coinmarketcap.com. Their data is available going as far back as 2014. I collected the price, market cap, and the symbol for all the coins listed in coinmarketcap on Jan 1st of every year from 2014 to 2022. There were only 67 listed coins in 2014. The list has grown to more than 3,000+ as of Jan 2022. All the data and my analysis are shared as a Rows sheet at the end.

The analysis is fairly simple and I have intentionally made the strategy straightforward so that it’s easy to replicate. We will be comparing the performance of the Top 10 Cryptocurrencies with the next 90 based on the total market cap of the coin.

[The end of 2017 was definitely some wild time to be in the Crypto space.](https://preview.redd.it/ie9owd9mylv81.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=4830cb8e014e559cb2754b8f514a90a7f1787ac1)

I have limited the analysis to the top 100 coins because of two reasons

1. Even now, close to 95% of the combined market cap of the crypto market is contributed by just the top 100 coins. Adding to this, it becomes more and more difficult/riskier \[2\] to invest in coins having low market cap due to platform and liquidity issues.
2. There are hundreds of new coins that are being launched every day. It’s almost impossible to keep track of all the coins and realistically do proper due diligence before investing. So for practical feasibility, I am limiting it to the top 100.

### Results

Before we jump straight into the return calculation, it’s interesting to see how the crypto market has changed over the years.

https://preview.redd.it/m0fng8moylv81.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=98fb3edb350696ab03e9136c7b2eaf3ab9f46336

In the first few years where crypto was becoming mainstream (2014 to 2017), the top 10 currencies dominated the overall market cap contributing close to 99% \[3\]. Also, during crashes, we can observe a massive shift in capital allocation from Altcoin to Bitcoin → 2017 was one of the best bull runs (barring 2021) where we can see that Bitcoin only contributed to \~39% of the market cap. But once the bear market set in (2018-19), the allocation to bitcoin proportionally increased until the 2021 bull run.

#### Creating a Crypto Index

To answer our initial question → Whether it’s better to invest in the top 10 most popular cryptos or the other 90 relatively lesser-known ones, we will be creating an equal-weighted index \[4\].

We have two people Alan and Charlie who want to get into the crypto market in 2014, but both are following a slightly different approach.

Alan will invest only in the top 10 most popular currencies. Every new year, he will go and check the top 10 cryptos by Market Cap and then equally invest between the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Charlie, on the other hand, will do the exact same thing with the only difference being that instead of the top 10, he will invest in the 90 next biggest cryptocurrencies.

They continue to do this over the next 8 years and now it’s 2022 and it’s time to see who has performed better.

[Returns shown here are till Jan 1st, 2022](https://preview.redd.it/5u10wctsylv81.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=aacb02399d50dbd1d1874aba631a97dc354dbaab)

Would you look at that! Alan who has invested in only the top-10 cryptos did vastly better than Charlie who went for the riskier play of investing in the not so well known currencies. The top 10 cryptos on average performed 5x better than the next 90 and 2x better than just investing in Bitcoin. What’s even more interesting is that Charlie would have done 2x better just putting his money in Bitcoin - Ouch!

#### Survival

If you are wondering why Charlie is getting the lowest return in spite of taking the most risk\[5\], it’s because you are forgetting Rule 1 of investing - To not lose your initial investment.

https://preview.redd.it/mmntwr9vylv81.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c69754b5cbf65bc865d87a11ea5116baf9f5a70

The probability of survival of a coin is extremely skewed towards the top 10 currencies. As you can see, over 80% of the top 10 coins from 2014 are still in existence today compared to only 26% of the rest. This trend keeps repeating over the years and your capital would have been decimated. Once it goes to zero, there is no way for it to come back up as any gain on $0 is still 0!

#### Moonshots

Finally, we come to what we are all here for! What are our chances of actually hitting a moonshot following this strategy?

[I have defined a 100x return as a Moonshot](https://preview.redd.it/j8oiifewylv81.png?width=404&format=png&auto=webp&s=fec161da3968b773bb1f96eca3da9c114da48cd9)

Well, your chances of hitting a moonshot are also much higher following the top-10 strategy. Overall, you had a 1 in 10 chance of getting a 10,000% return compared to the 1 in 30 chance of the riskier next-90 strategy.

The above chart also shows another interesting stat → Out of the 500+ cryptos that we analyzed, less than 4% of them ended up becoming a moonshot. Think about that for a min - Of all the cryptos you are likely to hear about (*as there is very less coverage if it’s not in the top 100*), only 3-4% of them end up giving you those insane returns. You have similar chances betting on a single number on the Roulette wheel.

https://preview.redd.it/23hva9qyylv81.png?width=391&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bf4c72e5515d1c77faa01aa82b29eaf590c6289

As you can see, of all our moonshots, Ethereum investment in 2016 ended up returning the most at a whopping 397,548%!

### Limitations

It’s important to understand the limitations of the current analysis before trying to replicate it.

1. **Data** \- As I discussed earlier, all the data is from coinmarketcap and I have assumed a coin is dead if it’s not listed in the following year’s data. This analysis is only as strong as the quality of input data \[6\]. I have done extensive QCs but feel free to play around with the raw data to see if I missed something.
2. **Base Effect** \- The market is considerably different now than it was in 2015-17. There is more awareness as well as penetration. So the future growth might not be as explosive as the one that we observed in the past decade, so you should be realistic about your return potential
3. **Intra Year Returns** \- The current analysis only considers returns based on Jan 1st of every year starting from 2014. If we pick another date within the year, we might get slightly different results as there might have been ATHs and ATLs within the year which we are not capturing.

### Conclusion

>*It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong — George Soros*

I started the analysis thinking that investing in the not-so-popular currencies is bound to give better returns as it’s more likely they are undervalued due to lower publicity and hype associated with them.

But, as we saw from the data, in the case of crypto it’s much more profitable just to invest in the top currencies. It’s like the case where being in the game is much more important than trying to hit it big and striking out!

According to Protos, 81% of this was issued between October 2020 –  October 2021. This corresponds to a period of rapid growth in Tether’s  market cap from $15 billion to $71 billion.

 

Tether’s market cap grew massively over 2021, the same period that Alameda received \~80% of its USDT It is possible that some of the USDT Alameda received were later redeemed for real dollars, meaning the net dollar amount sent to Tether by Alameda could be less than $36 billion.

We now  know that SBF and his companies were outright frauds who stole customer  deposits to finance their activities. Theoretically, we could attribute  some of the Tether issuance to stolen funds, but this would not come  anywhere close to $36 billion.

 And Tether is still ""okay"" after this.",103,2022-12-03 01:07:05,122

USDT,cryptocurrency,What Is Keeping USDT Pegged To The USD? Breaking Down Tether Reserves,"USDT is one of the most popular stablecoins in the space and it's one of the most used pairs to trade cryptocurrencies. This stablecoin aims to be always pegged 1:1 to the USD. For it to be always worth the same as the USD, the company behind it has to have reserves that match the current supply of USDT circulating.

So what are the Tether reserves?

According to Tether and their independent audit, Tether holds 85,05% of their USDT supply in cash or cash equivalents, 0,13% in corporate bonds, 3,78% in precious metals, 1,94% in Bitcoin, 6,36% in secured loans and 2,73% in other investments. 

The biggest part of this cake can be divided in several different things, cash and cash equivalents can mean many things so lets break it down. Inside the 85,05% of the cash and cash equivalents, 75,86% are U.S Treasury Bills, 12,09% are overnight reverse repurchase agreements, 0,78% are term reverse repurchase agreements, 11,06% are money market funds, 0,12% are cash and bank deposits and 0,09% are non-US Treasury Bills.

All these numbers mean that effectively, real cash is a really small percentage of Tether's holdings. The major holdings according to Tether are U.S Treasury Bills and there's more investments in the middle of this that are not known exactly what they are.

As we know, it only takes a small decline in the reserves to deppeg a stablecoin, supposedly reserves have to be atleast valued at the same as USDT supply. When this audit was made, in the 30th of June, Tether had 67 billion dollars in assets and 66 billion dollars in liabilities, meaning that the reserves had 1 billion dollars more in value than the supply.

Looking at the supply of USDT now, we will find that there are more than 83 billion USDT circulating, meaning that Tether would have to add almost 30 billion dollars to their reserves. Here is where the questions start, does Tether hold 83 billion in reserves right now? Does Tether always hold the same amount of reserves as they have in USDT supply or do they only hold it when an audit is comming.

This is the uncertain that keeps some users worried about Tether, if they don't always hold they reserves accordingly, it only takes something happening like a leak for USDT to come down in a spiral and crash the entire market.

USDT is an important part of the market, even if it's disliked so much. Tether should make more efforts to keep users assured that they are doing things right. Their reputation in the crypto ecosystem is bad and they are accused of all kind of things, one of them being market manipulation.

Will USDT ever be as transparent as they should and finally assure users that they are completely legit and not an house of cards waiting to fall?",23,2023-10-03 20:33:15,90
USDT,cryptocurrency,The fact that USDT market cap is shrinking is a good thing because it means that redemptions are working.,"I see alot of people here losing their hair over the fact that the market cap of USDT is shrinking, when in reality the fact that the market cap is going down while the peg is being maintained and the curve 3pool is at healthy rates is actually a good thing.

This is because the only way for the market cap of USDT to go down is if users are able to redeem their USDT to tether in return for actual dollars. 

One of the biggest fears regarding tether (at least in the early days) was that there wasnt a clear process by which an individual investor could redeem tether back into dollars. This latest activity shows that it is possible and happening.

Also, the contraction of USDT market cap stabilizes the LP balances in the curve pool and on CEXes which makes depegging actually considerably less likely.",148,2022-05-16 04:33:22,128

Then after the collapse of UST someone had to take over the market share of it. USDC and USDT were the frontrunners, but later on we also had BUSD entering it as Binance wanted their share of the pie.

Now at the end of it, BUSD and USDC are being targeted by the regulators, while USDT has sneaked it‘s way out as the Kind of Stablecoins you would say.

Now it is picking up steam again, USDT has just reached an All-time high circulating supply, which was recently reached in early 2022. This just shows that after a year long bear market Tether is back at it‘s old glory and it also shows how the Crypto Market is getting back to those levels, as the supply of Tether has always been very correlated with the Crypto Market.

But it obviously also shows how after all of the doom and gloom of 2022, USDT is still able to put on the printer with still no real Proof of Reserves, so basically from the perspective of our normal investor they are printing our of thin air.",36,2023-05-10 17:19:46,106
USDT,cryptocurrency,Finally did it: I made a crypto trading bot that automatically places orders on new listings before they get added on Binance or Kucoin,"So I've been working on this project for over 6 months now, and I've learned quite a bit about how new listings behave, and how important the Binance and Kucoin Annoucement pages are.

My initial idea was to create a crypto trading bot in Python, that constantly checks if a new listing is added on Binance, essentially by checking the total number of coins at any given time. I tried out different variations on this, end even increased the speed to buy within 0.1 seconds on a new coin being listed.

After looking at the results, and talking to some of you on here, it turns out that the spike in the price upon listing the coin is actually the peak of the iceberg.

The real activity seems to happen once big exchanges announce that they will list the coin, and not upon the listing itself.

Have a look at the chart for FIDA/USDT below, and the time Binance made the announcement:

[FIDAUSDT](https://preview.redd.it/i42z3i9dxa981.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3bacc1b823f19c9c4f447e31678ebd6c639c648)

Looks like people are fomoing hard into new coins on different exchanges in anticipation of a Binance pump, ironically creating the pump themselves.

So with that in mind, I built a crypto trading algorithm that listens to the Binance announcement page, and once there is an announcement for a new coin listing, the bot extracts the symbol of that coin and places a Buy order on Gate .io.

The tool will automatically place buy and sell orders and it has a trailing stop loss feature, meaning that it should sell at the optimum time, in theory.

I chose gate .io because according to what I've seen and what some of you have said, this exchange seem to list many of the coins that later make it on Binance or other bigger exchanges.

The tool is free to use for everyone, but I suggest running it in Test mode at first, as I still need to confirm that everything runs fine. Annoyingly, gate .io doesn't have a testnet which means I had to test the buy/sell logic by placing real trades - not ideal.

But I've included a test mode for the tool itself, so it won't actually call the gate .io API, it will just simulate the trades locally.

The tool has been tested by me along with a bunch of other people for a while now. I can say that it definitely has potential, and has made profit on numerous occasions, however it is not perfect. Or rather - it can be improved further.

One of the issues we've been having is the speed at which the bot will buy the announcement. As you might expect, this needs to happen really fast in order to take advantage of the pump (under 5 seconds in most cases).

It seems that the speed of the bot varies from one listing to another, making consistent profits a bit tricky - but not impossible.

USDT,cryptocurrency,UST (a stable coin) is currently down 14%. This is a bigger drop than BTC and most other the top altcoins. A warning about echo chambers.,"I posted only a couple of [days ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ukv56a/terra_luna_has_dropped_almost_three_times_as_much/) warning everyone this was pretty much on the cards. I obviously don’t want to see anyone or anything fail, but it really is important to read everything with an open heart. 

If you straight up ignore all advice that is contrary to what you want to hear, you are setting yourself up for failure. The Safemoon sub is the prime example of the echo chamber that just won’t listen. 

Please. If someone warns you against something, try to find reason in it. Is it possible they are correct? Challenge it, and ask or clarify your misunderstandings. 

I don’t want this post to come across as a “told you so” at all. Although I’m sure many commenters will say exactly that. The point I’m trying to make is to please listen to both sides at all times. It is usually quite easy to discern between someone just spreading FUD and someone who is trying to challenge the merits of a project. 

One thing I do to help me understand all issues is to join the subs or projects I’m not involved in, as well as those I am involved in. I need to hear all sides.",3265,2022-05-09 23:34:54,966

USDT,cryptocurrency,"I started investing my dad’s money while he knows nothing about crypto, here’s a funny thing that happened.","First of all, My dad asked me to invest some of his money into crypto, as I know a bit about it and I’m doing relatively well. He knows nothing about crypto, but trusts me and acknowledges the volatility. I, in no way, persuaded him to invest in crypto.
Having said that, here’s what happened;

I downloaded a portfolio app on his phone so that he can track the crypto I bought and also so he keeps up with what I’m doing with his money. Naturally, I keep plenty of funds in a stablecoin (in this case usdt) so that I can buy potential dips.
One afternoon I kept getting calls from him on my workphone (he never calls me on my workphone). Flustered, I picked up the phone during an important meeting, fearing something bad had happened. When I picked up he said the most boomer thing I ever heard him say ‘Hey, I have been tracking this coin usdt you bought, and it is not doing much, it’s not fluctuating at all, but I’m really, really expecting a rise soon, what do you think?!’

I found it absolutely adorable and dumb at the same time. I explained everything to him and we had a good laugh about it. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share this giggle I had. Hope it also brings you some joy in these trying times.

EDIT: Wow, this post really exploded. Thanks for all the awards and love kind strangers. I see there is some controversy about the whole 'Tether' thing. I appreciate you guys looking out for me and my father. I truly do. Having said that, I don't feel the need to fuel this discussion. I think everyone is entitled to his own crypto choices and my dad trusts me enough to make those choices for him. It was not the intention of this post to start a tether-riot. It was simply meant to share a funny crypto-related story. Oh, and for the people saying this is a repost. I did try to post this about a month ago I think, but it got instantly deleted by the mods because I didn't have the required Comment Karma to post on this subreddit. I just thought I'd try to share my story again now having the required Karma. Anyway, I hope all of you have a wonderful crypto-journey. I'm still reading all the comments. It truly makes my day!

This is the boat I believe ADA is in. It isn't all just about the tech. Smart contracts are currently not as big in the world to the point where superior tech makes that big of a difference (hence why all the other ""Ethereum killers failed"" even with better tech). Ethereum has such a huge network effect as well as first-mover advantage where I can't see it getting flipped any time soon, especially with EIP 1559 coming out in July and ETH 2.0 being fully released (within a year?). At this point, most people/whales that are buying ETH are not in it for the tech but for what it is - the second most valued crypto (and generally more stable than the altcoins).

So Kraken support just told me that:

USDT,cryptocurrency,"After 13 years of Crypto, most of the market is still full of shit","Now that we've had the latest face-melting event, and the crypto marketcap as a whole has plummeted from \`\`$3 trillion to $1.25 trillion, I thought it would be worthwhile to survey the landscape a bit and see where things stand. 

Of the $1.25 trillion market cap, Bitcoin dominance is at 44.8%, Ethereum is at 19.3%, and when you account for (still) functioning stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD, DAI) that makes up another 12%. All together, those 3 things make up 76% of the entire crypto marketcap. 

Of the remaining 24%, some of the coins that still manage to crack the top 30  include Doge, Shib, XRP, UST (lol), BCH, and ETC.

So what is the takeaway here? After all of this time, the vast majority of the value created in this space has flown into just 2 assets, and 99% of the rest are pretty much dogshit.   


I've been in the markets since 2017, which hardly makes a hardened crypto alumni, yes somehow still seems to make me older than 95% of this sub, so here is a look back in time for those ""new"" here...

I hate when people make these things absurdly long without getting to the point...so here it is....the number of projects we've seen come and go, projects that at one time were the darlings of this sub, is honestly laughable. Luna is one more casualty in a long, long list of examples. 

The fact is that 99% of crypto investors that have made any sort of real and consistent money over the years have done so by regularly buying Bitcoin and Ethereum, as they can afford to, and then just holding. 

It is so fucking simple guys, and most of you know this to be true. But every damn year there are some new toys to lose your life savings with, and people fall for it hook, line, and sinker every time. 

If the 200% CAGRs of BTC and ETH aren't good enough for you, and you need to dump everything you've got into fucking Willy Wonka coin or something, then godspeed and good luck.

But for those that are here to invest towards a better financial future for yourself and your family, and have the patience and temperance to do it, the writing is clearly on the wall for all of you to read.

But before this, we had many other cases of incidents where lot of people losted money, in all of them because human greed, scammers, malpractices and other reasons where always is human wrongdoing that ends up affecting us all.

Have you been affected by any of these cases? In how many, in which ones?

&#x200B;

In my case i swapped some USDC to UST 2 months before the Luna meltdown, and when things started to fall apart i swapped back to USDC and losted near 1.x%, if i take the 2 months farming i didnt got hit, and i got that luna airdrop that still goes monthly a little bit of it. On the other big cases of FTX or Voyager or other exchanges i didnt got hit, but i have a good friend that losted a big amount, near 30% of his portfolio, and you can hear stories all the time. Now with the USDC drama we are living i swapped all my USDC to USDT on Friday, losing very little like 0.1% becase i was fast at seeing what was going on. But majority of people werent on twitter checking the live news...

I feel that in most of the cases you have some hours before things go crazy, in some cases even more time. For example FTX had 10 days since the Coindesk article hit to their meltdown, but in those 10 days most of the people were thinking ah FTX its too big, it wont fall down, but then it did.

Time matters in getting out, and it feels stressing that you need to stay vigilant every day so your money dont disapear :/

I remember the day when tether lost its peg nearly 5 years ago. They still recovered... This is not financial advice, but whether or not we can and will see USDC recover, well that's a different story. I sincerely hope they do recover because they seems to have a more ""legit"" business story and background than tether.

It amazes me how many people have shown up in this thread that just say ""oH bUt UsT wAs A sTaBlEcOiN aNd It WeNt To ZeRo."" without understanding backing by assets. USDC is -supposedly- pegged 1 to 1 on the USD. Tether is backed by a mix of cash reserves (at 70% of market cap) and paper investments.

USDT,cryptocurrency,"A Balanced Portfolio Should Consist of at least 70% BTC, 60% ETH, 30% top 15 alts, 20% stables, and 10% low cap","I’ve been seeing a lot of people post about adding BTC and ETH to their portfolio and asking questions how they should split up their portfolio. In this thread, I will share my experience on the perfect breakdown. 

To start, you want at least 70% in BTC. This is the granddaddy of all coins and your most stable. The higher the percentage of BTC, the better.

Next is ETH, I’ve found 60% is a good level. Even if you just have BTC and ETH, you will have 130% of your portfolio in 2 coins, up for 100% you started with. To instantly have 30% more, you are genius. 

Next up is the large-cap alts. I like 30% here. You can LRDYOR (let Redditors do your own research) to decide which coin is best for you, but possible examples are SOL, ADA, DOT, LINK, AVAX, etc. Following advice up to this point, you have at least 160% portfolio. 

Keeping 20% stables is key to any portfolio. You can earn interest (up to 20%) on stables, plus any price action. I saw one tik-tok’er predict Tether would go to $5 this year. I think that’s bullish, but I can easily see USDT going to $3. Let’s say you earn 20% interest on your 20% investment, you now have 40% (compounding interest works wonders). Now your portfolio allocation is at 200% and you have doubled your money. 

Now that you have doubled your money, going for 100% portfolio allocation to 200%, you have freedom to gamble on low cap coins. I’d keep this to 10%. 

This strategy will work for everyone. It will instantly turn you into a billionaire overnight. Follow me for more financial advice.",2594,2022-03-02 12:21:05,959

Whale ""0xd275"" started to borrow USDC from Aave and Compound and bought USDT for arbitrage after CZSamSun shorted USDT. This address could very will be owned by Tether. USDT started back to the peg.

Does wallet ""0xd275"" belong to Tether? It withdrew 50K ETH ($81.8M) from Bifinex 2 hrs ago and deposited to Compound. Then borrowed 59M USDC from Compound to buy USDT and tried to get USDT back to the peg.

Imagine if USDT saw a sudden massive amount of withdrawals. Tether could change the fee that is set to 0, to disincentive anyone to transfer their USDT.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Binance US is halting all USD business and going CRYPTO ONLY.,"Get your fiat off the exchange :/

 

""As you may be aware, Binance.US, alongside other companies in our industry, has become the target of aggressive tactics by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has brought unjustified civil claims against our business, from which we will continue to vigorously defend ourselves, our customers, our partners and industry. 

Irrespective of the baseless claims, and in light of the Commission’s increasingly aggressive tactics, our payment and banking partners have signaled their intent to **pause USD fiat channels as early as June 13, 2023,** meaning our ability to accept USD fiat deposits and process USD fiat withdrawals will be impacted. As part of our customer-first commitment, we are notifying users promptly so you can take necessary actions as we transition to a **crypto-only exchange**. To be clear, we maintain 1:1 reserves for all customer assets, so customer funds are always safe, secure, and available. 

Please note the following changes that will impact the platform:

* **ACH WITHDRAWALS: We encourage customers to** **withdraw their USD** **via bank transfer (ACH) by June 13, 2023. Due to elevated volumes and weekend bank closures, ACH withdrawals may take longer than usual to process (e.g. up to several days); we appreciate your patience.**
* USD DEPOSITS: To ensure a timely USD withdrawal process, we are suspending USD deposits and recurring buy orders today and beginning the transition to a crypto-only exchange. Any deposits already initiated will be processed.
* USD TRADING PAIRS: Beginning next week, we will start delisting USD pairs (e.g., BTC-USD) on our platform, while continuing to support stablecoin pairs (e.g., BTC-USDT).
* USD BALANCES: Any USD balances remaining on the platform after June 15, 2023 may be converted to stablecoin that can be withdrawn on-chain. 
* **Cryptocurrency services remain fully operational, including: crypto trading, staking, deposits and withdrawals.**

Until we secure more stable banking partners, Binance.US will remain a crypto-only exchange–at least for a time.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Tether explains how it is able to maintain its peg on their official website. Spoiler alert: They don't explain anything,"Tether's official website released an article named ""How Tether USD₮ Is Able to Maintain Its Peg When Other Stablecoins Fall"". So, there should be a professional explanation about their reserves? Nope.

The entire article is pretty much useless:

>Given the recent losses UST investors suffered, many users may be questioning if they can trust Tether USD₮ given the spectacular collapse of UST.   
>  
>Thankfully, all one needs to do is look at the history and track record of Tether USD₮.   
>  
>Tether USD₮ has been relied on as the primary form of dollar-based liquidity in the crypto market for many years and the crypto market has not been without its share of dramatic crashes! 

Like, what is this? They are saying they should be trusted entirely based on their track record, with no other explanation whatsoever??

&#x200B;

The first half of the page is useless, so what about the second half? 

The second half of the article is titled ""How Does an Algorithmic Stablecoin Work?"" and it's ALL they are talking about. 

>While UST is referred to as a stablecoin, it has nothing in common with collateralized stablecoins like Tether USD₮. UST is an algorithmic stablecoin. 

Again, they are using UST as a scapegoat instead of addressing their reserves or any explanation of how they maintain their peg.

USDT,cryptocurrency,"Bolivia Takes a Bold Step Amid an Economical Crisis: Pioneers Regulated Crypto Custody Service (USDT), Expanding Financial Options for Citizens","In a move that promises to transform the Bolivian financial landscape, Banco Bisa has announced the implementation of an innovative custody service for virtual assets, specifically USDT, that allows clients to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrencies safely and efficiently. Franco Urquidi, Vice President of Business at the financial institution, highlighted that all transactions must be made to and from an account at Banco Bisa, which guarantees a high level of security. 

This new service offers clients the possibility of holding funds in USDT for as long as they wish, making payments abroad and even sending money to relatives studying abroad. “The sky is the limit,” said Urquidi, referring to the future functionalities that the bank plans to offer in this area.

 USDT (Tether) is a cryptocurrency designed to maintain its value at parity with the US dollar. This makes it a “stablecoin” or stable currency, whose value is backed by dollar reserves. The idea is that each USDT in circulation is backed by a dollar in the accounts of Tether Limited, the company that issues this currency, which helps stabilize its price. 

The director of the Financial System Supervision Authority (ASFI), Yvette Espinoza, supported the initiative by pointing out that Banco Bisa is a pioneer in offering this service within a regulatory framework that guarantees the security and confidence of users. ""This is a custody service that will allow clients to carry out various operations safely, reducing the risk of unsafe interactions in the cryptocurrency market,"" said Espinoza.

The vice president of Banco Bisa also emphasized the importance of financial education in the use of virtual assets. To this end, the bank has established strategic alliances with recognized international custody and exchange companies, thus ensuring data protection and the prevention of illicit activities. ""Our clients go through a rigorous verification process, which gives them the peace of mind that their transactions are carried out through safe and reliable channels,"" added Urquidi.

 Furthermore, the cost of this service is affordable. USDT sales start at a minimum of 200 USDT up to a daily limit of 10,000, with fees ranging from 35 to 100 bolivianos, depending on the amount. Transfers to dollar accounts abroad cost Bs 280, representing an attractive option for those looking to use cryptocurrencies for international payments. 

With the recent authorization from ASFI for other financial entities to also offer services related to virtual assets, Banco Bisa is positioned as a leader in innovation in the Bolivian market. The entity is committed to training its users, ensuring that they understand both the benefits and risks associated with handling cryptocurrencies.

In short, Banco Bisa is not only ushering in a new era in the Bolivian financial sector, but is also setting a standard in security and financial education in the use of virtual assets. ""The future looks promising for those looking to explore the world of cryptocurrencies in Bolivia,"" Urquidi highlighted.

[ASFI \(Bolivian Financial Regulator\) director Yvette Espinoza was at the press conference giving her support to the financial institution and stressed that innovation in financial services should be developed in a coordinated manner with the regulator and the Government.](https://preview.redd.it/1surkhlho4xd1.jpg?width=760&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e6c8cb67b8240ac55f38ae92333dfa370010c46)

Here are my findings, with some interesting tidbits:","**Edit: I fucked up and missed a decimal place regarding XLM. That has been corrected.** Thanks, /u/TRossW18. Good catch! That changed things significantly. In thanks, $10 is going to the charity of your choice.

[That post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oq1p0b/coinmarketcap_on_july_23_2017_if_youve_never/) got me to thinking just how many coins completely tanked, so I decided to jump in headfirst and do some research. I apologize in advance for my formatting; I haven't actually tried to type out a legitimately formatted post on reddit in a long time.

First, I am going to show a table of all 100 coins, broken down into sections. The first section will be the Top 10 coins from 4 years ago. Included will be their ticker (their new ticker will be in parentheses, if applicable); the price on July 23, 2017; the current price (the date they ceased to exist in parentheses, if applicable); the percent increase/decrease over the past 4 years; and the ATH price (and date); the percent increase from the snapshot date to ATH (if the ATH was prior to July 23, 2017, it will show a decrease). I will talk about each section a bit before moving on to the next section and, after all the coins are posted, I'll provide some overview and some interesting tidbits.

Note: The Current Price is as of sometime yesterday, as I did my initial research throughout the day. Also, dates are in MMDDYY format. *=Current Top 100, as of the time of my research. Some coins are borderline and may have moved into or out of the current 100 as of this posting.

Out of this group, obviously BTC performed the best, although ETH is right on its heels. Most of the coins here have had solid run-ups overall. Half of them had their ATH reached in 2021 and, assuming the upward trend eventually picks back up and new ATHs are reached, they will likely have a different ATH in the future. 

XRP especially went bananas in early 2018 and, even though it ~~is~~ was centralized, it was one of /r/cryptocurrency's most shilled coins during that holiday period. Out of these 10 coins, only STRAT is unlikely to ever reach it's July 23, 2017 price point in the future. 

The next grouping will be coins 11-25 from 4 years ago. They had robust market caps, especially for the time, all ranging between $250M-$450M. It is really interesting to see the wild swings in this group, as this is where the gambles really start to take place. It is also where we see our first Zero Coin (coin that drops to nothing). I'm sure some of y'all might be able to guess what it is.

$1466.44|$97.76|5|2, almost 3|2|0|6|WAVES

Looking at the coins in this group, I was expecting NEO to have the most profit over time. Seeing WAVES slightly higher was surprising. What wasn't surprising was seeing Bitconnect (BCC) be the first Zero Coin Casualty. As an aside, if you had bought BCC on 07/23/17 and sold the day after Carlos Matos yelled his WASO WASO WASO WASO BITCONNNNNEEEEECCCCCTTTT!!!!! meme, you would have gotten out shortly before it reached an ATH and would have gotten about 5.5x return on your investment. That meme was the moment everyone with a brain realized that BCC was a complete scam and the writing was on the wall for a huge dump forthcoming. 

This group did pretty well, even with the BCC, ICN and BCN duds, but this is where the huge swings can be seen for the first time, with the exception of Tether, the one and only stablecoin in the Top 100 from 4 years ago. An abnormality in this group is EOS with its ATH date of April 2018, a good 3 months after the crash started. Intriguing. Next up are the remainder of the Top 50 from 4 years ago, including the biggest gainer of all (I'm sure you all know what it is already).

Here are the totals for this group of 25:

Total Profit|$/Coin|# Profitable Coins|Zero|2x+|4x+|Current Top 100|Biggest Increase
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
$13,498.67|$498.17|10|2|5|4|5|DOGE (obviously)

One of the most eye-opening stats here is that there were only 2 Zero Coins in the entire group. That equals the number of Zero Coins from the 11-25 group, with 10 extra coins in this grouping. If you were to pick a coin at random from this group on this date in 2017, you would have a 92% chance of choosing a coin that still exists today. That's pretty impressive. 

Two obvious PNDs exist in this group (PAY and BNT), who both had their ATH prior to the date and both were over 90% off their ATH, reached within 4 weeks of the listing. BNT dropped from its ATH of 23.73 down to 2.15 in a matter of 6 days, while PAY dropped from 86.26 to 1.05 in 24 HOURS. That crash is almost as impressive as TITAN's. 

DOGE obviously carried this group with its 9540% increase. Hypothetically, if you were to invest $100 in each of the 100 coins in this list and all of them crashed to 0 except DOGE, which maintained its trajectory, you would have only lost $460 total out of your $10,000. If you were to cash out DOGE at its ATH, that $100 investment alone would have netted you $36,880. XLM also had much, much better gains than I initially calculated. Very impressive, as well.

Also, I was confused by DGD because it increased by 6.8x but is still only 481st in market cap today. DigixDAO is a unique crypto that is directly tied to gold whereby 1 DGD=1 gram of gold. Supposedly. I'd be interested to hear more about it in the comments if any of you have any working knowledge on how it works, since the price swings look similar to most other crypto. 

The next group is the remaining 50 coins. The real gambles. 38 of the remaining 50 at the time had a market cap of <$50M, with one of them being in the Top 50 for only one day, which happened to be the day of the snapshot. Here are the next 50:

Here are the totals for the bottom 50:

Total Profit|$/Coin|# Profitable Coins|Zero|2x+|4x+|Current Top 100|Biggest Increase
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
$3779.42|$75.59|13|6, with 5 others >98% loss|5|3|0|XVG

I found it a bit odd that none of the Top 100 from 4 years ago are currently in the Top 100 now (even though a few are close). There also wasn't nearly as much capitulation as I thought there would be. There are 5 Zero Coins in this group, which is more than the other groups combined (comparing Top 50 to Bottom 50, it was actually close, though). There are a lot of coins with 75% losses, and many that are on the verge of dying completely.

The most fascinating coin to me in this group, and maybe out of the entire research, is COE. It just so happened that this coin debuted on 07/23/17 and was actually off its ATH (or hadn't reached it yet) at the time the Wayback Machine performed its timestamp. That coin hit 1400 during the same day, a few days later was trading under 50 and within 3 months was completely dead. There were other obvious PND's to stay away from in this group. DCT dropped from 19.19 to 3.02 over 4 days just a month prior. MCO had its ICO date 6 weeks prior and was already 77.78% in the red. 

OMNI, while not an obvious PND, was way off it's ATH, which was in late 2013 at 1150. By July 2017, it was trading at 42.99. Now, it's at $4.20. That reminds me of a current coin that is in the Top 25 right now that had a much higher valuation than it currently does *cough cough ICP cough*. It'll be interesting to see where that coin stands in 4 years, if it does at all.

Over 60% of coins in this list had their ATH occur between December 2017 and January 2018. EOS is an anomaly in the fact that it is the only coin to have its ATH in 2018 but not in January. There are 18 coins who had their ATH in 2021 and, assuming the crypto market recovers to reach new ATH's, they are poised to potentially also have new ATH's in the future. The 18 coins are:

BTC, ETH, LTC, ETC, XMR, WAVES, DOGE, MAID, DGB, DCR, BAT, DGD, DAWN, ANT, LEO, NMR, RLC and STORJ. 

Finally, out of the 100 coins:

35% turned a profit over 4 years.

12% lost between 75-90% in value. 23% lost between 90-99.98% in value. 10% became casualties and are Zero Coins.

If you threw a dart at the board, you'd have roughly a 1 in 3 shot of making a profit and a 1 in 5 shot of doubling your money.

The chances were greater if you saw obvious PND's and either avoided them or invested but got out in time. The easiest one to predict was BCC. Personally, I was invested in BCC and got out within 15 minutes of seeing their promo video in Singapore, headlined by Carlos Matos. That shit was laughable and it was time to nope the fuck out of there. 

I hope you enjoyed seeing some of these numbers. Personally, it was fun to look into some coins that I haven't thought about in years and to research some that I'd never heard of before. It will be interesting to visit today's Top 100 in 4 years to see which ones have survived and which ones will either be struggling or will be non-existent. Questions and comments are welcome. It's late here (2:30 am), but if I don't get to your question tonight, I'll be sure to look into it tomorrow!

Edit: I forgot to post the total. $100/coin invested makes the total investment $10,000. The total today would be $22,595.80. Over 40% of that is DOGE. The Top 5 Gainers (DOGE, BTC, XLM, ETH, XVG) would account for $13,331.89 of that total, or 60%.",3360,2021-07-24 07:30:59,718

USDT,cryptocurrency,ZRX/USDT Analysis – Bullish Bias with Some Caution,"**Long hold \[4-6 weeks\]**   
  
Hey everyone, here’s a quick breakdown of why I think ZRX/USDT could be heading bullish on a longer scale using the weekly chart for analysis, We are a key point and I believe there could be a long awaited reversal here over the next few days (I still feel there will be a few more red days before we see this reversal). There are a few things to keep an eye on:

1. **Price Action & Moving Averages**
   * Current price: $0.4218, up 14.59% this week.
   * The price is currently **above all key moving averages**:
      * **MA7**: $0.3489
      * **MA25**: $0.3397
      * **MA99**: $0.3351
   * **Bullish signal**: The price is comfortably above these levels, indicating a strong bullish trend across short, medium, and long terms. These MAs could now act as support if the price retraces.
2. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
   * **RSI(6)**: 69.72 — Getting close to overbought territory (70). Not quite there yet, but it shows strong bullish momentum.
   * **What to watch**: If RSI crosses 70, we might see a stronger bull trend. However, if it stays too high for too long, a pullback could be on the horizon. So, the RSI is signaling strength, but it’s approaching a level where we need to be cautious about short-term corrections.
3. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
   * **MACD(20, 50, 9)**: The MACD line is at **-0.0195**, just above the signal line at **-0.0219**.
   * The histogram is positive, which means **bullish momentum** is gaining strength. Although it’s still below zero, the MACD crossover is a sign that the trend might be flipping bullish.
4. **Volume**
   * There's been an **increase in volume** lately, which supports the price increase. When volume picks up, it typically shows that the move is being backed by real buying interest, not just speculative spikes.
   * If this volume continues, it would confirm the current move as genuine.

# Bullish Signals:

* Price is above major moving averages.
* RSI is strong, nearing the overbought zone but still in bullish territory.
* MACD crossover and positive histogram signal growing bullish momentum.
* Volume supports the move, suggesting strength behind the rally.

# Bearish Risk:

* RSI is creeping up on 70, so we could see a short-term pullback if it enters the overbought region.
* MACD is still below zero, so this might be an early stage rally — don’t expect the trend to last forever without a solid break above zero.

# Conclusion:

I’m leaning **bullish** on ZRX/USDT here. The price action, moving averages, RSI, MACD, and volume are all pointing to a potential continuation upwards. But keep an eye on the RSI, volume trends, and watch for a breakout above 70 on RSI — that could be your signal for a possible pullback.",1,2024-11-20 05:03:25,2
USDT,cryptocurrency,What happens to instruments if Tether (USDT) crashes next?,"If Tether (USDT) is the next in line for slaughter what would realistically happen to Binance instruments like BTCUP/USDT and BTCDOWN/USDT? Would they ""correct"" themselves like BTC/USDT did when it hit ""100k""? I.e. keep the intrinsic dollar value or would it remain ""static"" in terms of USDT value and thus crash in intrinsic dollar value?

For the sake of argument if either BTCUP or BTCDOWN was trading at 30 USDT which would equal an intrinsic value of 30 $ and USDT/USD crashes to 0.5 $ would BTCUP or BTCDOWN then ""correct"" and trade at 60 USDT, keeping the intrinsic value of 30 $ ?",36,2022-05-12 04:30:38,112

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009 and since then it has become much more of a Store of Value than a currency, given its scarcity and high security, although layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network allows for fast and cheap transactions.
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** the coin of the Ethereum blockchain, the first smart contract platform and the one having the biggest ecosystem of decentralized applications around: since ETH price is used to pay fees to interact with the network, a bigger ecosystem means higher demand. It is (and will be) used for staking in Ethereum 2.0 (which is PoS).
3. **Tether (USDT):** the most discussed stablecoin around, pegged to the dollar price although many believe it is not fully backed: for this reason its market cap has been decreasing for the first time ever and other stablecoins are gaining traction.
4. **Binance Coin (BNB):** the official Binance coin and the one used to pay fees on the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain like Ethereum but less decentralized and with cheaper fees (not counting any layer 2 solutions).
5. **Cardano (ADA):** the coin of the PoS blockchain Cardano, created by the Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and developed strictly following peer-reviewed research, which slowed down development. Lots of partnerships and a big community make it one of the biggest ETH contenders.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** a centralized coin trying to redefine online payments, has had a rough time after the SEC went after it but seemingly it's coming out on top.
7. **USD Coin (USDC):** another stablecoin tied to the dollar and managed by the company Circle. Considered more trustworthy than Tether, it's been growing non-stop adoption-wise.
8. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** such wow, even higher ranking than last time. *sigh*
9. **Polkadot (DOT):** it's the coin of Polkadot, a multichain protocol aiming to connect different chains, both public and private, allowing to transfer data between one another or to create new custom blockchains. ChainLink's oracle pallet and Kusama are examples of projects built on top of it.
10. **Binance USD (BUSD):** another stablecoin pegged to the dollar, managed by Binance in partnership with Paxos.
11. **Uniswap (UNI):** the first token on the list, it's used to govern the decentralized trading protocol Uniswap, probably the biggest and most known DeFi application built on Ethereum.
12. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** a fork of Bitcoin trying to increase scalability and lower transaction fees increasing the blockchain block size, which achieves these features but reduces [decentralization](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f32dac47-a7a6-4e5d-af5b-28e4f1d87287).
13. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin younger brother, been around since 2011. It's based on the Bitcoin code but with some tweaks, lowering transaction speed and cost, many sees it as the ""silver"" of crypto since it's been around for so long.
14. **Chainlink (LINK):** between one Ganon and the other Link is also the official token of ChainLink, a network that basically bridges off-chain data with smart contracts: an example is Synthetix, a derivatives protocol that uses Chainlink to get the price feed of a certain asset on their smart contract.
15. **Solana (SOL):** one of the latest Ethereum contenders, launched in 2020 and offering possibly the highest layer-1 thoughput of all (50k transaction per second!), but is still somewhat centralized (although this is being addressed) and has yet to build a competitive ecosystem.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** it's a tokenized version of Bitcoin so it can be used on the Ethereum network and in DeFi applications.
17. **Polygon (MATIC):** the most popular layer-2 solution for Ethereum, Matic is the official coin of Polygon and used to pay fees on it: many Ethereum applications are moving there but it's still not easy to use with few exchanges supporting it directly.
18. **Ethereum Classic (ETC):** native token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain, a hard fork of Ethereum that claims to be more tied to Ethereum original plan. It has suffered various 51% attacks in the past years.
19. **Stellar (XLM):** created by an ex-Ripple founder, its aim is to become a currency and to allow to trade assets in a cheap and fast way. Last time I joked it was a 40c stablecoin, now I wished that held true.
20. **THETA (THETA):**  The token of THETA, a decentralized video delivery network (in a p2p fashion), used mainly for governance.

USDT,cryptocurrency,"Had to do an international transfer and it took a total of 20 days and didn't even go through, used ERC20 USDT and it took 15 minutes","So just like the title says. I was paying for something that accepts FIAT and USDT and I decided to use fiat money instead of their option to just send ERC20 USDT. I thought you know ""lets just do it the normal way as I just have to add some info and thats it"" **WRONG.**

I added all the info but I missed one little instruction since it was an international transfer and it used an intermediary bank. Paid 3% to send the amount and 5 days later the recipient hadn't *received it yet*. 

I called the bank, which in turn helped me recall the payment. But *GUESS WHAT??*  yeah, they didn't actually recalled it so I had to call again to verify if they actually recalled it, bear in mind that I did this cause I was paranoid as it was a good amount of money, they told me they hadn't recalled it and they would do it later. I told them that I wasn't going to wait and to do it right there, apparently I was mad enough cause she actually did it.

Around 15 days later I got my money back with 3% less off-course as that was the fee I lost for doing the transaction in the first place. 

Right there and then (as soon as I was sure my fiat was back in my account) I decided to do the ERC20 USDT option and I timed it, even with swapping ETH to USDT and then sending and them receiving it all took ***15 minutes.***

I just want to say that who ever is thinking crypto doesn't have the potential to move the world is just not looking at the shitshow their centralized system is, we can do better and this is the answer to that.",191,2021-06-04 22:30:31,93

USDT,cryptocurrency,What kind of impact on the entire crypto market would crash of Tether - USDT have?,"Stories about the Tether - USDT failure have been a topic in the crypto world for years.  

I am very interested in hearing your opinion on this mather and what steps would you take if this would happen. 

Stablecoin, Tether USDT is ranked #3 in the cryptocurrency world by market capitalization, with over $83 billion in value.  Therefore, it is logical that in the event of the collapse of this company, which keeps the value of its token at $1 with its reserves, which many people doubt, it would be chaotic for the crypto market.  

**Question: How would you preserve the value of your assets?**  

\- Bitcoin is one choice, but in the event of a USDT crash: The price of Bitcoin would start going down because all the people would sell their cryptocurrencies out of fear of big drop in price.   Therefore, in order to maintain the value of your currencies, you would have to sell them, convert them to some other stablecoin or fiat, send them to the bank, and then buy them back later.  Is this the only way to save you money?

\-The price of Bitcoin would go up because people would try to convert their usdt to Bitcoin? 

But would that be possible considering that the exchange would probably pause withdrawals, maybe trading as well, and if USDT crashes, would you have time to react at all?  
    
I am of the opinion that the consequences would be enormous. People would lose confidence in cryptocurrencies, if only for a good part of it for a while. They would potentially not be able to save the value of what they had in crypto just before the USDT crash. 

Also, the media would pump up the story to the point of exhaustion, thus possibly triggering another bear market in the crypto.

I downloaded and used all the ‘free’ ways to earn crypto I read about on the internet and on reddit, so that you don’t have to. I tried to use them all for at least a month to see what kinds of earnings there were. They are listed in order according to how much I recommend them, from best to worst.

\*FULL DISCLAIMER:\* on most of these sites I used fake names and new emails to register. Some of them may be harvesting your data or providing other security concerns. Please do your own research, be safe, and remember that many apps and websites do not have your best interest in mind.

&#x200B;

\*\*Brave Browser\*\*

What it is: Brave is a free browser to download and use - essentially an alternative to Chrome or Firefox. And as an actual browser, I must say I’m quite pleased. It’s fast, simple, and comes with built in adblocker and Tor browser. But we aren’t here to talk about free browsers. In addition to blocking ads, Brave (if you allow it to) will send you ads of their own, and give you the revenue in crypto. Every fifteen minutes or so while browsing the net, a little popup text box appears in the bottom right of my screen, advertising a product. I close it out, and a few pennies are added to my account. Brave pays out in the form of BAT tokens. It was easy to setup - simpler if you have an uphold account - and I found the ads to be unobtrusive.

Results: I’ve had Brave for more than a year now and in that time have accumulated 58 BAT, currently worth $46 CAD. Considering that a) I like this browser more than Chrome and b) I have now completely forgotten about the ads and click them away unconsciously, I think this is great. It also helps that BAT has risen so significantly in the last year, and if its a coin you see promise in, I can’t recommend this enough.

Verdict for Brave: Excellent. Highly Recommended.

&#x200B;

\*\*Presearch\*\*

What it is: It’s a search engine. You can use it instead of google. Just like google, there are ads - sites paying to be listed first - but unlike google, they pay you a portion of the revenue. If you’ve ever used Bing’s reward program, its very similar but in crypto rather than fiat. I set it as the search engine in browser bar, and as someone who googles things regularly (me bid dumb ape) I was quickly gaining coins. As a search engine I would say it is ‘okay.’ Though it is designed so you can easily switch to looking at your results in google.

Results: You gain .12 tokens per search (up to 30 per day) and can withdraw after gaining 1,000 tokens. Obviously, how much you make will depend on how often you search things. Personally, I set this as my default search engine and forgot all about it. Do your own research, but I see no downsides.

Verdict for Presearch: Good. Recommended.

&#x200B;

\*\*Honey Miner\*\*

What it is: It’s a crypto miner that assesses your computers capabilities, and runs accordingly (or so it claims). I have a MacBook Pro, so certainly no mining rig. No GPUs, really nothing that could help me do actual crypto mining. So I set up Honeyminer, and it mines in the background with the resources that are available.

Results: My MacBook got hot and got hot fast. I left it overnight a few times, but honestly, I was concerned about the heat, so I googled it. Sure enough, this is a common issue, and from what I read online, it’s a bad idea to let it run for too long unless you have a third-party cooling unit. This meant that I was left running it for short spurts during the day, which was far less effective. If you have a gaming computer or proper cooling system, this might work well for you. Otherwise, I’m not so sure.

After a month I stopped using it for fear of damaging my computer. In the month that I did use it (as I said, on and off) I made 1200 Satoshi, currently worth about $0.40 USD. But honestly a) I didn’t run it near as much as I could and b) it runs in the background, meaning virtually no time and effort after installation. If you are able to run this without damaging your hardware, why not? As always, do your own research, but this seems okay to me.

Verdict for Honeyminer: Could be good if you have the right computer

&#x200B;

\*\*COIN geominer\*\*

What it is: A phone app that (claims to) scrape geodata and turn it into reward points that can be redeemed for crpyto. I’m essentially a blue blip on a map of my city, and as I move around, the square area I’m on is “mined” and turns blue. The more squares you mine, the more coins you get, and you can re-mine a square after a few minutes. Just think of it as a far simpler version of Pokemon go. I usually go for a walk each day, so I brought it with me and mined all the trails and parks in the area. I’d boot up the app, stick it in my hoodie pocket (can’t lock the screen) and a half hour walk would drain about half my battery. You can also fill out surveys and watch videos to earn coins, but this sort of defeats the idea of being “free,” since this actually requires time.

Results: In 3 months I have made 4,000 in-app coins. 10,000 coins can be redeemed for XYO Erc-20 tokens. 1.8 million coins can be redeemed for 0.025 Bitcoin and 5.4 million can be redeemed for one ETH. The quickest way to gain coins is not to use the geominer at all, but to fill out surveys. Back in a different lifetime I used to fill out surveys for a local company and got paid by cheque (in fiat obviously) and I’d say the prices are similar. Currently I walk with the app, let it drain my battery, check in for bonuses everyday and it will take about 9 months to earn some XYO coins which really don’t seem worth it. To earn BTC will require about ten years. I’d say stick with the surveys. The pay isn’t good, but its comparable to other places that pay you to do surveys.

Verdict for COIN: Skip the geomining feature. If you’re willing to write surveys, they will pay you in crypto.

&#x200B;

\*\*Stormgain Express\*\*

What it is: It claims to be a Bitcoin miner for your phone, but it most certainly is not. Basically every four hours you log onto the app, hit the “bitcoin miner” button and it will start spitting out some numbers that look like crypto wallet addresses. Each time you mine it will give you a little bit of money. According to the app and the website, it sincerely claims this is bitcoin mining. However, if you know anything (and I mean ANYTHING) about bitcoin mining, this has to be a straight up lie. Mining on my phone (and a crappy one at that)? It works even when I turn off my wifi and data? And my phone doesn’t even overheat? I don’t know what’s going on here, but they claim its bitcoin mining. Anyways, I tried to reactivate this every four hours. I’m going to say I ran it an average of three times a day for two months.

Stormgain express is also just a good old fashioned crypto exchange. You can put in money and trade. So bear that in mind - some people may want to use this as their primary trading app, and let the miner add a few pennies along the way. In fact, it claims it will mine faster if you deposit money. You can do this at your own risk - I never did, and can’t vouch for the security of the app. I only ever used the free miner, and added no money of my own.

Results: You can withdraw your money after you make $10 USDT, which took me about a month. Honestly, not bad for an I-don’t-know-what-you’re-actually-doing-app. Once you’ve withdrawn the money, you can turn them into put calls on a crypto of your choice. I used the app for a second month and only made $2. So I’m guessing it’s an incentive to get you in for the first month, and then productivity seemed to plummet. I should also add that there are incentives for getting your friends to download and mine with you.

Verdict for Stormgain: It’s good for the first month.

&#x200B;

\*\*Pi\*\*

What it is: An app where you log in everyday and click a button to ‘mine digital currency.’ You can do this once every 24 hours. Pi claims to be a crypto coin that will be ‘launching soon.’ In other words, I’m getting paid in a coin that hasn’t dropped yet.

Results: If Pi is a real coin that drops someday and becomes valuable, that’s great, I’ve got lots. But I’m doubtful. I’m not sure what harm there is to “mining” every day, but the whole thing feels shady. The app claims that once the coin drops you won’t be able to mine anymore so now is the time to do so. I’m not convinced Pi will ever materialize.

For now, I’ve mined every day for almost 3 months and have made 136 pi. How much is this worth you ask? Nothing. Nada. Zilch. If you believe the developers are really developing something, go for it, I guess. I see no harm in this app (do your own research) I just don’t see any benefit.

Verdict for Pi: Not worth it.

&#x200B;

\*\*Cointiply\*\*

What it is: It’s both an app and a website that offers free Bitcoin hourly. All you have to do is log in and fill out a captcha and you are rewarded. I tried to check back in hourly for a month. I’m going to say I averaged 5-6 times per day.

Results: After one month I have made 2,483 in-app coins, worth .00000762 BTC, or $0.25 USD. The minimal withdrawal amount is 50,000 coins (30,000 if you withdraw to DOGE). At this rate it will take me 20 months to make a withdrawal. In that time I will have earned approximately $5 USD, which will then be converted into whatever the price of BTC is at that time. That is, if this site actually pays out and isn’t a scam. Anyone willing to wait 20 months to find out?

Verdict for Cointiply: Not Worth it

&#x200B;

\*\*Free Cypto/Faucet Apps\*\*

What it is: There’s a bunch of these apps (I have an android but I assume iPhones are the same) that claim to offer free crypto and/or to be faucets. I downloaded several and they are all essentially the same. I ended up using one called ‘Free Litecoin’ for a month to see how it went. Every hour you can log in and hot a button that spins and decides if you won free coins or not. I played an average of 5-6 times per day for a month and would say I usually won once per day. You can watch ads to earn additional spins, which, if I’m not mistaken, increased my chances of winning. As far as I can tell, all of these apps (and there are many of them) are essentially the same. It’s a randomized game that may or may not pay out every hour.

Results: ‘Free Litecoin’ pays in Litoshi (the smallest unit of Litecoin). After one month I have made 14,855 Litoshi. You need 100,000 to withdraw. Bear in mind there are 100 million Litoshi on a litecoin. This means that at current trading value, I make approximately 29 cents Canadian each month in this app. It will take me more than 6 months to make a withdrawal, worth about $1.70 CAD. That is, assuming you actually can withdraw and this isn’t just a scam.

Verdict for Free Crypto Apps: Not Worth It

USDT,cryptocurrency,I think my mate has been scammed big time and lost all his savings,"
So this girl added my mate on facebook pretending she is really interested in him, they exchanged messages back and forth for a few days and then she started recommending crypto trading saying she’s been a trader for almost 10 years and she’s worked for some of the biggest finance companies etc she tells him if he follows her advice on when to buy and sell, he can make thousands every week.

Long story short, invested 3k on a trading platform called metapro-fx.com
He made £20k within 2-3 days and then further invested further £12k of his savings and supposedly made £100k profit within a week. So now he wants to withdraw the £100k (USDT) profit from the wallet into his bank account, however he needs to pay a 5% fee (roughly 5k) upfront before he can withdraw the £100k profit.

Now he is desperately going round borrowing money from friends and family to raise the 5k fee. What’s the likelihood that he’s getting scammed because he seems to be adamant and completely brainwashed that this is totally legitimate and the reason that girl has been giving him all this trading advice is because she’s really into him and she really likes him. He’s been accusing me of being jealous and a hater every time I tried convincing him this sounds waaaay too good to be true and is most likely a scam. Apparently I’m jealous that he made £100k in a week 🤦‍♂️

USDT,cryptocurrency,"Binance Trades Majority of BUSD to USDT, 5 Billion Dumped for Dollars","Since Feb 13 Paxos stopped mining BUSD. Most likely from SEC pressure. Over 5 Billion BUSD has been redeemed for dollars. A good since it didn’t depeg. Also all withdraws are still active thankfully. So there were about 16.1 billion BUSD coins in circ, but now there are around 11,129,348,406 BUSD circulating. Binance trade the most volume at 6.84 Billion and the majority of transactions have been found to be to USDT. Strange enough the Turkish Lira was about 3% of transactions.

While this is all a lot to take in and understand why Binance wouldn’t try and back up their coin and instead fold but the bright side is….

Bloomberg has just published a detailed article trying to ideintify the source of the $69 Billion backing Tether, only to conclude that they have not been able to identify the money.

The only source who would speak to Bloomberg is the person running Deltec bank in Bahamas, who could account for around 1/4th of Tether's money (around $15 BN) but stayed coy when quizzed on the other money.

Tether has never tried to explain where exactly their money is stashed. If their statements are true, they would be the world's 7th largest commercial paper holder, with almost $30 bn in this..but no one in wall street has heard of them.

All of this unfolded over the last few months, but just few hours ago the CEO of Tether has deleted his twitter account.

Here are the USDT prices throughout the past years :


June 7th, 2015 : $1

January 23th, 2017 : $1

April 13rd, 2018 : $0.9977 (bear market was wild)

August 11th, 2020 : $1.0014 (bull run pump!)

Today, May 29th 2021 : $1

This is the response I got after providing all the documents they want and answered all of their questions.

No explanation. Straight up reject and on the way to disable my account.

The entire process took almost 2 months.

&#x200B;

They were very skeptical about my source of funds.

My initial source of funds is my father's gift. I put the money into crypto market, following my trading strategy, I made more money than 90% of jobs in my country. So I define myself as a self-employed individual.

I provided the documents of

1. My father transfer money to me.
2. My monthly trade (positive gain every month).
3. Proof of ownership of my father's export company.
4. Export declarations documents of the company.

It should be more than enough to prove where the money came from and why I am self-employed.

If they want my father to hold a paper in front of the camera saying he was not threatened by me, I will ask him to do that.

Oh wait...

Anyway, after cleared all their doubt, they still rejected and disabled my account. My $150 initial deposit is gone.

I will never be able to change USD to USDT or change USDT back to USD at Tether.

Wasn't this a big ""f\*ck you"" in the face to everyone who are against crypto?

Imagine one country being at war. The situation is pretty bad, I don't have to explain why.

Now imagine that country seeking for help in crypto? That country is, we all know, Ukraine.

And we can ask everyone - Why is cryptocurrency, extremely volatile asset, detached from the financial system, highly speculative asset used as a safe haven for people in need? 

Because it allows anyone and everyone to be able to convert their personal wealth into highly portable, most of the time decentralized,  forms of money. And people who are leaving their homes, who want access to their funds, who want to be able to keep them safe will use crypto.

Isn't this a strong use case? This is what we talked about for years. 

People from Ukraine are using crypto to survive, escape, buy something.

Ukrainian central bank limited ATM withdrawals, placed restrictions on the country’s official electronic-currency system and suspended the foreign-exchange market.

Russian citizens, considering their national currency downtrend are also seeking help in cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are really on the global stage right now.

As in the name, the government-run Central Market is a market of food items produced from crop production areas across the country. Not only are there produce of fruits and vegetables but also meats, nuts, grains, meals and common delicacies  as well as more miscellaneous sellers on the outskirts like phone sellers ,flowers, spices and trinkets etc. The Central Market of Buenos Aires has its own laboratories for bromatology, microbiology, phytopathology, and fishery products.

The Market is estimated to serve 12 million people(likely an underestimate), more than 500 wholesale companies and process 1,400,000 tons of fruit and vegetable species annually. KryptonMarket functions essentially as on on/off ramp and trading platform for crypto and allows citizens to escape the inflationary spiral and crisis of the local currency by investing in crypto and their deal with the Market also makes citizens able to functionally spend that crypto directly on essentials. Workers at the market may also receive a portion of their wages in crypto.

USDT,cryptocurrency,"To ""The Guy That Got Scammed for 200k USDT"", and other scam victims:","If you've recently been scammed and are trying to hustle the situation to get some money back, and part of that is by offering a bounty,    
    
**I strongly suggest not posting the details on one of the world's largest crypto subreddits.**    
    
Posting on a public forum about the fact that you can play act as decoy, or explaining/suggesting other routes of attack, isn't a solid strategy. Op-sec, yo.    
    
To be clear, you're posting publicly about:    
1. Who they are / their crypto handles    
2. How much you lost    
3. That you're putting a bounty on them    
4. That you can/will continue to interact with them under false pretenses to try to hustle them back.    
    
That means they know that you're talking about them, that you are the person they got for 200k, that you're putting a bounty on them, that you're working with law enforcement, and that any future times that you interact with them you will attempt to trick them.    
    
It's very possible that person has seen the bounty post, which means they know way too much already. I got it as a push notification because it was so popular.    
    
Instead, make a post saying you have a bounty and the amount, that you're looking for crypto sleuths or white hats, and let people contact you directly.    
    
Or seek support publicly, but don't discuss any of the details; such as who the person is, or other identifying information. All that does is harm your ability for restitution. Ask general questions / request general suggestions.    
    
Since you've been scammed and a public post like this on r/CC was the way you're going about trying to fix that, I strongly suggest taking some time away from crypto to consider how you interact with the crypto space, and with the internet on the whole, in terms of security.",84,2021-11-26 17:43:05,91

While CZ has been praising themselves about the safte of it a lot, especially when UST failed and FTX crashed down. But now (not so surprisingly) even they don‘t seem so safe as their issuer Paxos got flagged by the DEC with a lawsuit.

Obviously this generated a lot of FUD for BUSD and a lot of people started to withdraw their BUSD pretty quickly as we also had one of the biggest outflows of stablecoins on exchanges, ever. As BUSD has alone accounted for $424M of those outflows while USDT was also affected by the FUD around stablecoins but just say $250M in outflows.

Welcome to the monthly recap for the 3rd of 4 homemade Top Ten Crypto Index Funds. The 2020 Portfolio is made up of: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Tether, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, EOS, Binance Coin, BitcoinSV,** and **Tezos.**

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly. Did the same in 2019, 2020, and 2021. ***Learn more about the Experiment history, rules, and FAQs (including the answer to the ""WHY TETHER?!?!"" question)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***

1. Scaling down from four to two monthly reports.
2. Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time.
3. ***Factoring in stablecoin gains***: In the past, I have not included ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports. This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).
4. Giveaways: I’ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I’m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.
5. Friendly competition (or Battle Royale?): I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP [r/TotalCryptoMarketCap](https://np.reddit.com/r/TotalCryptoMarketCap/)) to see which one outperforms.

Here we go:

 

## Two Year Report – UP 795%

📷

The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, ETH, XRP, USDT, BCH, Litecoin, EOS, BNB, BSV,** and **Tezos**.  

December highlights for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* All 2020 Top Ten cryptos down by double digits.
* After two years, the 2020 Portfolio is +795%.
* The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio retains the title of best performing of all four Top Ten Experiments.

This group of cryptos highlights the benefits of an index fund strategy: the **+795%** return of the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio has *outperformed eight of the individual component cryptos contained within the Index.* Only by guessing right and throwing all your eggs into **Ethereum** and/or **Binance Coin** would you have performed better than spreading out the risk, index style.  

## December Ranking and Dropout Report

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**  after two years, half of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out:  **EOS**, **BSV, Tezos, Litecoin,** and **Bitcoin Cash** have been replaced by **Cardano,** **Polkadot, Solana, Luna,** and **USDC.**

At #61, **BSV** has sunk the lowest since January 2020.

## December Winners and Losers 

***December Winners*** – no winners this month: besides stablecoin **USDT**, all cryptos in this portfolio lost value.

***December Losers*** –  **Litecoin** fell -30% this month, followed by the second worst performing crypto **EOS**, down -24% in December. 

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After two years, here’s a snapshot of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment’s monthly winners and losers: 

With six monthly victories, **ETH** leads the pack.  **Tether** still has the most monthly losses, a good sign for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio.

## Two Year Update – BNB victorious, followed by second place ETH. All cryptos in positive territory. 2020 Top Ten best performing of the four Top Ten Experiments.

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio continues to be the best performing of the four [Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 100% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive territory, most have at least *triple digit price growth* and two have *four digit growth* (**BNB** and **ETH**).  **Binance Coin** continues to hold a commanding lead over second place **Ethereum.**

The initial $100 investment two years ago into first place **Binance Coin**? Currently worth **$3,699**, an increase of +3,598%.    

In second is **Ethereum,** also with quadruple digit gains, up +2,782%.

Besides **USDT**, the worst performer in the 2020 group is **EOS,** up +22% since January 2020.   

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/2k720xq9ctd81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=02721b067faea6d3e431d970081e915407d798b5

As a sector, crypto is up **+1,066%** over the two year lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.

If you were able to capture the entire crypto market since [January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) (+1,066%), you’d be doing quite a bit better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+795%) and ridiculously better than the S&P (+48%) over the same time period.  Much more on the S&P below.

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio lost $2,209 in December and is now worth **$8,951** (+795%) from the initial $1k investment.  

The 2020 Portfolio remains the best performing of [the four Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 

Below is a month by month ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along:

https://preview.redd.it/pgpvfixcctd81.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ce72699d89f846a01f0cefbcad351a8d5c46df8

The portfolio has yet to experience a red month, although in [March 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/) it came close, returning a COVID induced low of +7%.

**Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios** 

So, where do we stand if we combine four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48): up +34% (total value $1,341)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36): up +504% (total value $6,044)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24): up +795% (total value $8,951)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12) up +292% (total value $3,921)

So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,257** ($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).

**That’s up +406%** on the combined portfolios, **down from**[ **last month’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23) for the Top Ten Index Fund Experiments. 

Lost in the numbers? Here’s a table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

https://preview.redd.it/qaeh607ectd81.jpg?width=511&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b6f94cea9cec2a4d888af73d3a892768195fbc2

In summary: ***That’s a +406% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four straight years***.

## Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/oonu9hcfctd81.png?width=504&format=png&auto=webp&s=22ce5dcd8f380ce292d5e50190483e662fc75996

Since the S&P 500 has returned +48% since January 1st, 2020, that same [$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) in January 2020 would be worth $1480 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 instead. 

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning **+795%**, worth **$8,951.**

***That’s a difference of $8,280.***  

***On a $1k investment!*** 

But that’s just 2020. What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,430** ($1,780 + $1,900 + $1,480 + $1,270).

That is up **+61%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+406%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

To help provide perspective, here’s a quick look at the combined four year ROI for the Top Ten cryptos vs. the S&P up to this point.

## Conclusion:

For those who have supported the Experiments over the years, thank you.  For those just getting into crypto, I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride!

Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports.

USDT,cryptocurrency,Why is USDT still the 3rd crypto for market cap?,"Stablecoin Tether (USDT) is the third biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it is obviously the biggest stablecoin on the market. However, it's popularity does not necessarily means it is a great invesment. Theter is know in the crypto comunity not for being the best stablecoin in the market, and guess what, a lot of people here hate it.

First of all, to better understand the Theter problem, we should take a look at the differnt types of stablecoin

# DIFFERENT TYPES OF STABLECOINS

1. *traditional collateral:* those are the stablecoins backed up 1:1 by fiat currency, this type of stablecoin is considered an off-chain asset. Examples are USDT, GUSD and more.
2. *crypto collateral:* those are backed up by another crypto as collateral, this process occurs on chain and relies on smart contracts. DAI is the most popular one.
3. *algorithmic stablecoins:* their price stability results from the use of specialized algorithms and smart contracts that manage the supply of tokens in circulation. TERRA (UST) is the most popular.
4. *commodity backed stablecoins:* they are collaterized by physical assets (gold, oil,...). Examples are XAUT and PAXG

 People use stablecoins to facilitate cryptocurrency trading, transfer money, and earn interest. However, the lack of regulation and transparency surrounding these coins, particularly Tether, have authorities on edge. Here are a few reasons:

# 1)  USDT IS ONLY BACKED BY 2.9% IN CASH RESERVES 

This is probably the most problematic. Holding Theter is not the same as holding U.S. dollars. The price may be *pegged* to the dollar, but if there was a run on Tether(lots of people tried to swap their Tether for dollars), there's no guarantee the company would have enough cash to pay out (and people who held the coin would be fucked). 

Theter is in fact  backed up by cash, cash equivalents, secured loans, corporate bonds and other investments.  The trouble is that Tether hasn't released information about what types of loans it has made. We don't know who the borrowers are or what types of debt it is. Most importantly, we don't know how easy it would be for Tether to access that money. With that being said, USDT is only backed by 2.9% cash reserves

&#x200B;

[As you can see here, Cash \(in green\) is responsible for the 3.87&#37; of the \\""Cash & Cash equivalents\\"", which is roughly 2.9&#37; in total](https://preview.redd.it/oc4eb6fyhux81.png?width=2228&format=png&auto=webp&s=17347549bfdc93da1ed333588cc2eb0897e2a9b2)

# 2) Tether has had trouble with the New York Attorney General's office

the New York Attorney General reached a settlement with iFinex, the parent company of Tether and crypto exchange Bitfinex. Investigators accused the companies of unlawfully hiding losses. Attorney General Letitia James said, ""Tether’s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie.""

iFinex had to pay an $18.5 million fine and is no longer allowed to operate in New York. It will have to provide quarterly reports on its reserves, hence the breakdown we talked before. The company denies any wrongdoing. 

#  3) If Tether fails, it could shake the whole crypto industry

The worry is that Tether is operating in a similar way to a bank or other financial institution, but without any of the regulations that banks follow to protect consumers and prevent economic crises. That's why there's such a push for stricter stablecoin regulation: to protect both the economy and the crypto industry.

As Rohan Grey, assistant law professor at the Willamette University College of Law told the *Financial Times*, ""The growing world of stablecoins arguably underpins the entire crypto community right now. If that collapses, the whole space could collapse"". 

# CONCLUSION

As I stated before, USDT is not the only stablecoin, there are serveral ones that are either more transparent about what money they hold or they are either less centralized, so why the fuck are people still using it?

And you? Do you think that USDT is a ponzi? If so I would be glad if you commented down here!",39,2022-05-06 12:10:24,88
USDT,cryptocurrency,USDT - USDC - BUSD. How safe are they really?,"So with the downfall of UST I wonder, how safe are stablecoins really? Dai is something separate so I’m leaving that out of the equation for now. But what about the big three?

I’m genuinely utilise and don’t want to spread fud. I just want to know. How safe are they?

USDT has a very bad reputation and they have made massive mistakes in the past. But for the past 9 months or so they are posting pretty transparent audit reports and they seemed to be really have all the collateral they need? Am I missing something? 

USDC has a good reputation but their audit reports are far simpler and Tethers. And what happens if Coinbase (who made a MASSIVE loss in Q1) tumbles?

BUSD has a very simple audit report as well but they claim to be backed as well. What happens here if Paxos or Binance go broke? 

What seems to be the safest out the three? Or all they all equally safe?",26,2022-05-14 17:52:23,89

USDT,CryptoMarkets,Is Tether's decreasing market cap cause for concern?,"Speculation and possible FUD post. Please share your thoughts.

Let’s say a bad acting large institution wants to de-peg tether. How could they do it? I think we all probably correctly assume Tether doesn’t have enough dollars or cash equivalents backing it.

Big institution could buy or borrow 10 billion USDT. Sell it. Cause panic selling that turns into a death spiral? Is this possible?

Let’s say the big institution successfully causes the panic selling. Then BTC falls to from $30k to $10k. Big institution buys 10 billion dollars of BTC (1 million BTC). Then they pump BTC to $100k. Now big institution has a 100 billion dollar BTC portfolio. 10 billion was flushed down the toilet. Another 10 billion invested. They made 80 billion in profit. (If they could even sell 1 million BTC)

The charts for UST (Terra Luna’s stable coin) and USDT (Tether) are looking eerily similar.

UST (Terra Luna former stable coin) 7 day market cap (initial drop \~ 22% in 6 hours)

USDT (Tether) 7 day market cap (9% drop in a little over 3 days). Looks like multiple large sells may be staggered here. Institutional de-risking or the start of something nefarious?

https://preview.redd.it/4eouopxw1oz81.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8efd2e33ca0cd623fafff8d4605868616098d5d

It doesn’t appear USDT has ever had more than \~ 3% dip in market cap. We are currently triple (9%) that drop.

The price of USDT is also looking shakier than it has in the last year. You can see it still hasn't quite recovered to its normal level.

Is this cause for real concern or just a blip? Is the same thing that happened to UST happening slowly to USDT?

I’m just a regular moron so please poke holes in this because I can’t get it out of my head.

Garlinghouse highlighted Tether’s significance within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, emphasizing uncertainty regarding the broader impact of such actions. 

This comes amid growing concerns over the use of USDT by sanctioned nations and terrorist groups to bypass US financial restrictions, with US Treasury Deputy Secretary Adewale Adeyemo shedding light on Russia’s reliance on alternative payment methods like Tether’s USDT. Additionally, banking giant Deutsche Bank has raised questions about Tether’s operations, casting doubt on the stability of the stablecoin market.

USDT,CryptoMarkets,Tethers Unprecedented $11.6B Mortgage Loan Surges in Two Years,,6,2023-06-17 23:06:23,2
USDT,CryptoMarkets,Preparing for the Tether apocalypse which may crash the entire market,"There is a high likelihood that Tether is not backed 1:1 by US dollar, and that it is being used to artificially inflate the price of BTC and other cryptos. While Tethers are worth ""only"" $2.2bn in total, it has an oversized impact on the market; one analysis here: http://www.tetherreport.com/

When this bubble bursts, it will pose a systemic risk to the entire cryptomarket, bring BTC and others down by 80% or more, and pose on existential risk to many coins. If that outcome happens, regulators are likely to step in. The result may be a prolonged bear market, stagnation, and irreparable damage to cryptos.

I'd like to start a discussion on how can an individual investor or speculator prepare for this. I see a few strategies:

**Get out of cryptos *now* with the intention of buying back when the firesale begins.** This strategy doesn't require prescience, but you may be out of cryptos for months waiting for Tether to collapse, if not years, and thus losing gains happening during that time.

**Hold throughout the crash.** Least effort, but your portfolio may take years to recover to its pre-crash levels. If ever, depending on which coins you hold.

**Try to time the crash and get out of cryptos just before it, buy back at the bottom.** Most difficult to pull off. You need to identify the bubble bursting correctly, preferably hours if not days before the masses do.

Then you need to move your assets to an exchange where you can *quickly* convert them to fiat, and transfer them to your bank account. There are only a few exchanges with a semi-reliable fiat gateway, and they tend to have this only for a few cryptos, so depending on which coins you hold you may need multiple intermediate jumps across several exchanges. This means delays, fees, and potential for errors when you're doing everything in a hurry.

Holding assets at any exchange during a crash would be foolish. We've seen from past crashes that exchanges tend to become mysteriously unavailable, unresponsive or slow at these times.

If you miss the crash and try to cash out when everyone else is doing it, your sell or stop loss orders may be delayed or not work at all, or may close at unfortunate levels. Your fiat transfer to your bank may take longer, if it happens at all. And you may be worse off than holding if an exchange goes bankrupt.

**Ensure beforehand your account's *daily* deposit and withdrawal levels allow you to execute your exit strategy.** If the shit really hits the fan, I don't think it will take more than a few hours for exchanges to start becoming unreliable or unreachable.


There really isn't a good solution. Each of the strategies above have serious drawbacks. I think as a crypto speculator like myself who can lose everything without it impacting their life much, I'm inclined to just hold. If I was more confident in Kraken's reliability in liquidating coins they trade I might try that with some of my portfolio when I see first signs of the crash - which may have been today's announcement -, while holding onto other altcoins.",4,2018-01-28 11:25:03,61

USDT,CryptoMarkets,Tether Says There Is No Chinese Commercial Paper Among Its Reserves," Tether said the reserves backing its $66 billion stablecoin do not contain any Chinese commercial paper, likely marking the first time that the issuer of the world’s most used cryptocurrency explicitly stated it doesn’t hold the controversial assets.

Tether Holdings Ltd., which issues and operates the US dollar-pegged token USDT, had most recently refuted speculation that its token was 85% backed by Chinese or Asian commercial paper in June. It has been steadily decreasing its exposure to commercial paper in favor of holding US Treasury bills, with a goal of reducing its paper holdings to zero by early November.

[According to the official statement shared by Tether Limited today](https://getblock.io/blog/bitcoin-lightning-supercharged-new-product-by-bitfinex-tether/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo), on July 25, 2022, a new product has been launched as a result of the collaboration between stablecoin operator Tether, crypto exchange Bitfinex, and developers studio Hypercore.

USDT,CryptoMarkets,The truth about Bitfinex and Tether...,"EDIT: I realize this is long, but I feel it's important to have this info out there. Maybe save it for later when you see this narrative being pushed around so you can come back and get the other side. 

EDIT 2: TL:DR - Most negative analysis on this sub lately of Tether are likely from a single biased source that stretches a lot to make his points, and there is simply not enough Tether in the market nor is it concentrated enough to create a catastrophic problem or significant inflation for any USDT currency pair.


Like many of you, I have heard the stories and posts about the fraudulent tether, I trade in this space on many exchanges and the growing concern is worrying, so I did my due diligence, and I would like to share it with the community.


First and most importantly IMO, all this controversy stems from just one account/person. A person on twitter going by the handle @Bitfinexed - https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed 


Here you can see this person's writings - https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/latest


Spoofy, Tethers and institutional investors are what they contend to be the lies and fraud, AND that this entire rally in 2017 is based on fraudulent Tethers and spoofing, and that this will implode the markets.


I feel this is also important… Turns out this person sold at $1000, maybe the real reason he is on this mission??… 
https://twitter.com/whalepool/status/896460700461277185


Now for some troubling info, the majority of this narrative (FUD??) here on Reddit in the last month come from just three accounts.


https://www.reddit.com/user/AtlasRand1/submitted/


https://www.reddit.com/user/cetusfund/submitted/


https://www.reddit.com/user/AnythingForSuccess


As you can see these accounts entire mission is to post constantly about this. They all show up on the other’s post to comment regularly. 


Btw, some people on the pro-finex side think this is a smear campaign from other exchanges. I don’t believe this to be the case. This person(s) only talk about Tether/Finex, yet Tether is used and traded by the $millions daily on 3 of the top 5 exchanges, Finex, Bittrex, Polo, yet never a word about those other exchanges. (Check the USDT volume on other exchanges)
https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/tether/#markets 


Therefore, if it is an exchange, it isn’t Trex/Polo because this would affect them as well. If it was an exchange other than Trex/Polo they would have plenty of fire power against 3 of the top 5 exchanges with Tether fraud.


This leads me to believe it is most likely a sad person(s) with an ax to grind. They might have lost their $ on Finex to what they believe are spoofers/fraud and or they were part of the finex hack and sold there BFX too early. 


Btw I see contention that Bitfinex did NOT pay back the $ from the hack. They did, but some people are mad because they sold BFX early and didn’t recoup full $ amount from haircuts, but that was their decision.

POINTS OF CONTENTION



SPOOFING
This is what set my alarm bells off about these articles I read from Bitfinexed. Specifically spoofing… https://hackernoon.com/meet-spoofy-how-a-single-entity-dominates-the-price-of-bitcoin-39c711d28eb4 


and this nugget…“And who the hell is going to go margin long so dramatically after a huge crash?” from this article… https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/are-fraudulent-tethers-being-used-for-margin-lending-on-bitfinex-5de9dd80f330


Claiming spoofing shows this person has limited markets/trading knowledge. Clearly they haven’t watched an order book of any exchange in crypto, equities, or Forex. 


This is called scalping or scare walls. Again this is done in every market around the globe. 


Here is a professional FOREX trader talking about scalping, how it works, who/why they do it. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYMIPmgRb_M&list=WL&index=94


TL;DW - they do this to get the price where they want it because they know people are watching the order book (the video is quite enlightening), and the key point that keeps this from being an illegal activity (on regulated exchanges) is THAT THEY DO MAKE TRADES FOR THOSE SIZES eventually. This doesn’t always work and they get stuck in these positions. Risk/reward.


The ironic part about this spoofing idea is Finex is one of the few, if not only exchanges, that offer hidden orders. So people trying to scalp always have to worry if there is a monster hidden order lurking.  


Go to the UPDATE: AUGUST 7TH of this story and watch the video he claims proves spoofing and Phil Potter admitting it in the voice over. https://hackernoon.com/meet-spoofy-how-a-single-entity-dominates-the-price-of-bitcoin-39c711d28eb4 


I see nothing wrong with what Phil says and no proof of anything in the video. Again this is true on every exchange trading anything of volume in the world. People with large amounts of money move markets, oh the horror. I “technically” do this when I place an order and pull it for whatever reason (scared, mistake, etc.) just not in large sums, but I would if I had large sums. 


“And who the hell is going to go margin long so dramatically after a huge crash?” The crash they are referring to is from the early June ATH to the mid-July correction. A 45-day crash? Well, I am one of those people that went margin long. And many many others who read charts, resistance, support, retracement info. Again, this smacks of someone who doesn’t know what they are talking about.



REASON FOR PRICE RISE/BTC GOES UP WHEN TETHERS ARE CREATED


This is absurd. This completely negates everything else, the Japanese currency ruling and them entering the market, Koreans coming into the market in a huge way (they now have the largest exchange by far with close to a Billion traded DAILY, oh and they don’t use Tether at all), the successful hard fork, or the more (positive!) interest from the media and people than ever before in BTC history.  


Instead, we are supposed to think that $395 million dollars of tethers are the reason for this rise in a $160+ Billion market cap.
￼

C’mon people! Look at that volume for the last 30 days.
 https://imgur.com/a/vKJ5g
Also, the overwhelming majority of trade does not exist in Tether but KRW, CNY, USD, JPY. 


Tethers are usually created when extra liquidity is needed, be it a crash or a spike. Because more people are trading. 


They try to prove Tether boosts the market with this picture in their article.
https://imgur.com/a/274SE


The problem is 2 of the last 3 tether dumps coincide with a downturn. In fact, there is nothing in this graph that proves this theory. Also, the last tether dump/price rise coincides perfectly with the news of the majority of miners signaling segwit2x for the first time (search r/bitcoin or r/btc around that date). 


So do you think the market traded billions of $ at that time because of a $50 million Tether dump or because for the first time in YEARS a solution and path forward became visible??




THEY DON’T HAVE BANKING//NO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS/FAKE TETHERS-TERMS OF SERVICE


In regards to banking, clearly they have some kind of banking and a way for large amounts of fiat to get in and out. The banking is not for you and me but for regional bitcoin exchanges and other large customers. 


You know how I know this? If they didn’t the internet would be flooded with Finex withdrawal issues, there would be a price premium on Bitfinex compared to other exchanges, just like Mt. Gox had for so long and also Bitfinex earlier in the year when the banking issues started. 


This article explains it very clearly (seriously read this article), it has nothing to do with this controversy, just the banking issue in April.

https://medium.com/@Austerity_Sucks/why-bitfinex-went-from-a-premium-in-its-crypto-usd-pairs-to-now-a-significant-discount-e7be193d7cb0 


TL;DR - All of the imbalances discussed (Finex premium) have been a result of USD frictions into Bitfinex. It has been a chain reaction resulting from the initial freeze to the various gradual withdrawal options. As soon as Bitfinex conclusively addresses the USD flow issues, the crypto pair prices will normalize (which they did) with other exchanges that don’t have banking frictions and USDT price will return to par (which it did).


The premiums on Finex and Tether are what would prove something is wrong, yet they are not here. Surprisingly Finex has been at a discount to GDAX and GEMINI recently. Meaning people are willing to take a loss on prices to be able to lend on Finex. This too will normalize as people/bots arb. 


Aug 9th… From “arguably” bank fraud
https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed/status/895339675120013313


Aug 22nd…. To “admitting” bank fraud
https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed/status/900230917196836864


Listen to that audio in the second link, listen carefully. His explanation is perfectly reasonable. Banks don’t work well, consistently, or at all with crypto related companies (marijuana companies too for that matter) especially in jurisdictions that are outside US/Europe. Surprise surprise, this is nothing new.  When they find out customers, deposits/wire are cryptos related they pull the plug (a reason why Trex/Polo don’t mess with USD). 


Also, they gave their customers a haircut, probably a lot of complaints about the hack to Wells Fargo and other banks. These are the correspondent's banks, not Finex’s, they have banking. This is how they can receive large institutional deposits and withdrawals. Which I bet make up the majority of the fiat deposits and withdrawals. 


Classic 80/20 business rule, 20% of your clients are providing 80% of the liquidity plus you are having banking issues (which is expected in crypto-land), so you cut this service to the 80% saving time/resources/headaches for the 20% loss in a single service to them (no fiat withdrawal/deposits- but crypto flows in and out with ease).


Again if they weren’t able to get money in and out there would be a premium, there would be a long line of complaints online. I have no reason (or proof) to believe that money is NOT coming into/out of the exchange.


It makes total sense too, they are the best lending platform, have one of the most liquid exchanges, and have by far the most reliable and best software/servers/UI/order options. You cannot deny this fact, they are constantly a top 3 exchange in volume, even after a hack.


I use Finex (as well as others) because of all those things. Also, they have already been hacked, a second hack seems less likely (IMO, they have more to lose with another hack). They have many big events on the horizon (Ethfinex). Would a company be putting resources into these things if this is all fraud or an exit scam? I find that unlikely. Is this 100% full proof? Of course not, nothing is, especially in crypto, just my reasons for trading there.



Institutional Investors -  https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/are-legitimate-institutional-investors-really-coming-onto-bitfinex-s-platform-i-don-t-think-so-cb4ed5175092
Here is what this person doesn’t comprehend, what if these institutional investors are… you ready… here it comes… other exchanges that use Tether, as well as other crypto related businesses. It is only $395 million Tethers. These exchanges (Trex, Finex, Polo) are printing money. 


This isn’t “someone” with 100’s of millions of dollars as the article suggests, it’s many people with millions/thousands of dollars. Again this all ignores the fact that many more people have entered the ecosystem this year. This is proven by Coinbase growth, transaction growth, and exchange growth (both in volume and # of exchanges), and growth in crypto-related sub-Reddits. 


Yet Bitfinexed is shocked that lending hits ATH’s, but it is perfectly explainable and reasonable based on the evidence and data of gthe ecosystem. Let us not forget BTC is a finite amount, more people are going to increase demand/price, if you think this is a bubble... you haven’t seen anything yet. 


The TOS are sketchy and a point of concern but there are two things to keep in mind- It was necessary to word it that way, and the market clearly doesn’t care. 


If they had worded it that they will redeem no matter what, they would have money launderers flocking to the service (bogging down resources), plus law enforcement knocking. 


Tethers weren’t created to get $ in/out of crypto but to provide a safe haven and liquidity on exchanges that don’t use USD. And I would say they are working perfectly. Very few are withdrawing USDT for USD. 


I think it is precisely because of what the co-founder of tether refers to here (and below)… “If you want to convert USD₮ into fiat currency (or vice-versa) at tether.to, you must go through the whole “aggressive” KYC/AML process and get verified. I’ve heard from many who tried and were unable to provide sufficient documentation. Tether’s KYC/AML policies were written by experienced compliance officers and it’s critical that it be done properly and with diligence. It really is about “knowing your customer” and making sure that their uses are legitimate.”  This is a perfectly reasonable explanation why people are not lining up to cash out of Tether, and also why large/reputable institutions can (exchanges, investors, etc.).


 

TETHERS REPLY TO ALL THIS, PLUS UPCOMING AUDIT
https://tether.to/tether-update/


Now ask yourself this, would a company that is operating fraudulently have a roadmap of all these new features that no one will ever use if they don’t provide these promised audits as they say they will by the end of the year?


So as of now they have enough runway until the end of the year. I say we give Tether/Finex the benefit of the doubt.


While Tether could be operating fractionally (so to could any exchange in crypto btw), there is no proof or evidence of it today. It trades at normalized rates. You can’t just create 100’s of million of dollars without the marketing realizing somewhere.


Sure, you can say this is a confidence game, but so is crypto, so is the USD, so is the concept of money. I see no reason to be more concerned with this risk than the already risky environment we trade in with exchanges.




WHAT IF I”M WRONG? CRYPTO WILL IMPLODE!


No it won’t. Sure there will be a dip maybe even a correction, but there are only 395 million Tethers. People will get out of Tether even at massive discounts (until $0) into crypto because they can’t get USD, but not more than the 395 million tethers circulating (at this time). 


At a certain discount people will understand what is going on and stop trading for Tether. BTC + ETH is worth over $100 billion, how many time does the entire amount of USDT have to turn over to cause a massive crash?  


What will get hit the hardest are the people left holding tether (if/when they implode) and Trex/Polo/Finex. 


To think Polo/Trex would rely so much on USDT that they didn’t fully vet it is absurd as well. Whats more likely, Polo/Trex’s due diligence or this @Bitfinexed person based on conjecture?


I’ve already seen a Forbes contributor try and get ahold of Bitfinexed on twitter. https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/894437272241569792  


Could I be wrong about all of this??? Of course, but, I feel I have provided more evidence than the other side. You are the Judge :)




USEFUL INFO


Some from u/udecker - Tether co-founder


Tether.to is who has the backing for the token, not Bitfinex. Bitfinex is a customer of Tether. If Bitfinex wants more Tether, they make a request to Tether, just like all other Tether customers. Tether waits for USD to show up, and when it does, creates the necessary tethers and credits Bitfinex. They both have Tawainese banking so money can flow back and forth easily. (The banking industry in the country of Taiwan are under scrutiny lately because of larger legal issues not involving crypto, but clearly affecting crypto companies)


https://wallet.tether.to/transparency


Tether wasn’t designed to be a profit machine. It was designed to be a utility for the crypto community to provide a stable token (with all the benefits of this).
Tether’s business model is this:
1. Generate fees from wire deposits and withdrawals and conversions.
2. Interest income on the reserve.


Bitfinex’s parent company owns a 20% stake in Tether.


People say Tether isn’t being burned. But they are being recycled which is/was always an option.





I hope we can have a productive conversation around this without the usual Gox 2.0, sell it all, Bitfinex is the anti-christ comments with no substance.
Give us your opinion and perspective because maybe I am missing something… but, maybe you are too.



This was quite time consuming (just ask my kids and boss, lol) So if you found this info helpful you can donate if you’d like here, if not, no biggie smalls :)

USDT,CryptoMarkets,Tether’s Circulating Supply Reduced by $7 Billion in a Week,"Following the latest drama with UST and other stablecoins, USDT has seen a sizeable reduction in its overall circulating supply.

Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin by market capitalization USDT, has seen a reduction in the asset’s circulating supply after investors withdrew over $7 billion from it.

The development came shortly after USDT briefly lost its peg to the US dollar on some exchanges, dropping to $0.96 in the wake of the Terra UST saga. Although USDT has regained its dollar parity on trading platforms, investors seemed to have lost some confidence following a withdrawal of $7 billion from the stablecoin.

Tether’s stablecoin reserve has come under criticism, with arguments as to whether USDT is indeed backed 1:1 to the US dollar. However, it is very important to note that Tether’s CTO confirmed on multiple occasions that the company backing USDT – Tether – continued redeeming the stablecoin at its value ($1), meaning that the peg remained unfazed.

What is your opinion on this situation? Did you lose confidence in [USDT](https://swapzone.io/currencies/tether)?

USDT,CryptoMarkets,Tether - Playing Out the Worst Case Scenario,"The anxiety over Tether seems to be growing in the past 10 days or so, and there are multiple threads discussing what would actually happen if Tether loses its $1.00 +/- $0.001 peg. I tried to play it out, but I encourage people to pick this apart or offer alternatives.

1. In a given day in the last month, $100B USDT changes hands (out of $60B in existence, so the average USDT changes hands 1.67 times a day). $61B is the lowest day I found, and $212B the highest.

2a) If it loses its peg (probably anything below $0.98), very few people would buy it directly. Maybe it goes back to $1.00 and you make 2.0X%, but if it crashes you stand to lose everything. That's high-risk, low-reward. You won't be able to convert it to cash.

2b) If it loses its peg and you're holding it, your best bet will be to immediately use a USDT/CRYPTO pair to off-load it before it drops further. Anyone who left orders on the books will be stuck holding the diminished USDT. Maybe it goes back to $1.00 and no harm done. Maybe it keeps dropping...

3) Everyone plays pass the bag until the last USDT trading pairs are either halted by exchanges or people scramble to a workstation and cancel all their open orders.

4) Every $0.10 in USDT drop is $6B wiped off the books. If it goes to $0, that's $60B wiped off the books. That, in and of itself, is a Friday afternoon in crypto world. No big deal.

5) This is the unpredictable part: I think there would be a run on exchanges. If all the exchanges are on the up-and-up and they're only matching makers and takers, that shouldn't be a problem. The order books will dry up until the panic subsides, the prices might look wonky due to lack of volume, and there might be cross-exchange arbitrage opportunities (i.e., today DOT was $16.50 most everywhere except Coinbase Pro, where it was $18.50 - in part I think this is because DOT was only recently listed on Coinbase Pro and people were unwilling to sell what they just bought into a falling market). BUT, as long as there really are 100,000,000 ADA to cover the 100,000,000 ADA people have in exchange accounts, there is no problem.

6) IF, however, some exchanges are trying to double-deal with users' holdings, they'll collapse in the event of a bank run. For example, let's say Kraken assumes that the worst case scenario is that 50% of all ADA is pulled off the exchange in a given day. So it uses 50% of the ADA it is holding in users' accounts as collateral in some exotic lending arrangements. One day people try to pull 60% of their ADA off the exchange at the same time. The exchange can't meet the redemption and it falls apart. There are probably other leverage scenarios I don't fully understand where a bank run causes more people to want to pull their crypto than the exchange has liquid to give.

7) If one or more exchanges collapse in this way, we get massive panic and outflows. Sellers outnumber willing buyers by a multiple, and the prices appear to collapse as the sellers take whatever they can get.

8) Crypto winter until people start feeling like they can safely re-enter the water. How long does that take? Do we get back to $1.5T market cap? $2.5T? $5.0T? Or do the institutional players and crypto newcomers have too much scar tissue and trauma to ever return.

Please pick this apart.",5,2021-06-22 04:05:06,10

Tether’s positive, albeit limited performance last week also indicates that users are buying into the token.But increasing USDT accumulation has several implications for the crypto market. The two most likely scenarios are:

* Volatility set to rise 
* Safe haven seekers are piling into USDT

USDT,CryptoMarkets,"Tether, Bitfinex and Evergrande…","I need some crypto mechanics, guys and gals who are so involved in crypto and investing that they can give some good advice on the subject of this post.

First, almost 75% of all BTC transactions nowadays are initially purchased using Tether (USDT), the 4th largest crypto by market cap sitting at roughly $70 billion dollars as of this posting.

Originally, Tether was said to be backed 1:1 with US Dollars, in other words, every Tether coin minted was backed by a  US dollar being held in reserve. 

That is not the case anymore, we have learned that Tether is only backed by 10% cash reserves the rest is backed by US Dollar “equivalents!” Almost 50% of that backing, roughly $35 billion is backed by commercial paper, and that commercial paper is almost surely Chinese commercial paper, because the Tether creators “will not” disclose whose paper they hold! 

Mind you, Tether is connected to Bitfinex crypto exchange. The people that created Bitfinex are the same people that created Tether, they actually used a loan from one company to the other to help a serious financial issue Bitfinex was having.

Now, Bitfinex is pretty shady, and their ownership are the people that own Tether, let that sink in….

Now, on to a second issue. We have Evergrande, China’s second largest real estate company teetering on the edge of collapse and the gov’t has said that they WILL NOT bail them out. This compounded on top of an already shaky bond market in China…

If Evergrande goes under it will have repercussions in the entire Chinese money system, and all markets will be affected! Stocks, bonds, debt and crypto!

So, let’s recap, Tether is 50% backed by (assumption) Chinese commercial paper, and owned and operated by shady Bitfinex characters that have already broke their trust by only having 10% US dollar reserves for every Tether in circulation. This same Tether is connected to almost 75% of all Bitcoin transactions over the world…

The Chinese bond market and their 2nd largest real estate company is on very shaky ground….

Here is my question to the mystical crypto Gods…..

What can we do to hedge against a fallout in the event that Tether were to fail and hurt not only the entire crypto market but other markets as well. 

What investments in crypto do you think would be shielded from , or have less risk if this event if it were to occur? 

I know people do not have a crystal ball, but I have been wrapping my head around this for about 5 days now and I have run out of mental power to see a clear path through this potential risk. The whole thing is so complex with many moving parts I was hoping that any ideas might help us all brainstorm some inventive solutions for our own protection!

USDT,CryptoMarkets,PSA: USDT (Tether) is an Altcoin and a Trap,"The following is my explanation of the recent posts on bitfinex and USDT.

* 

Your USDT are worth at most $1 each only as long as people are willing to pay you for it. Your USDT will never be worth more than $1, as Tether Corp will release more USDT as demand increases. However, if no one wants tether, then each USDT can become worth a lot less than $1...UNLESS Tether Corporation buys back their USDT, which they have never appreciably done before and likely will never do, because they already have your REAL FIAT USD money in exchange for an ALTcoin with no technology, no speculative value, no place in the amazing world of sparkly blockchain crypto future. **USDT is simply monopoly money masquerading as fiat currency, and therefore completely out of place in true cryptospace.**

* 

In the *bestest* of scenarios, if you are holding USDT, you are simply holding the equivalent amount of USD (along with what that entails including inflation) **but WITHOUT the security of being able to actually use it/trade it in real life** like you would USD. And I think time will tell that actually, if you own USDT, you are holding the ""hot potato"" - the proverbial ticking time bomb. Things are fine now because the music is playing and most people are a bit clueless as to everything that's happening in cryptospace. But whenever that ""music stops"" and people wise up, I want to warn you that you don't want to be holding USDT. That music stops when enough people and exchanges realize that USDT is just another altcoin that will never increase in speculative value (unlike other altcoins) and is artificially being used to increase bitcoin price. People will then realize they should stop buying bitcoin at USDT prices with their USDs. Bitcoin will drop to its true fiat value, whatever that may be. Anyone holding USDT will now be competing against other USDT holders to buy back bitcoin at higher than USD prices. And the moment this happens, USDT becomes un-coupled from USD, faith in USDT disappears, and this house of cards falls apart. **Bottomline: USDT holders will lose a lot of money before this is over. For now, my advice is, if you own USDT, move it into bitcoin at a loss (because I know almost all of you current USDT holders sold your bitcoin lower than where it is now, because USDT were used to buy your bitcoins), or move it into stable altcoins, like Monero or Ethereum which have mostly maintained their USD value and have not been artificially raised by USDT yet and therefore are still at pre-inflated values, unlike bitcoin.**",10,2017-08-18 14:26:13,17

USDT,CryptoMarkets,"Curve DAO has rolled out a Tri Crypto token pool, hosting Ethereum, WBTC and USDT with DeFi’s deepest liquidity thats why its price surge last week","Curve, a decentralized exchange, shipped its latest offering, in the form of Tri Crypto token pool, on Tuesday. Curve DAOs pool hosts Ethereum, WBTC and USDT and its launch triggered a rally in CRV and CVX prices. 

Through the new liquidity pool, traders can earn double the benefits from their Ether holdings, providing liquidity first to the TriCrypto pool and then deposit the TriCrypto LP token in a different pool. 

## How to earn double benefits from Ether in Curve DAOs new pool

Decentralized crypto exchange **Curve’s** TriCrypto Pool doubles the benefit for Ether holders through its TriCrypto pool. The latest product offering was shipped on April 25 and it hosts three assets- Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and USD Tether (USDT). 

Ethereum holders can provide liquidity in the TriCrypto Pool and use the TriCrypto LP to provide liquidity in another pool, TriCrypto-stETH pool for instance. This doubles the gains for users holding Ether, opening up opportunities to earn higher income from liquidity pools. 

The rollout of the pool has triggered a rally in **Curve DAO** (CRV) and Convex Finance (CVX) tokens. Both assets have yielded upwards of 5% gains for holders since Tuesday, based on data from CoinGecko. 

## Curve beats Uniswap through its new liquidity pool

Curve’s competitor Uniswap pairs tokens with **Ethereum** and reduces the volatility associated with price movements, making trade and earning yield easier for users.

USDT,CryptoMarkets,The Big Flippening Between the USDT and USDC Is Getting Closer and Could Occur As Early As October 2022. The USDT/USDC ratio has fallen from 1.83 at the end of 2021 to 1.22 today.,"At the end of 2021, some were already imagining that a flippening between the USDT and the USDC would occur in the future. At that time, the balance of power was still largely in favor of the USDT with a market cap of $76B at the end of 2021, against $41B for the USDC.

The Bear Market that we have been experiencing since the beginning of 2022 has clearly changed the situation. Even more so the total bankruptcy of the UST. Since the bankruptcy of the UST, the USDT has seen its market cap fall by almost 20%, while the USDC has increased by 15%.

The USDT/USDC ratio which was 1.83 at the end of 2021 is now 1.22:

https://preview.redd.it/3ybosmtsyvf91.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=1597e3bece81c22ad7d32c236d9b557fdf92334f

The trend is clearly towards a flippening by the end of 2022. The USDT is finally paying for all the controversy surrounding it for years. Rightly or wrongly, but in a fearful market environment, everyone wants more security:

https://preview.redd.it/unvofqhnyvf91.png?width=1054&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a21564a843d27a1020d1895dfcc72f6cf15acad

USDC gives more security with third-party audited accounts which Tether has always refused to do.

As this big flippening is approaching and Arcane Research is even announcing it around October 10, 2022, rumors about a possible bankruptcy of USDC and Circle have been appearing since the beginning of July 2022. Circle denied this by publishing its accounts to silence the rumors, but as always, rumors are always difficult to extinguish.

In light of this possible flippening, the big question is: who would have an interest in spreading these rumors to prevent the flippening from taking place?

What do you think? Is this flippening inevitable? Have you already chosen the USDC for a long time or do you continue to trust the USDT whose trading volumes are still much higher (it should be noted)?",5,2022-08-05 12:09:06,6

USDT,CryptoMarkets,Seascape.network the STEAM of DeFi...20x potential. Ticker: CWS/USDT on MXC.com,"Many of you have been waiting ages for my next investment call, and I've worked very hard to make sure I do not disappoint! Feel free to share my DD in any other subreddit or social media platform to raise awareness.

KEY DETAILS: CWS/USDT ([https://www.seascape.network/](https://www.seascape.network/))

**24h Trading Volume on MXC:** only 87,603 USDT

**24h Trading Range:** $25-$28.267

**Market Cap:** $26m (Audius was $27m when I first called them, it hit an ATH of $580m)

**Investors:** Binance, LD Capital, Paka, Spark Digital Capital, Nabais Capital, M6, DU Capital, JRR Capital.

**Partners:** Chainlink, Moonbeam, Opensea, Maker, Binance Smart Chain, Matic, Treasureland etc...

I got in at $25 today for $25k so far invested. Seeking price target of $500 (20x on $26m mcap to $520m in less than 8 weeks). Likely they will be listed on Binance around $125m mcap or sooner. It's Alt Season now so they *may* increase quicker OR ath may be higher OR both. Remember Audius took nearly 4 weeks to double from my 22 cent call then it exploded to $4.99. Price increases are not linear.

Recall, I developed a deep learning assisted bot to search the internet and work out which of these 1000s of silly coins will gain. CWS/USDT also popped up as another prime candidate gaining the traction metrics leading to organic big gains over the next few months. Add in a coordinated HODL at this volume level and you have a 20x-er. Untouched it has reached $50 by itself, **uncorrelated** generally to BTC, so its a prime alt season huge upswing candidate. Technicals also show a quick fib retracement to $50 within the next 2 weeks or sooner with good buying activity. No one was keeping track of what I said with Audius, this time, it may be different?

**Special Considerations:** Becoming the STEAM game distribution platform for DeFi is a much more realistic proposition than becoming a massive AAA-game developer such as the Activision of DeFi, we are years away from seeing anything like that. I've overseen game production in my past and it's a tough business! Delays happen all the time, and its ends up being expensive and taking much longer than anticipated (even if you x2 or x3 your most conservative time length expectations). Mu**ch better to be the picker and chooser of great games.** I also have contacts at Supercell (who made the great Clash of Clans) and I will hook these guys up. I spent the last few days talking to the founder of Seascape and drilled him for information and believe they are on the right track.

Like Audius, this is a coin with a website that the GENERAL PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND with a product that can be used now, granted they only have a few games, they are developing their blockchain to make it very cost effective and scalable for much bigger game titles to use them as their **in-game coin economy** partner, even if they have better distribution than seascape now. Seascape is an **in-game economy technology partner first and foremost. They are doing the hard stuff, unlike Ultra, so that they later this year become the distribution partner of choice for DeFi game titles.** Ultra is just steam with tokens and they are already around $250m market cap right now, so you see, Seascape could blow them out of the water!

**SEE BELOW FOR COMPETITOR ANALYSIS for when Seascape was JUST $528k mcap** at a $10m private investor valuation (when they first listed - they caught up to that private investor valuation within weeks and that was picked up by my crypto bot - very sorry for the few weeks lag, my bot still needs to crunch data, still working out how to find gems right when they first list but that's an extremely hard thing to do!!)

However, as with Audius, I hope another 20x is good enough, BUT I picked this up much sooner than Audius after listing so 30x is my hopium target although I don't want to be too bold. I am seeking $750 take profit if this one keeps rising strongly after surpassing $500.

NFTs: 25,000 NFTs minted on BSC and millions of dollars dropped to users through their LP mining game. Increase in its NFT economy alone could add an extra $50m-$100m to its mcap over the next few months.

**Notes:**

pCWS is the bridged version of CWS (the currency of Seascape on ETH) on BSC (Binance Smart Chain). Users can bridge from ETH to BSC using poly.network bridge. 1 CWS = 1 pCWS as they are completely interchangeable.

**High number of coins in a few wallets:** Audius had a similar position where 84% of coins were held in 2 wallets. Seascape's token release schedule is structured to cause growth in their ecosystem and corresponding growth in their price to mitigate future inflation effects. Essentially new games will be backed by newly released CWS acting as collateral for newly minted game coin economies generated on the Seascape blockchain. This means, as a new game grows its user base and its in game economy grows in value, those additionally released CWS should in effect pay for themselves mitigating inflation effects. Interestingly, Audius had a similar reason for releasing new coins, i.e. to attract new artists, and it grew from $27m mcap to an ath of $580m.",48,2021-04-11 01:34:18,1

USDT,CryptoMarkets,"Without that, could crypto really move forward?","Honestly, I think we’re finally getting closer to mass adoption of crypto as a payment method. The main barrier, for the longest time, has been the lack of practical ways to spend directly in crypto. Personally, since 2021, I’ve barely used a bank account or card for online payments because the fees are just... insane! But recently, for some subscriptions, I had to try out Redotepay. It’s okay, but when I go through Google Pay, it costs me $12 in the mobil App instead of $8 directly on  site web for my X premium. Why the price difference? Who knows.

As for Bitget Pay, it could actually be a solid alternative. No transaction fees, fast, convenient... sounds better than Google Pay or Apple Pay for regular payments, especially without extra fees. But for now, it’s limited to BTC, ETH, and USDT. It’d be even better if they added TON and TRX.

Anyway, if you guys know of other ways to pay with crypto without having to throw away money on fees, let me know in the comments! Because paying $12 instead of $8 each month... that stings.",11,2024-11-04 09:54:05,73

USDT,CryptoMarkets,PSA: USDT (Tether) is an Altcoin and a Trap,"The following is my explanation of the recent posts on bitfinex and USDT.

* 

Your USDT are worth at most $1 each only as long as people are willing to pay you for it. Your USDT will never be worth more than $1, as Tether Corp will release more USDT as demand increases. However, if no one wants tether, then each USDT can become worth a lot less than $1...UNLESS Tether Corporation buys back their USDT, which they have never appreciably done before and likely will never do, because they already have your REAL FIAT USD money in exchange for an ALTcoin with no technology, no speculative value, no place in the amazing world of sparkly blockchain crypto future. **USDT is simply monopoly money masquerading as fiat currency, and therefore completely out of place in true cryptospace.**

* 

In the *bestest* of scenarios, if you are holding USDT, you are simply holding the equivalent amount of USD (along with what that entails including inflation) **but WITHOUT the security of being able to actually use it/trade it in real life** like you would USD. And I think time will tell that actually, if you own USDT, you are holding the ""hot potato"" - the proverbial ticking time bomb. Things are fine now because the music is playing and most people are a bit clueless as to everything that's happening in cryptospace. But whenever that ""music stops"" and people wise up, I want to warn you that you don't want to be holding USDT. That music stops when enough people and exchanges realize that USDT is just another altcoin that will never increase in speculative value (unlike other altcoins) and is artificially being used to increase bitcoin price. People will then realize they should stop buying bitcoin at USDT prices with their USDs. Bitcoin will drop to its true fiat value, whatever that may be. Anyone holding USDT will now be competing against other USDT holders to buy back bitcoin at higher than USD prices. And the moment this happens, USDT becomes un-coupled from USD, faith in USDT disappears, and this house of cards falls apart. **Bottomline: USDT holders will lose a lot of money before this is over. For now, my advice is, if you own USDT, move it into bitcoin at a loss (because I know almost all of you current USDT holders sold your bitcoin lower than where it is now, because USDT were used to buy your bitcoins), or move it into stable altcoins, like Monero or Ethereum which have mostly maintained their USD value and have not been artificially raised by USDT yet and therefore are still at pre-inflated values, unlike bitcoin.**",9,2017-08-18 14:26:13,17

It seems like a **contracting triangle pattern is forming** on the 4-hour chart of the [DOT USD pair](https://cryptopurview.com/polkadot-dot-usdt-price-live-chart/). A break from the upper side of the triangle and a 50% Fib retracement level at 34.40 could bring a fresh increase for the [Polkadot DOT USD pair](https://cryptopurview.com/polkadot-dot-usdt-price-live-chart/). The next key resistance is at $38.9. If the momentum succeeds to break above the $38.9, the [DOT USD price](https://cryptopurview.com/polkadot-dot-usdt-price-live-chart/) could push higher towards $42-$45.

USDT,Bitcoin,Tether was hacked by the same person who hacked Bitstamp in 2015 (x-post /r/cryptocurrency),"Decided to have a look at what we could learn about the Tether hack from the blockchain, the coins are still moving around so I may edit this later as this develops.

It actually starts with this wallet here:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/12f4885dad525cc1

Look familiar? Go to the last page, that was the wallet used to steal 19000BTC from Bitstamp back in January 2015 (and which was still receiving coins from Bitstamp as recently as September, well done guys).

This wallet made two transactions, the first is fairly innocuous but I'll come back to it later:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/7b46c7e412b1f1e93ff0aa67232457dde3fb6e91f4c61e025a97e56290049050

This address then sends out a further 0.01BTC:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1LBQpqUTEmdPTH8adaV6xS8KQt6FGCD3xD

The following morning it sends 0.01 to the address that was several hours later used to empty the Tether wallet:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

I'm not quite sure why they would make a deposit like this to it hours before - perhaps to test that everything is working?

*Edit: I believe this was actually to ensure they had BTC for transaction fees moving the tethers around*

At 10:53, the wallet makes several transactions transferring 23 million tethers from the tether wallet:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

Then at 11:10 they transfer another 7.9 million tethers. A further 50,000 tethers are transferred over at 11:54.

At 12:01, 5BTC (the bulk of the bitcoin in the tether wallet) is transferred over to the same address:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/e7e09cd092a5febdcae6b2ec76b06389c29298ed237dd1f210e1e54f096f1f92

These tethers are then transferred over to the address in the Tether announcement as their relevant blocks are confirmed.

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r

The 5BTC is also transferred to this address in amounts of roughly 1BTC per transaction:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

Following the BTC along, you arrive back at an address from before, which is confirmed to be part of the wallet holding the stolen Tether:

https://blockchain.info/tx/eeaf8b9c6288c28c481d6e37d687b5c42b0222fb3d8a73bdca81c1a12243c579

It's worth noting that this same address was just used to create an Omni token called lioncoin:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupsp.aspx?sp=2147484016

The BTC from the tether wallet ended up in these addresses:

https://blockchain.info/address/1HtmVRdFRqPScH7Ud6UFR6HUcndksjVmua

https://blockchain.info/address/155KG55pRsV1Y9jdwwynfGHGqR9cqPKToB

https://blockchain.info/address/1M8b8BNMEMFFem9UQpZydoespHzXjAnC9t

I will update this post as more develops.

*Edit 1*

This wallet from the Tether and Bitstamp hacks seems to be owned by the same person who took 12000BTC from Huobi in late 2015, interesting...

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d

*Edit: Huobi are saying this is not a hack, so who knows why 12000 or so bitcoin was withdrawn from their exchange and combined with the coins from bitstamp [see here](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d) before being passed through several more wallets and onto BTC-e in batches of 1000 or so.*

Before he was taking thousands of BTC off exchanges and sending it to BTC-e, he also used to sell much smaller amounts on Localbitcoins.

So Localbitcoins guys, if you have a log of who was using [this address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1EvTV4ySZbwwsRfL6T723cg1iiFASJbqH3) back in 2015, you've got the hacker ;)

*Edit 2*

So I was [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7eho5y/tether_was_hacked_by_the_same_person_who_hacked/dq558sd/) whether this could be an inside job.

Well, maybe? I don't think there's enough evidence from chain analysis alone to draw a conclusion.

Some of the transactions which funded the lioncoin address came from an old Bitfinex wallet, and [some came from the bitstamp hack address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/6b1a2139799a82b8). Bear in mind that this is [part of the same wallet](https://blockchain.info/tx/eeaf8b9c6288c28c481d6e37d687b5c42b0222fb3d8a73bdca81c1a12243c579) that the stolen tethers were sent to.

Also if you look at the [tether address](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=3BbDtxBSjgfTRxaBUgR2JACWRukLKtZdiQ&page=1) you'll notice that when other blocks of tether were released they were quickly transferred to the Bitfinex wallet, with this 30 million being the exception, that said in prior months they had regularly left millions of tether in this address for days at a time, so this isn't necessarily a red flag.

It could be that the attacker had access to the main tether issuance address (3MbYQMM etc) or it may just be that they noticed the 30 million tethers sat on the wallet that they could manipulate. Presumably Tether know whether or not they intended to make [this](https://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=dbde10653dd7f459260c11e2a80ae887f7c72e5bfd22f5d908b489dd430be764) transaction. Without knowing that we can only speculate on whether the compromise went beyond the address that was emptied.

*Edit 3*

There is a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tether/comments/7ei568/tether_return/) in which a /u/bitconexfoier1 claims to have bought 10M tethers, and provides an address that [received 10 million tethers](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=13kyHqsbtZpRHDNSdXWniJiCZPvRtMjVao) (now invalid) from the hackers.

One very plausible explanation of the new tethers could be the borrowed money from banks. Which means they are offering amazing rates to banks, and banks realizing the profits are lending them the money. Since finnex has no banking they have a perfect situation where no one can actually ""cash in"" tethers against the borrowed amount. 

It really is getting a bit suspicious how much tether is being printed without banking.

Glad if a trusted member can offer to hold the funds.

**How I send mistakenly 1 BTC to the Huobi Cold Wallet?**

A day I was watching a BTC rich list and exploring the addresses. I'm unsure how exactly it happens because I verified the address, but when I sent 1 BTC I did mistakenly to the wrong address!!! I verified that I was sending to the correct address, but I had to remake the sendship because the wallet crashed, probably there was the problem, the huobi's cold wallet address was in the clipboard. Anyways I don't have certainty how it happens.List:  [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)

It was a mistake, I work often sending and receiving BTC. When you do a certain task all the days copying wrong data could be a **TERRIBLE** but **EASY** mistake to do, because we are humans and we fall in the trust. **As you did a task correctly many many times you earn trust on yourself and try save time.** If it didn't happens to you ever you aren't being honest.

**7 months talking with Huobi Customer Support (part 1)**

I tried to contact Huobi's customer support. First they first didn't understand me, thinking that I tried to deposit on Huobi and sent to a wrong address. After they understand they told me that the address doesn't belongs to Huobi and they can't help me. That is false, I did an investigation and they have direct relation with this address, they can help me. Read my following analysis please:

&#x200B;

**Huobi Ownership Analysis**

Searching, sites says that the address belongs to Huobi Huobi support says that address doesn't belongs to Huobi

I don't know if belongs to Huobi or not, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi

Why? The address 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 regulary sent big amounts to 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D

Then, is VERY PROBABLY THAT 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 OWNER KNOWS 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D OWNER And the 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D OWNER can help me.

Searching, some sites (and sites like USDT Official page [https://web.archive.org/web/20181113185656/https://wallet.tether.to/richlist](https://web.archive.org/web/20181113185656/https://wallet.tether.to/richlist)) says that the address 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D belongs to Huobi

Again, I don't know really if the address is of Huobi, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi

Why? On my Huobi account I made only 2 BTC withdraws from Huobi in the past

2018-05-08 18:36:45 , txid: 0e6bf02323ebc166b6638afcd6170ecb73948748235e687def7e7a3cb1902fca , it has 239 inputs 2018-05-08 20:17:10 , txid: b59b988d642fe3773268e246ef1a0d048bbd3f734a611d00722b39126ed9e20b , it has 239 inputs too

In both transaction, all inputs are addresses that BELONGS TO HUOBI, because you huobi are sending me BTC

Both transactions has 39 addresses as inputs in common (all huobi address, maybe deposit addresses of anothers huobi users)

**7 months talking with Huobi Customer Support (part 2)**

After understanding this , they asked me my consent to pay a fee. I agreed. After they asked me sign a message with my privates keys. I did it. And finally they tell me ""Wait"". I'm waiting 7 months ago, all months I ask and they ever reply the same ""We will contact you"". Now they told me "" Hello，sorry for the inconvenience, we feedback your problem to our technology department.  After a series of research and development, but it can not be solved.  Please understand this.  ""

I want to think that the team is failing and Huobi isn't wanting steal my BTC. What they are doing maybe could be illegal. I'm thinking to talk with lawers on Singapore, I don't know what more to do.

I tried to contact the CEO Livio on Twitter ( [https://twitter.com/livio\_huobi](https://twitter.com/livio_huobi) ) but they don't reply me! I want to think that someone else is administering their account.

USDT,Bitcoin,"I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox. Ask me anything.","Dear community,

Many of you know or remember me, especially recently since the MtGox bankruptcy has been allegedly linked with Bitcoin price drops in December 2017 to February 2018. Since taking over the most active Bitcoin exchange in 2011, I ran MtGox until filing for civil rehabilitation on February 28th 2014 (which became bankruptcy less than 2 months later) because a large amount of Bitcoins went missing. Since then, four years have passed, and MtGox is still in bankruptcy today. I’ve been arrested, released under bail after a little less than one year, and am now trying to assist MtGox getting into civil rehabilitation.

I did my best trying to grow the ecosystem by running the biggest exchange at the time. It had big problems but still managed to hang in there. For a while. A quite long while, even, while the rest of the ecosystem caught up. At the end of the day, the methods I chose to try to get MtGox out of its trouble ended up being insufficient, insufficiently executed, or plain wrong.

I know I didn't handle the last, stressful days of the outdrawn and painful Gox collapse very well. I can only be humble about that in hindsight. Once again, I’m sorry.

Japanese bankruptcy law has a particularly nasty outcome here, and I want to address this up front. As creditors claims were registered, those claims were registered in the valuation of Japanese Yen on the bankruptcy date. That's the only way Japanese bankruptcy law can work (most bankruptcy laws around the world operate this way for that matter). This means that the claims can be paid back in full, and there will still be over 160,000 bitcoin and bitcoin cash in assets in the Gox estate. The way bankruptcy law works is that if there are any assets remaining after the creditors have been paid in full, then those assets are distributed to shareholders as part of the liquidation.

That's the only way any bankruptcy law can reasonably work. And yet, in this case, it produces an egregiously distasteful outcome in that the shareholders of MtGox would walk away with the value of over 160,000 bitcoin as a result of what happened.

I don't want this. I don't want this billion dollars. From day one I never expected to receive anything from this bankruptcy. The fact that today this is a possibility is an aberration and I believe it is my responsibility to make sure it doesn’t happen. One of the ways to do this would be civil rehabilitation, and as it seems most creditors agree with this, I am doing my best to help make it happen. I do not want to become instantly rich. I do not ask for forgiveness. I just want to see this end as soon as possible with everyone receiving their share of what they had on MtGox so everyone, myself included, can get some closure.

I’m an engineer at heart. I want to build things. I like seeing what I build being useful, and people being happy using what I build. My drive, from day one, has been to push the limits of what is technically possible, and this is the main reason I liked and have been involved with Bitcoin in the first place. When I took over MtGox, I never imagined things would end this way and I am forever sorry for everything that’s taken place and all the effect it had on everyone involved.

Hopefully, I can make what I’ve learned in this experience useful to the community as a whole, so there can at least be something positive in the end.

Ask me anything you like.

**EDIT**: With this coming to r/all there have been an overwhelming number of messages, questions etc. I will continue responding for a little while but probably won't be able to respond to new questions (it is starting to be late here and I've been spending the last few hours typing).

USDT,Bitcoin,Due Diligence on Bitcoin,"Hi everyone,

I've been trying to evaluate on my own whether bitcoin is worth buying and holding long term and wanted to present to you some basic findings. This is not financial advice but my own research analysis and I am open to being corrected as I am still new. I see a lot of DD for stocks but not as much here so I am hoping we can also get some more quality content here to share knowledge. I am someone who has bought and sold bitcoin at a loss back in 2017-2018, and then again 2020-2021. Yes, I saw all the ""HODL"" posts, but I was only in it for attempted financial gain. I've only recently spent the time to look into bitcoin and become a believer.

**Supply**: First, Bitcoin has a fixed supply. Right now there are 900 bitcoins mined per day. Every four years the number of Bitcoins produced per block (created every 10 minutes) are cut in half. Currently the mining reward is 6.25 Bitcoin per block. In 2024 it will drop to 3.125 BTC per block. So we are beginning to see something we learned in our high school Economics class called Scarcity.

[https:\/\/institutional.fidelity.com\/app\/literature\/item\/9901337.html?pos=T](https://preview.redd.it/xqveh5ei8vk61.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&s=eff083c195e1aa24ede9ce998708f1d2c0f53f83)

**Demand**: Next is demand. It doesn't matter if there's less of a resource no one wants. There is a lot to look at here (i.e. Bitcoin ATM installations increased by +85% in 2020 to 11,798 terminals, outpacing the previous year’s near +50% rise by a significant margin, according to data source Coin ATM Radar). But the big one we are all most excited about is the change in institutional money flowing in. For those that don't know Metcalfe’s Law, it holds that as the number of its users grows linearly, a network’s value (or, by inference, the bitcoin price) grows geometrically. In other words, there is a cascading effect where more and more institutions begin exponentially buying in *worldwide*. Right now 30% of all U.S. buyers are institutions. This is a big deal because institutions have more money than you, and that means if they keep buying, our clock window to buy at our current price is now ticking.

[https:\/\/ir.citi.com\/peFJTnzeEoMSIAEFlwH12VeM5d&#37;2BCckWNrsO9lxpmyWezrz5V&#37;2Bx&#37;2FfRvm0gv6cWRpDHGWtIk7sTME&#37;3D](https://preview.redd.it/wc54qsbk7vk61.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=b468d4499be43c05390432d4e0bd7a578b79d0b7)

**Indicators**: The first decade was marked by speculation and pushback. And Bitcoin prices reflected that. I know for a lot of us, me included, we want indicators to show that prices will go up. But something I'd like to propose for your consideration also: The maturation of an ecosystem tends to result in fresh consolidation. Because we are still in a stage of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD), this is good news for you - it means we are only now beginning to exit the early adaptor stage. It's not too late to buy. As more and more people have bitcoin, it will begin its slow inevitable march towards mainstream as a dependable store of value. This is why the next chart I want to show you is not just money, but people. More and more people are bitcoin owners. More and more people start talking and googling and investing. Metcalfe’s Law, remember?

**Inflation/Depreciation**: When I was a kid I remember reading a book called ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" where the premise was to put your money in assets that make more money, not less. Putting your money in things that depreciate (i.e. a car) loses you money over time, while things that appreciate (i.e. a house) make more money. A popular Bitcoin valuation chart is called the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) pricing model. Notice how as Bitcoin becomes more scarce due to halving's, it exponentially grows. Next, notice how your hard earned U.S. Dollar has depreciated by 99% the past hundred years to gold, which has been traditionally the ""gold standard"" of storage. Guys, this is seriously starting to look like a no brainer to me.

**Regulation**: This something not completely known to any of us. Despite the price volatility, what if the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Securities or Exchange Commission (SEC) tried to in some way limit or outright ban Bitcoin? I take comfort that institutions are adopting and even big retail investors are adding Bitcoin as part of their overall asset portfolio. Regulation is not always bad and can provide us a layer security from a ""Mt. Gox"" happening to us again. There is a stable coin called Tether that is being investigated and other legitimate FUD concerns. But with Coinbase's soon IPO, and large positions on the news from the likes of Tesla, there is more safety and certainty. Do understand that your faith is currently paid to you at a premium. Once all FUD and volatility from Bitcoin is removed, it's skyrocketing price will reflect that.

[In December 2020, the SEC announced they would allow “crypto-focused broker-dealers to operate for five years without fear of an enforcement action provided that they can verify if they have possession and control of customers’ digital asset securities https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/rules\/policy\/2020\/34-90788.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/gfyk4m81mvk61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=a957eec2e5367ad36acf68cd26e6d320f9818477)

**Competition**: Cryptocurrency is not just limited to Bitcoin, there are many ""altcoins."" But analysts have been pointing to Bitcoin as the ""north star"" of all other cryptocurrencies and welcome mainstream adaption of cryptocurrencies as a portfolio diversifier. Bitcoin helps illuminate the financial industry’s path. There are new technologies and advancements being made too for the ""inefficiencies"" of Bitcoin. Efforts to improve Bitcoin’s processing speed are underway such as a new scaling technology called the Lightning Network.

[https:\/\/ir.citi.com\/peFJTnzeEoMSIAEFlwH12VeM5d&#37;2BCckWNrsO9lxpmyWezrz5V&#37;2Bx&#37;2FfRvm0gv6cWRpDHGWtIk7sTME&#37;3D](https://preview.redd.it/t74wwd7edvk61.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=86efc9bd3a7aaf40556c7d516779594edc53e884)

**Conclusion**: Bitcoin has gone mainstream and is considered a legitimate asset class of digital gold by more and more investors. Bitcoin has a proven supply dynamic (S2F) and demand dynamic (Metcalfe’s Law). With banks printing money to infinity, the question for you is:

*With all this information, is bitcoin worth a portion of your portfolio?*

If your answer is ""*yes*"" then Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) of buying and holding bitcoin appears to be a viable investment. I do not think this is an asset class to sell anymore. Notice nowhere in this writeup did I talk about getting rich quick off bitcoin's prices. I'm a firm believer that ""time in the market beats timing the market,"" and so I will be buying and holding because I believe in the future of bitcoin.

USDT,Bitcoin,You really aren't bullish enough on #Bitcoin ,"By @stackhodler on X

All of your existing models for Bitcoin are based on data that is now completely obsolete.

Where it goes from here is anyone's guess.

Your favorite chart squigglers and quad four enthusiasts are relying on data from a period of time where a TINY fraction of global capital had access to Bitcoin.

Few people realize that everything has now changed.

Historically, Bitcoin has never broken through the 0.618 fibonacci retracement level before the halving.

Well, it just blew the doors right off that level. 

Market timing geniuses are left sobbing into their rapidly devaluing sacks of fiat, desperately hoping for a pull-back.

Let this be a warning.

It's the first of many models to be destroyed now that BlackRock, Fidelity, etc. are laying on the bid 24/7.

Rumor has it OTC desks have setup makeshift boiler rooms to speed dial whales and beg them for sub-$100K BTC.

Meanwhile TRILLIONS in investment capital sits frozen on the sidelines, unable to move for the next 60 days.

Why, you ask?

Registered Investment Advisors have a 90+ day waiting period before they can allocate to new investment products.

RIAs are watching Bitcoin run, twitching like greyhounds in the race traps, waiting to secure a position for their clients.

We are likely going to see RIA inflows hit at the same time as the halving.

Meanwhile, MicroStrategy is rocketing even more than Bitcoin.

It's up 63% in the past 3 months compared to 46% for BTC.

But a MSTR pump is just a delayed Bitcoin pump.

@Saylor will soon be selling more MSTR shares and buying Bitcoin with the proceeds.

But that's not all...

With this performance, there's a chance that MicroStrategy could end up in the S&P500.

If that happens, MSTR will receive 10's of billions in passive flows from index investors.

Much of which will ultimately flow into spot Bitcoin as Saylor continues his genius strategy.

Bottom line: Even the hardcore Vanguard Bogleheads will soon be stacking #Bitcoin  by way of MicroStrategy.

Just one more thing that isn't priced in.

As all of this unfolds, it's important to keep in mind how the Bitcoin price is actually set.

It isn't tethered to earnings, new product developments, etc.

Its price is only limited by the understanding of the people buying and selling.

Some of us understand how scarce it is, and have already priced it at $1 million+ per coin.

If the market suddenly shifted their views towards ours, there's nothing holding BTC back from going to $500K+ virtually overnight.

What could make that happen?

For now, most people still view BTC as a trade.

Not the ultimate asset to accumulate.

But as a thought experiment, imagine if a major nation state like Saudi Arabia made it clear that they were stacking Bitcoin with their profits.

That they aren't looking to trade in and out, but rather create a multi-generational Bitcoin endowment.

Perception would shift drastically overnight.

Who would sell their BTC for a mere $100K when they know Saudi Arabia is going to pour in decades worth of oil profits?

The same shift could happen if corporations, major billionaires, etc. started publicly denominating their success in Bitcoin.

Jeff Bezos just unloaded $4 Billion in Amazon stock a few months after he was seen partying with Michael Saylor in St. Tropez.

Did Saylor orange pill another whale? Who knows.

But one thing's for sure: We're on a knife's edge. 

Only a few headlines away from a shift in perception that would bring drastically higher price levels.

Plan accordingly 🐂",754,2024-02-15 20:32:25,249

USDT,Bitcoin,AMA request: Anyone who's bought/sold Tether directly from Tether since late April.,"With all the China drama I feel like this issue has fallen off the radar a bit, but it occured to me today that I've not actually seen any reports by people who said they'd bought Tether directly. There's statements from Tether/Bitfinex employees who say that they are processing wires for some corporate clients, as well as comments like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6yqeqv/the_truth_about_bitfinex_and_tether/dmqp0q1/) claiming that they have more money coming in every day than going out, but I've tried and failed to find any recent examples of users who say they've either bought or sold Tether directly to/from Tether (as opposed to on Kraken etc).

Given that $120 million in new Tethers were issued in less than two weeks recently, I'm surprised that I couldn't locate any confirmation of anyone actually buying USDT from the issuer.

USDT,Bitcoin,Is Tether an existential threat to Bitcoin?,"As a Bitcoin investor, I owe it to myself to continuously evaluate the threats to this asset therefore I follow most closely its harshest critique. 

At the top of these threats IMO is the price manipulation arising from the issuance of USDT that isn't reflective of demand. Although this was a hot topic in 2017, given that the supply has doubled (+$10B) in the last three months it seems critical to discuss. 

For those curious enough I highly recommend this [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.12903) which provides strong empirical evidence of this manipulation. Moreover, it highlights the interconnectivity of USDT amongst exchanges which provides undeniable evidence on the underlying structure for this manipulation to take place.

On the flip side, I guess these nefarious events are intrinsic to any unregulated financial asset which BTC's past is riddled with. But the billion-dollar question is whether this is an existential threat that could lead to the demise of this amazing innovation.

Curious to hear your ideas, especially if you've taken the time to study it! It's not a pretty topic but we owe it to our wealth to address it head-on.

USDT,Bitcoin,Why Crypto Crashed Today,"My thoughts on why the entire crypto market just tanked... (tl/dr)

The people behind B cash thought that this would be the perfect time to launch a full-scale and highly coordinated attack in it's never ending attempt to become 'the one true bitcoin'. 

1) They had that idiot Swede from bitcoin.com come out and announce on every media outlet he was 'selling all his bitcoin, because it's useless'. 
2) They then began a well orchestrated FUD campaign that included paid click-farm shills posting everywhere about how Bitcoin will crash there's is the better solution... 
3) At the same time Roger, that idiot Swede and others from the Chinese mining groups who collectively hold hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of BTC began dumping just enough to steadily drop the price and reinforce their message... 
4) Add in spamming the network with fake transactions to slow things even more...while shouting ""See, we're right...""

....All timed to be within 24 hours of the Coinbase announcement. 

Clearly a well planned power play and It was clearly successful... (sort of)

Roger Vers and the Swede and the Chinese miners? They all made a shit ton of money. Maybe you did too if you got out in time so who cares right? 

You should care.... this past week was an important week for all crypto as it was the first week of real Wall Street money coming into the market with CME futures (5x bigger btw then CBOE). It was widely known that many investors would be waiting to see how things went, to see if it was too volatile, too manipulated... And guess fucking what? 

Today Ally Financial announced it has changed it's mind and won't allow its 1m+ customers to trade Bitcoin futures.... people are reading about how corrupt the crypto space is with the Coinbase insider trading scandal... and tomorrow morning they will all wake up to read about how it crashed... And they won't seperate out one coin from another... to them it's all the same and Bitcoin is the leader.

So... the truth is we will recover but make no mistake, the bullshit greed war that Roger the fucking felon started has set back the entire market as the 'institutional money; we all hoped would flood in is now saying ""No fucking way""... That and the Roger cartel dumping of BTC in an attempt to get it closer in market share is why we are tanking. 

Now go on, flame me back... I expect it..I'm happy to provide references to all of the above (or you can google it yourself). 

So realize this.. the threat to crypto is not just from governments or Wall Street or some hacker stealing your shit, it's from greed. Greed from within... 

Or maybe not. What the fuck do I know :)

USDT,Bitcoin,"Please understand what ""1 btc = 1 btc"" really means","Often a bitcoiner will say ""1 btc = 1 btc"" and then someone, thinking they are clever, will respond with ""well 1 usd = 1 usd"" - so I'd like to explain the flaw in this response, and I'll use a simple example to do so.

Let's take some constant, like ""1 meter."" The ""meter"" is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second.

Since the speed of light does not change, the length light travels in that time in a vacuum does not change. Therefore, the meter is an unchanging and permanently fixed constant backed by physics and mathematics, i.e. ""1 meter = 1 meter.""

If the speed of light were somehow centrally planned and constantly changing (read: inflating), then 1 meter would not be a reliable and we could not measure length effectively. Buildings could not be built and no one would be able to communicate distance. You can substitute the meter with any other mathematical constant to illustrate the same concept.

Similarly, a ""bitcoin"" can be defined as a single token out of 21 million. Since the cap cannot change, a bitcoin is also a permanently fixed constant backed by physics and cryptography, i.e. ""1 btc = 1 btc.""

The same cannot be said of the dollar, as it is one unit out of a forever increasing total, centrally planned supply. This is similar to the speed of light always changing, messing with the ""meter"" definition and our ability to measure. The changing inconsistency of the dollar leads to distortion in ""measurements"" (read: prices) that is destructive to society - which bitcoin remedies.

It is the first constant in the field of economics. The importance of this can hardly be overstated.

tl;dr: The ""1 btc = 1 btc"" does NOT mean how much a btc is valued in fiat, nor does it indicate how much a bitcoin can buy, nor is it a tongue-in-cheek tautology. It's a phrase indicating the fixed, mathematical, physically-tethered nature of bitcoin.",511,2022-07-17 18:10:56,631

Yes, it will be a disaster for Tether holders but why would it adversely impact BTC or any other coin? If anything, a Tether crash would probably cause a spike in the crypto markets as people will be fleeing to BTC or any other alt that is paired with USDT.

Now there may be a situation where a Tether crash would spook the entire crypto world; but, Tether is just not big enough yet at 2% market cap to cause any major lasting issues. I hope.

Exchanges need to figure out a better and safer way to do what Tether does. In the meantime - I'd probably stay away from it and just hold BTC. just to be on the safe side.",0,2018-01-29 11:11:12,76

Can someone please explain to me how tether inc. is getting away with creating 100,000,000 a day in their play money 

see:https://twitter.com/tetherprinter?lang=enhttps://twitter.com/tetherprinter?lang=en

and using that 'money' that is not redeemable for actual money... to buy Bitcoin and other actual crypto?

This is the most astonishingly obvious and blatant scam I've ever seen in my life bar none 

they goal so many say is that cypto is decenteralized and not controlled by a few.  Yet one company with two branches - the one creating 100s of millions of fake money tether - and the one colluding with it to put that fake money into circulation bitfinex. 

How exactly would tether inc be making 100s of millions of dollars in profit per week to spend on real USD to peg to their tether 'money'  - where is their profit coming from? Getting people to use their fake money that can't be redeemed for real money - is their profit and that's ok with people?

I'm honestly so confused if anyone actually believes tether is a legit company with legit profits that enables them to buy 100,000,000 a day in USD to back their play money with?

Also how is this decenteralized when over 1 billion they've pumped into the crypto market is all controlled by 3 men?

Their website clearly states you can't redeem their play money for real money so why would people be using it? Are you all going to just sit back while they continue to create 100,000,000 a day out of thin are day after day? How long do you think they are going to get away with this blatantly obvious scam?

Every day they continue to be allowed to pump 100,000,000 of fake worthless 'money' into the crypto market - means the more at risk the entire ecosystem is, the harder it could fall and the longer it could take to rise from it.

And the biggest question of all - how is it a legit company that is backed by USD when it can't even do business in the US - one of the largest economies in the world today?",19,2018-01-18 22:49:41,66

EDIT 2: TL:DR - Most negative analysis on this sub lately of Tether are likely from a single biased source that stretches a lot to make his points, and there is simply not enough Tether in the market nor is it concentrated enough to create a catastrophic problem or significant inflation for any USDT currency pair.


Like many of you, I have heard the stories and posts about the fraudulent tether, I trade in this space on many exchanges and the growing concern is worrying, so I did my due diligence, and I would like to share it with the community.


First and most importantly IMO, all this controversy stems from just one account/person. A person on twitter going by the handle @Bitfinexed - https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed 


Here you can see this person's writings - https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/latest


Spoofy, Tethers and institutional investors are what they contend to be the lies and fraud, AND that this entire rally in 2017 is based on fraudulent Tethers and spoofing, and that this will implode the markets.


I feel this is also important… Turns out this person sold at $1000, maybe the real reason he is on this mission??… 
https://twitter.com/whalepool/status/896460700461277185


Now for some troubling info, the majority of this narrative (FUD??) here on Reddit in the last month come from just three accounts.


https://www.reddit.com/user/AtlasRand1/submitted/


https://www.reddit.com/user/cetusfund/submitted/


https://www.reddit.com/user/AnythingForSuccess


As you can see these accounts entire mission is to post constantly about this. They all show up on the other’s post to comment regularly. 


Btw, some people on the pro-finex side think this is a smear campaign from other exchanges. I don’t believe this to be the case. This person(s) only talk about Tether/Finex, yet Tether is used and traded by the $millions daily on 3 of the top 5 exchanges, Finex, Bittrex, Polo, yet never a word about those other exchanges. (Check the USDT volume on other exchanges)
https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/tether/#markets 


Therefore, if it is an exchange, it isn’t Trex/Polo because this would affect them as well. If it was an exchange other than Trex/Polo they would have plenty of fire power against 3 of the top 5 exchanges with Tether fraud.


This leads me to believe it is most likely a sad person(s) with an ax to grind. They might have lost their $ on Finex to what they believe are spoofers/fraud and or they were part of the finex hack and sold there BFX too early. 


Btw I see contention that Bitfinex did NOT pay back the $ from the hack. They did, but some people are mad because they sold BFX early and didn’t recoup full $ amount from haircuts, but that was their decision.

POINTS OF CONTENTION




SPOOFING
This is what set my alarm bells off about these articles I read from Bitfinexed. Specifically spoofing… https://hackernoon.com/meet-spoofy-how-a-single-entity-dominates-the-price-of-bitcoin-39c711d28eb4 


and this nugget…“And who the hell is going to go margin long so dramatically after a huge crash?” from this article… https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/are-fraudulent-tethers-being-used-for-margin-lending-on-bitfinex-5de9dd80f330


Claiming spoofing shows this person has limited markets/trading knowledge. Clearly they haven’t watched an order book of any exchange in crypto, equities, or Forex. 


This is called scalping or scare walls. Again this is done in every market around the globe. 


Here is a professional FOREX trader talking about scalping, how it works, who/why they do it. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYMIPmgRb_M&list=WL&index=94


TL;DW - they do this to get the price where they want it because they know people are watching the order book (the video is quite enlightening), and the key point that keeps this from being an illegal activity (on regulated exchanges) is THAT THEY DO MAKE TRADES FOR THOSE SIZES eventually. This doesn’t always work and they get stuck in these positions. Risk/reward.


The ironic part about this spoofing idea is Finex is one of the few, if not only exchanges, that offer hidden orders. So people trying to scalp always have to worry if there is a monster hidden order lurking.  


Go to the UPDATE: AUGUST 7TH of this story and watch the video he claims proves spoofing and Phil Potter admitting it in the voice over. https://hackernoon.com/meet-spoofy-how-a-single-entity-dominates-the-price-of-bitcoin-39c711d28eb4 


I see nothing wrong with what Phil says and no proof of anything in the video. Again this is true on every exchange trading anything of volume in the world. People with large amounts of money move markets, oh the horror. I “technically” do this when I place an order and pull it for whatever reason (scared, mistake, etc.) just not in large sums, but I would if I had large sums. 


“And who the hell is going to go margin long so dramatically after a huge crash?” The crash they are referring to is from the early June ATH to the mid-July correction. A 45-day crash? Well, I am one of those people that went margin long. And many many others who read charts, resistance, support, retracement info. Again, this smacks of someone who doesn’t know what they are talking about.





REASON FOR PRICE RISE/BTC GOES UP WHEN TETHERS ARE CREATED


This is absurd. This completely negates everything else, the Japanese currency ruling and them entering the market, Koreans coming into the market in a huge way (they now have the largest exchange by far with close to a Billion traded DAILY, oh and they don’t use Tether at all), the successful hard fork, or the more (positive!) interest from the media and people than ever before in BTC history.  


Instead, we are supposed to think that $395 million dollars of tethers are the reason for this rise in a $160+ Billion market cap.
￼

C’mon people! Look at that volume for the last 30 days. 
https://imgur.com/a/vKJ5g
Also, the overwhelming majority of trade does not exist in Tether but KRW, CNY, USD, JPY. 


Tethers are usually created when extra liquidity is needed, be it a crash or a spike. Because more people are trading. 


They try to prove Tether boosts the market with this picture in their article.
https://imgur.com/a/274SE


The problem is 2 of the last 3 tether dumps coincide with a downturn. In fact, there is nothing in this graph that proves this theory. Also, the last tether dump/price rise coincides perfectly with the news of the majority of miners signaling segwit2x for the first time (search r/bitcoin or r/btc around that date). 


So do you think the market traded billions of $ at that time because of a $50 million Tether dump or because for the first time in YEARS a solution and path forward became visible??






THEY DON’T HAVE BANKING//NO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS/FAKE TETHERS-TERMS OF SERVICE


In regards to banking, clearly they have some kind of banking and a way for large amounts of fiat to get in and out. The banking is not for you and me but for regional bitcoin exchanges and other large customers. 


You know how I know this? If they didn’t the internet would be flooded with Finex withdrawal issues, there would be a price premium on Bitfinex compared to other exchanges, just like Mt. Gox had for so long and also Bitfinex earlier in the year when the banking issues started. 


This article explains it very clearly (seriously read this article), it has nothing to do with this controversy, just the banking issue in April.

https://medium.com/@Austerity_Sucks/why-bitfinex-went-from-a-premium-in-its-crypto-usd-pairs-to-now-a-significant-discount-e7be193d7cb0 


TL;DR - All of the imbalances discussed (Finex premium) have been a result of USD frictions into Bitfinex. It has been a chain reaction resulting from the initial freeze to the various gradual withdrawal options. As soon as Bitfinex conclusively addresses the USD flow issues, the crypto pair prices will normalize (which they did) with other exchanges that don’t have banking frictions and USDT price will return to par (which it did).


The premiums on Finex and Tether are what would prove something is wrong, yet they are not here. Surprisingly Finex has been at a discount to GDAX and GEMINI recently. Meaning people are willing to take a loss on prices to be able to lend on Finex. This too will normalize as people/bots arb. 


Aug 9th… From “arguably” bank fraud
https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed/status/895339675120013313


Aug 22nd…. To “admitting” bank fraud
https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed/status/900230917196836864


Listen to that audio in the second link, listen carefully. His explanation is perfectly reasonable. Banks don’t work well, consistently, or at all with crypto related companies (marijuana companies too for that matter) especially in jurisdictions that are outside US/Europe. Surprise surprise, this is nothing new.  When they find out customers, deposits/wire are cryptos related they pull the plug (a reason why Trex/Polo don’t mess with USD). 


Also, they gave their customers a haircut, probably a lot of complaints about the hack to Wells Fargo and other banks. These are the correspondent's banks, not Finex’s, they have banking. This is how they can receive large institutional deposits and withdrawals. Which I bet make up the majority of the fiat deposits and withdrawals. 


Classic 80/20 business rule, 20% of your clients are providing 80% of the liquidity plus you are having banking issues (which is expected in crypto-land), so you cut this service to the 80% saving time/resources/headaches for the 20% loss in a single service to them (no fiat withdrawal/deposits- but crypto flows in and out with ease).


Again if they weren’t able to get money in and out there would be a premium, there would be a long line of complaints online. I have no reason (or proof) to believe that money is NOT coming into/out of the exchange.


It makes total sense too, they are the best lending platform, have one of the most liquid exchanges, and have by far the most reliable and best software/servers/UI/order options. You cannot deny this fact, they are constantly a top 3 exchange in volume, even after a hack.


I use Finex (as well as others) because of all those things. Also, they have already been hacked, a second hack seems less likely (IMO, they have more to lose with another hack). They have many big events on the horizon (Ethfinex). Would a company be putting resources into these things if this is all fraud or an exit scam? I find that unlikely. Is this 100% full proof? Of course not, nothing is, especially in crypto, just my reasons for trading there.



Institutional Investors -  https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/are-legitimate-institutional-investors-really-coming-onto-bitfinex-s-platform-i-don-t-think-so-cb4ed5175092
Here is what this person doesn’t comprehend, what if these institutional investors are… you ready… here it comes… other exchanges that use Tether, as well as other crypto related businesses. It is only $395 million Tethers. These exchanges (Trex, Finex, Polo) are printing money. 


This isn’t “someone” with 100’s of millions of dollars as the article suggests, it’s many people with millions/thousands of dollars. Again this all ignores the fact that many more people have entered the ecosystem this year. This is proven by Coinbase growth, transaction growth, and exchange growth (both in volume and # of exchanges), and growth in crypto-related sub-Reddits. 


Yet Bitfinexed is shocked that lending hits ATH’s, but it is perfectly explainable and reasonable based on the evidence and data of gthe ecosystem. Let us not forget BTC is a finite amount, more people are going to increase demand/price, if you think this is a bubble... you haven’t seen anything yet. 


The TOS are sketchy and a point of concern but there are two things to keep in mind- It was necessary to word it that way, and the market clearly doesn’t care. 


If they had worded it that they will redeem no matter what, they would have money launderers flocking to the service (bogging down resources), plus law enforcement knocking. 


Tethers weren’t created to get $ in/out of crypto but to provide a safe haven and liquidity on exchanges that don’t use USD. And I would say they are working perfectly. Very few are withdrawing USDT for USD. 


I think it is precisely because of what the co-founder of tether refers to here (and below)… “If you want to convert USD₮ into fiat currency (or vice-versa) at tether.to, you must go through the whole “aggressive” KYC/AML process and get verified. I’ve heard from many who tried and were unable to provide sufficient documentation. Tether’s KYC/AML policies were written by experienced compliance officers and it’s critical that it be done properly and with diligence. It really is about “knowing your customer” and making sure that their uses are legitimate.”  This is a perfectly reasonable explanation why people are not lining up to cash out of Tether, and also why large/reputable institutions can (exchanges, investors, etc.).


 



TETHERS REPLY TO ALL THIS, PLUS UPCOMING AUDIT
https://tether.to/tether-update/


Now ask yourself this, would a company that is operating fraudulently have a roadmap of all these new features that no one will ever use if they don’t provide these promised audits as they say they will by the end of the year?


So as of now they have enough runway until the end of the year. I say we give Tether/Finex the benefit of the doubt.


While Tether could be operating fractionally (so to could any exchange in crypto btw), there is no proof or evidence of it today. It trades at normalized rates. You can’t just create 100’s of million of dollars without the marketing realizing somewhere.


Sure, you can say this is a confidence game, but so is crypto, so is the USD, so is the concept of money. I see no reason to be more concerned with this risk than the already risky environment we trade in with exchanges.







WHAT IF I”M WRONG? CRYPTO WILL IMPLODE!


No it won’t. Sure there will be a dip maybe even a correction, but there are only 395 million Tethers. People will get out of Tether even at massive discounts (until $0) into crypto because they can’t get USD, but not more than the 395 million tethers circulating (at this time). 


At a certain discount people will understand what is going on and stop trading for Tether. BTC + ETH is worth over $100 billion, how many time does the entire amount of USDT have to turn over to cause a massive crash?  


What will get hit the hardest are the people left holding tether (if/when they implode) and Trex/Polo/Finex. 


To think Polo/Trex would rely so much on USDT that they didn’t fully vet it is absurd as well. Whats more likely, Polo/Trex’s due diligence or this @Bitfinexed person based on conjecture?


I’ve already seen a Forbes contributor try and get ahold of Bitfinexed on twitter. https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/894437272241569792  


Could I be wrong about all of this??? Of course, but, I feel I have provided more evidence than the other side. You are the Judge :)






USEFUL INFO


Some from u/udecker - Tether co-founder


Tether.to is who has the backing for the token, not Bitfinex. Bitfinex is a customer of Tether. If Bitfinex wants more Tether, they make a request to Tether, just like all other Tether customers. Tether waits for USD to show up, and when it does, creates the necessary tethers and credits Bitfinex. They both have Tawainese banking so money can flow back and forth easily. (The banking industry in the country of Taiwan are under scrutiny lately because of larger legal issues not involving crypto, but clearly affecting crypto companies)


https://wallet.tether.to/transparency


Tether wasn’t designed to be a profit machine. It was designed to be a utility for the crypto community to provide a stable token (with all the benefits of this).
Tether’s business model is this:
1. Generate fees from wire deposits and withdrawals and conversions.
2. Interest income on the reserve.


Bitfinex’s parent company owns a 20% stake in Tether.


People say Tether isn’t being burned. But they are being recycled which is/was always an option.





I hope we can have a productive conversation around this without the usual Gox 2.0, sell it all, Bitfinex is the anti-christ comments with no substance.
Give us your opinion and perspective because maybe I am missing something… but, maybe you are too.

Antonopoulos' Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/aantonop/posts) (it's a public entry posted on 16th of December. The readability and formatting is better there btw):*

*Edit: direct link to the post: https://www.patreon.com/posts/emotional-15912702*  

----------------  




On December 6th, my life changed trajectory... again. I went to sleep on a wave of positive messages and support from the bitcoin community, in response to a letter I had posted on Patreon titled “In defense of optimism” that had leaked to Reddit.
I had spent the day reading messages of support pouring in on Twitter, Patreon, and email, literally thousands of them. It was a life-affirming experience. Like everyone else on social media, the messages I receive are not always kind and supportive. Often the critical messages and trolls are far louder than the supporters. Our brains don't evaluate praise and criticism in equal measure - it's easy to believe the criticism and see the praise as undeserved. That’s why each little message of support makes a difference, each one helps me ignore the critics and see the impact of my work. In addition to all of the written messages, people were signing up to support me on Patreon and some were even sending bitcoin to my donation address. By the time I went to sleep, I was filled with gratitude, humbled by the overwhelmingly positive, viral response of the community. 

Here’s what happened next...

I wake up on December 7th, the notifications list on my phone was too long to scroll. Hundreds more messages of support had come in while I was asleep.

Then my phone rings and I recognize the number of a dear friend. ""Strange,"" I think. I’m not expecting a call. ""Don't open your laptop yet,"" she says. ""You got some big bitcoin donations overnight. Are you sitting down?"" I sit down. I open my laptop, I look at the balance in my 1andreas bitcoin donation address.

Surprise, gratitude, fear, shock, joy, elation, anxiety. My emotions achieved a level of volatility that mirrored that of the bitcoin exchange rate. Good thing I was sitting down.

You're probably thinking that between the supportive messages and the large donations, I’d have been celebrating without a care in the world. But I'm a security professional who works in bitcoin. Could I come up with a doomsday scenario to taint this experience? Hold my beer.

I'm in a taxi on the way to the airport. I’m cycling through emotions again, a bit faster now.

Joy, Terror, Tears, Gratitude, Fear, Elation, Dread, Cold Sweat. It's a good thing I'm sitting down. I can't feel my fingers.

Anxiety

Wouldn't it be ironic if I get hacked and this massive donation is stolen the same day it was given? *Shudder*. That was a real possibility. Funds were sent to a vanity address, posted on my website, which was mainly used to support my habit of giving small amounts of bitcoin to strangers at meetups and conferences. Before December 6th, the address typically received small gifts each month and I emptied it every now and then in a spree of small donations. 

Gratitude

I still can’t believe how many people have responded. I had no idea how many people could identify with the feelings expressed “In defense of optimism” and would want to show their support. I’m grateful to be a part of this community.

Fear 

This vanity address is secured with a single private key which was stored on my phone in a “hot” wallet, so that I can give away bitcoin at meetups. The address has maximum public visibility and no Segwit (segregated witness) support. My security model just tipped over and I'm freaking out.

Happiness

I’m so happy! This is incredible, unimaginable. My fingers are numb, in a good way. Is this really happening?!?

Cold Sweats

I have to move the funds out. Now. Right now. But I only have this key on a wallet that doesn't handle RBF (replace-by-fee), CPFP (child-pays-for-parent), and it's not a Segwit address. I'm traveling; I’m about to get on two long flights and the mempool is slammed with transactions. Of all the days!

Joy

I’m crying. Tears of joy. This is something most people never get to experience in the most meaningful of careers, a loud acknowledgement from an entire community and financial security. I’m thinking about my family members and close friends who are struggling and overjoyed at the opportunity I now have to help them. 

Terror

Then it dawns on me: a perfect nightmare scenario. What if this is considered ""income"" in the US and I have to pay taxes at a 39.6% rate? Those taxes would be evaluated on the USD value of the donation at the time it was made, at an all-time-high price of bitcoin. If bitcoin's bubble bursts by 50% today, I will owe more taxes than the donation is worth. I will be bankrupt but will owe the IRS and those debts can't be discharged in bankruptcy. I'm going to be in debt for a decade!

Elation

I can HODL! I don’t have to keep selling to pay bills. Patreon has grown too, so I should be able to cover my expenses and build the business with their support. I can really HODL!

[Alarm buzzes on my phone]

“Boarding on Gate D15”. Pack everything back up, run to the gate. Find my seat. Unpack all my electronics. Re-establish connections. No Wifi yet. 3G if I hold my phone just so against the window. We're taking off. No Wifi at all on this flight. 4 hours, offline, me and my thoughts. What is the opposite of a state of mindfulness? Head spinning.

Fear

What if the price crashes. Should I sell some?

Silliness

I'm buying a lambo (I laugh out loud at the thought of that. No, I'd never waste money on something so silly).

Dread

What if the donations had zero fees and will never confirm? What if this was all a cruel joke? 

Joy

My dad will be so proud!

[Landed]

Turn on smartphone. Too many notifications. Turn on VPN, Tor. Sync wallet. Too slow. Too slow.

Run to the lounge. Get on Wifi. Fire up VPN, Tor. Start electrum. Import keys. Child-pays-for-parent the stuck transactions, Replace-by-fee new transactions. Careful coin selection. Send to cold storage (so glad I keep an unused cold storage address handy). Overpay fees more than ever before. 2000 satoshi per byte? Fuck yeah. This is the highest priority transaction of my life. 8 agonizing minutes. 1st block. Confirmations ripple down my screen. Exhaling... I hadn't noticed I was holding my breath.

“Boarding gate C51”. Pack everything, run to the gate. Board the plane. Unpack everything. This flight has Wifi. Bet it doesn't work. Yup, it doesn't work. 6.5 hour flight. I'll just read a book. I've read the same paragraph 8 times and don't know what it says. I'll sleep. Nope. Ok fine, I'll fret - seems I'm good at that and nothing else right now.

[Landed]

That was the longest flight ever. Boot up, 4G, VPN, Tor. Sync.... slow, too slow.

ANOTHER GIANT DONATION. WTF! Is this really happening? Is my wallet counting the balance incorrectly? This isn't possible. WTF IS GOING ON?

Joy, Terror, Tears, Gratitude, Fear, Elation, Dread. I’m cycling faster now.

I just emptied my wallet into cold storage and now it's carrying a ridiculous amount again. Boot up, VPN, Tor, Electrum, CPFP, RBF, cold sweat, 1 confirmation. Phew.

I realize that I just conducted the 4 biggest transactions of my life. I'm shaking. Hope I didn't screw anything up.

Finally I get to my hotel. “Long day” doesn’t even begin to describe it. I am grateful, giddy, jetlagged and exhausted, so sleep should come easy, right? Not happening. Two hours of tossing and turning while my mind is racing. In the end I just pass out from exhaustion. I wake up in a state of anxiety. 

I open my inbox. I have a dozen interview requests from newspapers, TV, radio. They don’t want to talk about bitcoin. They want to talk about “my story.” It’s never been about “my story” and I’m not about to change that. Denied, denied, denied. That’s it. I’m going offline for a few days. I need time to process everything that has happened over the past couple of days and strategize about what to do next.

There are no words to adequately convey my appreciation, my gratitude. 

These are life-changing gifts, but I don’t intend to change my life. I’m highly suspicious and careful about “lifestyle inflation”: I resist any urges to increase my spending as my income increases because as a self-employed entrepreneur I know my income can decrease significantly at any moment. 

First, the practical side: For legal and tax reasons the gifts should remain mostly untouched for at least three years. This is a new situation and no one knows for sure how the authorities will characterize it. I wanted to HODL anyway, so that’s fine with me.

Second, and the much more important side, I love what I do. I’m obviously not going to “retire” or slow down. Receiving your messages and support has energized me and I’m excited to do more, much more. 

The number of people supporting me on Patreon has grown significantly and with that support I’ll actually be able to do a lot more. And there are many things I want to do:  a new website with more materials, in as many formats and languages as possible; more books; an epic tour; and that’s just the beginning!  I also plan to grow my team, which serves two goals: I can get help for the things that need to be done, but I can also bring more people success and security with a steady paycheck.

While I’m excited about all of these new projects, I want you to know that the ultimate goal remains the same: to educate as many people as possible about this transformational technology and remain an independent voice, working directly for the community. 

A week has passed. The one feeling that keeps returning, among the barrage of feelings, is gratitude. After taking time to process and calm down, the fear and stress is gone and all that is left is gratitude. I am so thankful for all the messages of support. I am so touched to hear stories of how my work has affected others in a positive way. I am thankful for all the donors who rallied behind me to help me in my advocacy and education.

USDT,Bitcoin,About this Tether/Bitfinex FUD,"For the past months (can’t remember when I first read about it) we have seen a lot of FUD about Bitfinex and Tether (effectively the same company if I am correct). Supposedly (according to the rumors) they are printing money out of thin air to pump the Bitcoin price.


So far the people that are spreading these rumors haven’t provided any evidence for this, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t true of-course. Because if it is, it would be impossible to prove. On the other side it’s also impossible for Bitfinex to prove they aren’t doing this.


So I thought it would be best to look at it from a rational point of view and determine if Bitfinex has any interest of doing this.

**Printing Tether**


Let’s first look at how likely it is that more Tether is printed than they actually hold in dollars.


Pros:


* Printing money out of thin air could have helped them to repay the funds of the hack.

* It will make them more wealthy (humans are very greedy)


Cons:


* They didn’t need to pay back the people from the hack, they gave them shitty tokens and they never said when those people would get their money back.

* They earn about **half a billion dollars** every year on trading fees (0.1% on every trade) and margin lending fees (15% on every loan), so why would they risk printing a few hundred million Tether?

* If anything goes wrong in this plan (and a lot can go wrong when you print money out of thin air) they lose everything. Their money making machine Bitfinex will be gone and they risk jail time (none of the people behind Bitfinex are anonymous).

Sure the half a billion dollars they earn from fees isn’t all profit. They probably have some costs too to run the exchange. But it surely doesn’t cost them half a billion dollars to run a website. It probably doesn’t even cost them a million dollars.

**Using Tether (or the money they earn from trading fees) to pump the Bitcoin price (or another coin)**


Even if they aren’t printing Tether out of thin air they could still be using their own money to pump the market.

Pros:


* When the price is increasing we get a lot of trading activity and the rising price also attracts new users, which causes Bitfinex to earn more on trading fees.

* By manipulating the market they can earn a lot on margin trading and make even more money than the half a billion dollars they earn on fees.

Cons:


* The Bitcoin market has become rather huge, in fact trading volume is on par with some of the biggest stocks. On some days we get close to 4 billion dollars in trading volume in a single day! When you try to manipulate such a liquid market with a few million dollars you risk that a bigger whale (of which we have plenty) will eat your lunch.

* Often completely random shit (like China banning Bitcoin) can cause the price to suddenly crash significantly. If Bitfinex is trying to pump the price when something like that happens they lose a lot.

We also have to ask ourselves if they are really “pumping” the Bitcoin price when they are not doing this with Tether but with the money they earn from fees. In my opinion when someone uses his own money to buy Bitcoin they are simply buying Bitcoin or trading,whatever you want to call it.


**Conclusion**


I am not saying the rumors aren’t true, but there is simply no way of proving they are or aren’t true. It just seems very unlikely to me. Bitfinex earns an insane amount of money on fees it seems very unlikely they would take so much risk to earn a little bit extra. And “pumping” the price of a coin with the money they earn on fees is something every exchange or wealthy person could be doing. Last week Roger Ver was publicly trying to do the exact opposite, with 25000 coins. When people are buying or selling Bitcoins can we really call that “pumping” and “dumping” or is that just the free market at play?",10,2017-11-19 11:07:51,45

USDT,Bitcoin,BTC has been pumped with newly printed tethers. I reckon when the scam is unveiled it's gonna be a disaster for the whole market.

USDT,Bitcoin,Do Tether control the peg of USDT by printing more when demand is high? Or is the peg set by market faith? Please help me settle this once and for all!,"Many people seem to think that Tether control the price of USDT by printing more if demand on the exchanges goes up, and burning it when demand goes down.        

     
This is quite clearly wrong in my opinion. The price of Tether is effectively pegged by the way they sell it for $1, and promise to buy it back for $1. The market has faith in this promise and therefore values it at around $1. It is not a true peg, but it is effectively pegged due to market faith.         
    
I have argued this point with people many times but it just goes round in circles, they usually give up as they cannot provide any proof, logic or reasoning as to why they are right, but their opinion remains unchanged and so they continue spreading it around the forums.          

I am hoping that this thread can settle this in peoples minds once and for all, as it is important to realise that the USDT peg is purely a psychological one that rests on Tethers promise of buying it back. Without that, USDT is free-floating.           
**So, is USDT pegged by a) controlling the supply, or b) because of the price Tether sell and promise to buy it back for?**

**How I send mistakenly 1 BTC to the Huobi Cold Wallet?**

A day I was watching a BTC rich list and exploring the addresses. I'm unsure how exactly it happens because I verified the address, but when I sent 1 BTC I did mistakenly to the wrong address!!! I verified that I was sending to the correct address, but I had to remake the sendship because the wallet crashed, probably there was the problem, the huobi's cold wallet address was in the clipboard. Anyways I don't have certainty how it happens.List:  [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)

It was a mistake, I work often sending and receiving BTC. When you do a certain task all the days copying wrong data could be a **TERRIBLE** but **EASY** mistake to do, because we are humans and we fall in the trust. **As you did a task correctly many many times you earn trust on yourself and try save time.** If it didn't happens to you ever you aren't being honest.

**7 months talking with Huobi Customer Support (part 1)**

I tried to contact Huobi's customer support. First they first didn't understand me, thinking that I tried to deposit on Huobi and sent to a wrong address. After they understand they told me that the address doesn't belongs to Huobi and they can't help me. That is false, I did an investigation and they have direct relation with this address, they can help me. Read my following analysis please:

&#x200B;

**Huobi Ownership Analysis**

Searching, sites says that the address belongs to Huobi Huobi support says that address doesn't belongs to Huobi

I don't know if belongs to Huobi or not, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi

Why? The address 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 regulary sent big amounts to 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D

Then, is VERY PROBABLY THAT 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 OWNER KNOWS 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D OWNER And the 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D OWNER can help me.

Again, I don't know really if the address is of Huobi, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi

Why? On my Huobi account I made only 2 BTC withdraws from Huobi in the past

In both transaction, all inputs are addresses that BELONGS TO HUOBI, because you huobi are sending me BTC

Both transactions has 39 addresses as inputs in common (all huobi address, maybe deposit addresses of anothers huobi users)

USDT,Bitcoin,The Lightning Network quietly surpasses over 1000 open channels on mainnet.,"https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/?100=

Lightning is quite possibly the biggest innovation in crypto in years.  Lightning can do what no other altcoin can ever dream of; unlimited transactions per second, truly instant confirmations, and all backed by high level of security.

Lightning is going to be future of online payments.  The developers deserve a lot of credit, as do the brave souls risking their Bitcoin to trailblaze this new network.  Great work everybody.

On a side note.  It's funny how throughout November and December, despite all the FUD about Lightning being ""vaporware"", segwit adoption stalling, blockchain congestion, and sky high fees, we saw unprecedented price growth, up to $20k.

Meanwhile, now that the congestion is gone, fees are down to pennies, segwit adoption has increased, and Lightning is here and growing fast, we see falling prices.

This market is extremely irrational.  Hodl on tight.  It's a good sign when devs are quietly making amazing progress amidst price drops.  It's just setting us up for the next big bull run.",1047,2018-02-01 14:30:11,312

1. They printed USDT out of air 
2. They bought BTC w it and pumped the price up. 
3. They sold some BTC back to cover their underlying USDT liability. 

So bad. They cheated. Everybody says. 

BUT - read the step 3 above. They sold BTC to get those dollars. Read it again - they sold those BTC.

So how can this impact BTC *again* ? It can't. They already sold BTC and created a downward pressure. 

How is this different to taking a loan from bank and buy BTC with it? Many people took a loan from bank and bit later they sold some BTC and repaid that loan. How is that different? 

Right - it is no different. And thus there is no need to panic about BTC exploding. 

Yes there is a moral hazard issue with Teth and it is good that they got a subpoena. Good job SEC. 

But this is no concern for viability of BTC. No concern. Maybe some negative sentiment because somebody cheated again. Yeah. Thats all. 

(EDIT - I forgot to add that if the conspiracy of unbacked Tether is true it means that Teth cheated everybody who was buying above 8k. Those buying above 8k basically gave these alleged Teth scammers real liquidity to sell their ""BTC financed by air"" for real dollars. So ultimately what happened you bought unbacked tether in exchange of your fiat if you are down on BTC and you should sue Teth if the wrongdoing is proven. 

BUT my point stays the same - it is likely already over. When they have those real dollars on balance sheet the downward pressure stops.).",4,2018-02-04 15:42:52,27

USDT,Bitcoin,"China isn't at ""war"" with crypto. They're trying to make it work for them.","Anti-Chinese memes are fun and all, but I wanted to give you guys a clearer picture about what's happening in China right now.

China has a history of trying to legislate around free-market economies in a way that doesn't impede the market but still works for them. When Hong Kong was ceded back to China in ~~1999~~ 1997, [China made Hong Kong a separate economic zone](https://www.ft.com/content/eb0e795a-3d17-11e6-9f2c-36b487ebd80a), thus allaying fears that China would kill one of the world's most important market economies.

This is exactly what's happening in China right now. the PRC is trying to make Bitcoin work within the Chinese economy. They are NOT trying to kill a thriving economic market.

Exhibit A: [China isn't shutting down exchanges, they're forcing them to get licensed.](https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-bitcoin-exchanges-may-face-stricter-regulation-and-licensure) That means all exchanges will have to conform to stricter guidelines about accounting and tracking, which might not please the crypto-anarchists but does mean a lesser likelihood of a Chinese Mt Gox event. What we're seeing right now is a transition from non-regulated to regulated.

Exhibit B: [Rumor has it the PBoC wants to introduce a ""digital yuan"" that will serve as a CNY tether.](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-07-03/pboc-hires-blockchain-engineers-who-will-oversee-creation-digital-rmb) This means the PBoC can control the entry and exit of CNY on the Chinese exchanges. This is critical to making crypto work for China, since taking CNY out of China is illegal.

In other words, once the dust settles on China, the Chinese Government will know how its own currency flows through the market, and it will know it's doing this through regulated exchanges that Chinese criminals cannot use to launder money.

This is a far cry from China simply trying to outlaw Bitcoin. This is China, realizing the potential of cryptocurrency, deciding to see if they can make it work on their own market. 

**tl;dr: Ignore the China FUD. China is actively trying to make crypto work for them, not destroy it.**

USDT,Bitcoin,Why it's Bitcoin or nothing,"I listened to a podcast recently where Elon Musk was being a bit critical of Bitcoin. That's fine, we should be critical, but I think there is something important to understand that is not well understood by technologists.


Bitcoin is competing as a store of value and as a payment network. Payment networks are a solved problem. You could put a payment network on top of Bitcoin in the same way you could put a payment network on top of Visa. Layering is also a solved problem.


Store of value is not a solved problem. This only relates to the technology insofar as people trust the technology or they don't. Storing value is fundamentally a trust problem. Trust that others will agree. Trust that the protocol won't fail. It has nothing to do with transaction speeds or energy use or anything like that. Gold is a tremendous energy consumer and does zero transactions per second.


Bitcoin could run on baby seal oil and settle one transaction a day and the world might still price everything in Satoshis one day. That's the game here.


Right now global trade is denominated in dollars. This has not bogged down the postal system. No dollars are harmed when the world prices everything in dollars.


What _can't_ happen is that something else comes and usurps Bitcoin as a store of value. As a payment network? Sure. As a store of value? Impossible. Why? Because stores of value are about trust, and if something usurps Bitcoin then the naysayers that say that ""Bitcoin"" and ""crypto"" are interchangeable will be right. Nobody will trust ""crypto"" as a store of value ever again because whatever token seems to be winning will just be replaced by something ""better."" Bitcoin has something that can't be replicated by technology. It was the first.


It's the same as thinking some alloy that you created might replace gold as a store of value because everyone is going to believe your marketing about why its ""better"" when in reality what would happen if that idea started to take off is that nobody would trust metals as a store of value anymore... and you'd get a dozen competitors explaining why its actually better to mix gold with copper or zinc with cadmium and why their special metal blend (that they have a bunch of and will happily sell you) is the best blend.


And hey, wouldn't you know it, that's exactly what the long tail of ""store of value"" shitcoins looks like.


---------------

Edit: Some further clarification


Think of the dollar. The dollar isn't a payment network, but everything is denominated in dollars.

You can transact dollars with PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, Tether, checks, Venmo, money orders, physical dollar bills, etc. In total, there are probably a thousand ways to transact in dollars all over the world. Dollars do zero transactions per second.

**What I am saying:**

The store of value aspect of Bitcoin cannot be replicated by technology, because it isn't a technology problem. We may have a future where value is denominated in Satoshis. We may not. We will not have a future where value is denominated in some XYZ coin.

**What I am not saying:**

Bitcoin is the best payment network. Everyone will use Bitcoin as a payment network because its the best technology for payment networks.",98,2024-01-24 16:26:44,164

Germany selling its stash was supposed to crash the market. gox selling its stash was supposed to crash the market.

these were huge fears years ago. the gox and German sale barely affected the market.


it's truly remarkable how far we have come.

what is the current FUD in the market?

I have to ask because there is so little I'm not even aware of it as a casual observer.

seem to me like all the FUD boogeyman are dead.

Tethers are traded on a few exchanges, so IF tethers are fraudulent, then $640,000,000 in value could disappear quickly, having an impact on the traders and/or exchanges.  

At the end of it all, it comes down to trust in Tethers, that are locked 1:1 to USD, and are treated as such by Bitfinex exchange.

# Here’s the ideal progression of a Bitcoiner:

* *Bitcoin only*
* *Hard Wallet*
* *Buys the dips*
* *Runs a node*
* *Carries orange pills*

The last item is critical, and you’ll understand why by the time I get done educating you.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m36sx2pw6x481.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2eee8e3a49d9d0c430a5f1cf1c937ac36fa2b9b1

&#x200B;

Bitcoin’s distribution is fixed and predictable; there’s a block mined once every ten minutes and inflation is adjusted once every four years in an event known as *halving*.

The block reward currently is 6.25 BTC. Since blocks are mined once every ten minutes, that’s 6 blocks an hour, and 144 blocks every day. That means 900 BTC are mined each day. The current price of BTC is $50,000. So why is this relevant? Because of this:

$45,000,000 worth of new BTC is hitting the open market every day.

Think back to May of last year just before the most recent halving. There were 1800 blocks being produced a day at an average BTC price of $7500, meaning $13,500,000 of new BTC was being produced daily. And if that would’ve remained the same after the halving, it would’ve been $6,750,000. That’s why anyone that understood this stuff knew immediately that was the last chance to ever buy BTC under 5 figures. Michael Sailor was all over it, and a maxi I knew literally sold his house under market value, moved into an Airstream trailer, and sold me his motorcycle on the cheap. He made the wise decisions, me not so much, although I’ve been dollar cost averaging in for many years.

So armed with this knowledge, you should understand immediately why halvings are so important, and why BTC fights an existentially tougher battle to maintain its price each time it moons to all time highs. You should also see why it’s so volatile at times, and why with enough time, that will go away too. There is no better investment than BTC longterm, and I’m convinced people should dump 50% of their IRA’s and 401k’s in favor of a Trezor, Ledger, or Coldcard hard wallet. This is an asset you build generational wealth with, and pass on to your children. Now about those orange pills…

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jse89sv96x481.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=943974ed3dbbde05ed568967d3f7353b74457348

Adoption is the only thing that matters. The Matrix-related orange pill meme was developed literally because maxi’s realized many years ago that absorbing bitcoin’s inflation would lead to exponential price growth. Supply and demand. That’s it. That’s why it’s played out so favorably and consistently. That’s what’s governed it for 13 years. And in those years, when was the best time to sell bitcoin?

# Never

And if you did sell, you missed out huge. This is an asset that rewards HODLers and relentlessly punishes traders. I authored a post recently explaining why even if you guess the longterm direction correctly trading bitcoin, you’ll lose money, and if you’re leveraged, you’ll almost certainly go broke. I highlighted this with a gold/Papiermark chart from the Weimar Republic. Most traders who correctly bet against this famously hyperinflating currency went broke, especially the leveraged ones. Look at the chart. The volatility was too extreme and the directional velocity was too slow.

&#x200B;

# THERE IS NO MANIPULATION

Most of bitcoin social media is contaminated with this conspiratorial nonsense of manipulation right now. Several fine bitcoiners newer to the space have reached out, PM’ing me with these talking points. It’s starting to feel like a meme-stock sub or QAnon get together in Wyoming where “shorts haven’t covered yet”, and Trump is only weeks away from being restored to the White House. What you’re seeing are bitcoin’s very own dynamics playing out, not the workings of George Soros

Bitcoin isn’t gold which has physical borders it can’t traverse. It’s not gold which can’t be used for settlement. It’s not gold that coming out of Bretton Woods, saw 70% of reserves held in custodial vaults in the US. It’s not OPEC which controls 80% of the world’s Brent crude production. It’s not a stock of which more than half is owned by board members and executives who on a whim can issue bonds, issue more shares, issue commercial paper, draw on massive credit facilities, and restructure share classes.

In order to control and manipulate something global worth trillions of dollars in a meaningful way longterm, you have to have ownership of a very large portion of that underlying asset, preferably more than 50%, because if it exists in a truly free market, your attempts at control would be equivalent to selling naked calls or naked puts. One fast move in either direction and you’re bankrupt. There’s too much game theory to try for delta-neutral positions either, which would require enormous amounts of money and faster devaluation (printing) of the currency you were using to achieve this. And this all assumes it never moved up in value. The more it does that, the more out of reach this becomes, eventually being the thing that’s margin calling you.

Bitcoin is open source. It’s decentralized. It’s free market. It trades globally 24/7. It’s permissionless. Its distribution is fixed and predictable. It’s pseudonymous. Verifiable. It’s impairment resistant. It’s a store of value, a currency, and a central bank, in one singularity. It’s full-stack is sophisticated, impossibly simple, beautiful, and looks like something you’d expect of 20-years worth of work from the cypherpunks that gave us encryption.

2% of the global population owns bitcoin. On most technology adoption curves, 13% is still considered “early adopter”. So we have plenty of time, and a bunch of orange pills to slip into drinks, place on tongues, and press into palms.

Gary Gensler (SEC Chair) is going to drop the hammer on pre-mine altcoins and stablecoins early next year. This video cracks me up:

[https://twitter.com/HODLneverSODL/status/1468495579663769600?s=20](https://twitter.com/HODLneverSODL/status/1468495579663769600?s=20)

This will benefit bitcoin in enormous ways. Gensler is friendly to bitcoin regardless of what you might've heard, and taught BTC and blockchain courses at MIT when he was a professor there. Not everything is rosy though. A massive Mt. Got distribution is coming next year which will not be beneficial to BTC, at least in the short-term. Otherwise the only other going concern might be an invasion of Ukraine by Russia in the dead of winter that could spike energy prices 50% and cause the bitcoin mining *economy of scale* enough trouble the leveraged ones distribute their coins too. Be prepared to buy the dip. There’s only 21M of these things, which isn’t even enough for everyone in the state of Florida, let alone the US, let alone the whole world.

Stack your bitcoin. Act broke. Have more than you show. And say less than you know.

A day I was watching a BTC rich list and exploring the addresses. I'm unsure how exactly it happens because I verified the address, but when I sent 1 BTC I did mistakenly to the wrong address!!! I verified that I was sending to the correct address, but I had to remake the sendship because the wallet crashed, probably there was the problem, the huobi's cold wallet address was in the clipboard. Anyways I don't have certainty how it happens.List:  [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)

It was a mistake, I work often sending and receiving BTC.

I tried to contact Huobi's customer support. First they first didn't understand me, thinking that I tried to deposit on Huobi and sent to a wrong address. After they understand they told me that the address doesn't belongs to Huobi and they can't help me. That is false, I did an investigation and they have direct relation with this address, they can help me. Read my following analysis please:

**Huobi Ownership Analysis**

Searching, sites says that the address belongs to Huobi Huobi support says that address doesn't belongs to Huobi

I don't know if belongs to Huobi or not, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi

Why? The address 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 regulary sent big amounts to 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D

Again, I don't know really if the address is of Huobi, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi

Why? On my Huobi account I made only 2 BTC withdraws from Huobi in the past

2018-05-08 18:36:45 , txid: 0e6bf02323ebc166b6638afcd6170ecb73948748235e687def7e7a3cb1902fca , it has 239 inputs 2018-05-08 20:17:10 , txid: b59b988d642fe3773268e246ef1a0d048bbd3f734a611d00722b39126ed9e20b , it has 239 inputs too

In both transaction, all inputs are addresses that BELONGS TO HUOBI, because you huobi are sending me BTC

Both transactions has 39 addresses as inputs in common (all huobi address, maybe deposit addresses of anothers huobi users)

Coinbase I don't trust and heard about ftx so don't want to lose my shit. You brilliant people. If you could humble me with a solution that'd be fantastic.

Please read the complete story here:

IThe reason why I'm giving more details here is that [u/symbiotic\_bnb](https://www.reddit.com/u/symbiotic_bnb/) banned me from their board so that I couldn't comment his reply and provide more information about the unethical requests made by their exchance [r/binance](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/)

Here my answer:

Please feel free to spread the information. I will contact more media if they don't want to fix this.

\---

Thanks [u/symbiotic\_bnb](https://www.reddit.com/u/symbiotic_bnb/) for having banned me from your board [r/binance](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/) [r/BinanceExchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/BinanceExchange/). However I will reply on other boards to let everyone know about your abuse.

You wrote:

>""Risk Control."" This can mean many things, and most often it simply means that we have identified unusual activity on your account that may indicate a third-party has gained unauthorized access and withdrawals were suspended to protect your assets.

Nice. So I remember the steps done:

1. Last year opened my Tier 0 account (Non verified, just Email, 2FA set)
2. on same day deposited 0.21BTC
3. 3-4 months later back, I login to my account from a new machine, but same country. I m asked to verify email, I receive code, login successully, same 2FA.
4. I sell some of assets, then I withdraw you cancel it for ""Risk control"" and force me to upgrade my account??? why???? seriously???

**If you dont want people to use Level 0 accounts (unverified with KYC, 2 BTC limit), then just don't offer that option!! force everyone from scratch to submit KYC. Simple!**

**Don't allow people to use the service, then randomly you force them to provide verification. We have a right of** [r/privacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/) **!**

And now if you force me to verify my account to be able to withdraw my funds, it's my right to choose HOW I verify it. Regardless if my son, brother or sister or whoever does it for me, its verified! End! Now I know you will call this ""illegal"" but what you are doing is as well illegal in this case! Don't try to find bs reasons for that behaviour.

Your forced me to verify my account, so my account has been verified, as my screenshot is showing. Don't create new reasons to keep my money by asking things I can't provide.

When you ask me to provide video recording of how I load btc in my account, 4 months back, how sick is this? It sounds for me as a torture to find ways to keep money of people. A kind of trap.

You comment:

>Case in point: is there a particular reason why someone else attempted to KYC your account a day before your attempt? Typically, legitimate customers do not cycle through various individuals for their KYC attempts. It's interesting that you made no mention of this anywhere, given how obvious it is that this is cause for concern, especially considering that the other individual that submitted KYC for ""your"" account has been involved in malicious activity on our platform.

First, what do you mean here with ""legitmate customer""?? I was using, as your system allows, an unverified account, which was more than enough for my needs. So what is then ""legimate customer""?? So do you mean now, all your users who don't have level 2 verified accounts are not legtimate? interesting point...

Now about the verification which has been done after your ""illegal"" action to force me to upgrade the account to be able to access my account, only because I changed the machine.

Indeed 2 verifications have been done. The first verification has been rejected by Binance because the passport was not the latest updated passport of my country. Though the passport is still valid, binance verification rejected it. So what option did I have from that moment? I spoke with customer service and they couldn't help.

So what should I have done from that moment? Just abandon my hard earned money with binance for this? Even the drive license was rejected. It's a lot of money. So I asked my friend who had a newer passport to verify the account for me. And the account was verified successfully!

If you call this ""illegal"", then you are not different at all, you are exactly the same! You lock customers in a wheel while having their money, then forcing them to upgrade to level 2. This is illegal! Then you again you complain when the account is finally verified!

Next you start asking what customers can't provide to have a way to keep the money.

>That said, Binance has no interest in ""stealing"" anything from any of its customers, but we surely aren't going to allow bad actors to freely operate on our platform. You may simply respond to the ticket from here forth.

really? so you are the good actor and I m the bad actor right? Congratulations! :-)

Sorry this does not give you the right to keep my coins. If so, it's simply called SCAM. You don't like me? No problem, give me my money, and close my account.

Don't find pretexts to keep the money for you.

**Imagine that this exchange is doing this shit every day, randomly to customers, customers who don't want to provide their KYC (and it's their right! don't call them bad actor! You are Superman!) will simply abandon their money, do you know how many boost revenue is it for them? Nice way to make money** [u/symbiotic\_bnb](https://www.reddit.com/u/symbiotic_bnb/) [r/BinanceExchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/BinanceExchange/)

>For any normal customer reading this, support is extremely busy due to recent market conditions and new interest pouring into the market and some tickets may take longer than intended to address, but that doesn't mean that there is any ill intent behind the delay. If you go an extended amount of time, such as 3+ days, with no response to your ticket, you may speak with the live support on our website and request an update.

Sorry but I have been patient enough! After I opened the ticket, your CS was fast enough to reply and make insane and unethical request. Since it has been 12 days, that I sent different emails, no response. Now you found better excuse! When you contact live support, they said ""in few hours you will get answer"".

>If you are unable to provide anything that customer support asks for, all you need to do is respond to the ticket and explain what you are unable to provide and why you are unable to provide it. There are procedures in place for nearly every situation, support does not simply give up after the first step if a customer is unable to provide something that is not always guaranteed to be known.

Objection! I already replied, 12 days, no single answer from your team. What other option did I have?? See the screenshots I posted earlier, its clear enough!

>Posting on Reddit is the last stop once all other options have failed. Keep in mind that you do not need to embellish or over-exaggerate your situation to get assistance. Simply be reasonable and you will receive the same in return.

Exactly! All other options to solve this issue directly with you have failed! I have to tell my story here. And see, you replied fast.... 12 days you / your CS didn't reply to my emails.

You asked me to be reasonable? I think I'm very reasonable. Treat well your customers and with respect if you want to get the same in return. Simple life's rule.

**You can scam me if you want. I expect you to release my money and close my account. This is the correct way if your company is serious.**

You can donate to **any** of the hundreds of charities supported by The Giving Block, and /r/Bitcoin will match it.

(There are also [significant tax benefits to donating crypto](https://thegivingblock.com/resources/tax-help-crypto-donations/).)

Let's change the world for the better! [**Donate here**](https://thegivingblock.com/campaigns/rbitcoin/). Make sure that you donate on that specific page, or your donation won't be matched. Whether or not you donate, let us know in the comments which charities supported by The Giving Block you think are the best.

--------

**About the ad fund**

In 2010-2011, the previous top mod of /r/Bitcoin collected BTC donations with a vague idea that this BTC would be used to promote /r/Bitcoin and/or Bitcoin itself using AdSense ads or something like that. About 22.5 BTC was collected, at the time worth less than $300. When he resigned and made me top mod, he also gave me the MyBitcoin account containing the ad fund. (I luckily moved the BTC out of MyBitcoin right away... a few weeks later they ran away with everyone's BTC.)

In the past, some of the other mods used parts of the ad fund to promote /r/Bitcoin by sponsoring some eSports tournaments and by buying some Reddit ads. But I was personally never very interested in the whole ad fund idea, and there haven't been many other people interested in spearheading ad-fund projects, so the remaining ~12 BTC has been sitting around collecting dust for the past several years. I decided this year to finally empty the ad fund, and this donation sponsorship/matching event seemed like a good way to use the BTC for something worthwhile while also maintaining the spirit of the ad fund.",522,2021-11-30 14:34:38,1517
USDT,Bitcoin,CHANGELLY FROZE MY $49000 WORTH OF BTC/USDT.,"Hi , im in the crypto market since 2017 i buy/sell/trade/hold cryptocurrencies since then I have proofs from my very first wallet. 

Recently (October 11-12,2021) I tried to SWAP about 0.8540 BTC TO USDT ON THE LEDGER WALLET NETWORK. It's not the first time i swap a coin to USDT on my ledger thru CHANGELLY from my ledger , I did it 4-5 months ago with ETH to USDT and everything went smooth because it was 200$ only lol not worth it for them to freeze it.

In this case , the BTC was sent to CHANGELLY wallet address and CONFIRMED on the blockchain network BUT my USDT swapped coins were put and still are ON HOLD. I sent an email to the security team @ CHANGELLY and they replied in less than an hour saying that my transaction was flagged and put on hold.

They said I needed to complete KYC procedures and Live Selfie thru a third-party website link in order to release my transaction/funds/coins. Personally, i don't mind doing the KYC steps so i did it right away after receiving their email to get this issue fixed.

I sent my personal information , my Driver's license and completed the Live Selfie step. Once i finished , the verification status was VERIFIED AND COMPLETED !

Then i received a second email from CHANGELLY saying they've received my documents and that we're almost done!

They also asked me to send proofs (receipts, screenshots or bank statement) that I own the coins which I  also did and sent every proof i could find since my BTC were bought
with FIAT CASH from a seller i know personally in my city. They asked me additional small questions and i always replied in less than 30 minutes because since this issue  I'm very worried and anxious about my money so I'm always refreshing my email for any new update .

Its been 1 Month already since the KYC was done and i still haven't got my transaction released or any update of my case with 
r/changelly

When i email them to ask for updates , they always reply with a similar copy/paste message saying that my case is being reviewed and that they will update me right away once its completed

So i started to search for reviews about their company on reddit and it seems many people had the same issue with them before but many refused to send their KYC info so they couldn't get their coins back. I did KYC , so why is it taking forever to complete my transaction ? 

i sent them multiples emails asking them to cancel the swap transactions or refund my 0.8540 BTC back in my LEDGER segwit, i haven't received any reply from them concerning my request they keep on ignoring me.

I'm very worried and anxious after reading different reviews  from different cases because I never had to wait that long for a crypto transaction. It looks like they want people to give up on their money because they will make you go thru hell and nightmare if you try to get your money back.

I need help from the bitcoin community this is unacceptable … imagine waiting for the ATH in the bullrun to cashout your profits and an exchange decides to freeze your funds without explanations and even after providing KYC documents. Now they have my money ,my personal informations and im here stuck with NOTHING !",23,2021-11-09 02:52:25,34

A user-friendly crypto exchange platform that enables users to buy or sell USDT using Euro or Pounds with a straightforward interface. 

1. Sign up and KYC: integrating industry leading KYC provider

2. Buy or Sell USDT: Once the KYC process is complete, users can enter the amount of USDT they wish to buy or sell. allows users to choose their preferred currency, either Euro or Pounds, for the transaction.

3. Payment Information: Users provide their payment information to match their selected currency. For buying USDT, users can provide their Euro or Pounds payment details, whereas for selling USDT, users need to deposit the USDT and provide their payment information for receiving Euro or Pounds.

Premiums and Reference Prices:  implements a percentage-based premium for both buying and selling USDT. The premium can vary depending on the transaction amount, with lower amounts incurring a higher premium. The reference prices for USDT can be fetched from a reliable third-party source, such as Google, or manually inputted in the  backend.

Simplified D2C Model: utilizes a simplified Direct-to-Customer (D2C) model, eliminating the need for complex order matching. Instead of matching buy and sell orders,  maintains a pool of USDT available for sale. Any USDT bought from users is added to the pool, and this process is repeated continuously.

Fiat-Free Approach: does not hold any fiat currencies, Instead, the platform operates solely with USDT. Customers do not have fiat wallets; they only need a USDT wallet for transactions.",0,2023-05-26 21:20:49,3

Reasons why I want to use Phemex is because of lower fees, you can short, use leverage.

But one of the things is, that Phemex is a B book exchange, so apparently the insider desk trades against you. I'm just trying to figure out if this is a good idea or not.

I'm currently looking into how to trade BTC into a stable coin like USDT but without having to use a regular exchange that requires KYC. so i've been looking into DEX solutions. 

I've looked into Shapeshift which looks very interesting. But in trying they currently have a bug which means I cannot connect w the Ledger. They've said they're fixing it, but WHO KNOWS how long that will be.

I've also looked into Orion Terminal, which also looks very interesting, but to be honest it's not super clear to me how to do that trade. Via which wallets to connect the Ledger - and the different trading fees involved in different currencies.

I've been looking into this for a couple of days, if anyone has recommendations, it would be hugely appreciated!

USDT,Bitcoin,Do Tether control the peg of USDT by printing more when demand is high? Or is the peg set by market faith? Please help me settle this once and for all!,"Many people seem to think that Tether control the price of USDT by printing more if demand on the exchanges goes up, and burning it when demand goes down.        

     
This is quite clearly wrong in my opinion. The price of Tether is effectively pegged by the way they sell it for $1, and promise to buy it back for $1. The market has faith in this promise and therefore values it at around $1. It is not a true peg, but it is effectively pegged due to market faith.         
    
I have argued this point with people many times but it just goes round in circles, they usually give up as they cannot provide any proof, logic or reasoning as to why they are right, but their opinion remains unchanged and so they continue spreading it around the forums.          

I am hoping that this thread can settle this in peoples minds once and for all, as it is important to realise that the USDT peg is purely a psychological one that rests on Tethers promise of buying it back. Without that, USDT is free-floating.           
**So, is USDT pegged by a) controlling the supply, or b) because of the price Tether sell and promise to buy it back for?**

A day I was watching a BTC rich list and exploring the addresses. I'm unsure how exactly it happens because I verified the address, but when I sent 1 BTC I did mistakenly to the wrong address!!! I verified that I was sending to the correct address, but I had to remake the sendship because the wallet crashed, probably there was the problem, the huobi's cold wallet address was in the clipboard. Anyways I don't have certainty how it happens.List:  [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)

It was a mistake, I work often sending and receiving BTC. When you do a certain task all the days copying wrong data could be a **TERRIBLE** but **EASY** mistake to do, because we are humans and we fall in the trust. **As you did a task correctly many many times you earn trust on yourself and try save time.** If it didn't happens to you ever you aren't being honest.

For the record, market caps are $282B and $17B atm for BTC and USDT, respectively. If one assumes an actual cash-in fraction of 6% of the market cap for BTC (rest would be valuation), the two would hold equal amounts of fiat investments.

The most likely scam *scenario* is that USDT is in fact not completely backed by liquid $. Please: this is a what-if question, a mere thought experiment, and not intended to bash particular individuals, the Tether Co. or anyone else. It is also not about quantifying the likelihood of this this scenario.",2,2020-11-09 08:38:26,13
USDT,Bitcoin,Binance scammed me 1516 USDT with unethical verification requests! Then rejected my real verification with stupid reasons! Stay Away from this Scam Exchance! (Latest Review),"Hello guys,

may be you remember the story I posted here recently about HOW BINANCE is SCAMMING me 1516 USDT  
If not you can review it here:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/g08w53/binance\_scammed\_me\_1516\_usdt\_with\_unethical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/g08w53/binance_scammed_me_1516_usdt_with_unethical/)  


Here is the final update. I'm not here anymore to try to beg r/binance to refund my money, as it's already clear that they scammed. I want just want awareness about the shit exchange.  


In short, r/binance r/BinanceExchange and their manager u/symbiotic_bnb SCAMMED me my 1516 USDT.

They wanted me to send my real documents, provide some video I must record for them. I did all they requested and they replied saying ""no, it's not you, you got documents on darknet"". My godddd, so I went to darknet, I bought docs from people and requested them the videos, how sick are these people? I don't even know where is that darknet ( Smybiotic may be you can teach me).

**When I insited, they told me they are expecting from me UK documents because I was connecting using UK IP wowwww**

**I was using indeed UK private proxy to use my unverified account**, and even if not, whats the relation with my IP when using unverified account?

These guys are simply SCAMMER!!!!!!!!!!!  


Binance, one more time you WON, CONGRATULATIONS. Keep scamming people like you do everyday.",0,2020-06-08 12:04:30,16

USDT,Bitcoin,Transferred bitcoins to USDT account - Bitcoins lost...,"Hi all,

I want to reach out to you because I'm getting desperate about bitcoins I sent to my account back in 2017 which never arrived...

In short:  
I bought 0.2 bitcoin back in 2017 via BTCdirect. I thought being clever to send them to my USDT account in Bittrex as it could take some time untill they arrived on my account and doing so I wanted to avoid the fluctuations in the market. How could I know that usdt accounts could not receive bitcoins?... (Now I do...). However, they never arrived in my account.

I tried to contact the Bittrex support several times but they allways waved me off and told me that the amount of bitcoins was to small to take the risk and try to recover them.

Besides the fact that I don't believe that it's difficult to recover the bitcoins - I would think that the advantages of blockhain would make it easier to recover them - some other strange things came to my eyes when I dive in the transaction again:

In the blockchain I can see that the bitcoins arrived in my account at 2017-10-22 21:50. However, about 3 hours later, at 2017-10-23 00:57, the same amount was sent in 2 transactions to 2 adresses: ±0.005BTC to adress 1 and ±0.186BTC to adress 2.  
However, both transactions do not appear in my order history on Bittrex.  
Furthermore both adresses have allready received a huge amount of bitcoins so I suppose this is a Bittrex account.

I'm a bit desperate right now as it seems like I'm completely depending on the help of Bittrex. Therefore 2 questions for you:

\- Do you think it is easy/possible for them to recover the bitcoins?  
\- Which other steps can I take to try to recover the bitcoins?

Allready a big thanks to everyone who takes the time to read my post and formulate an answer! Much appreciated!

Best regards,

MM",3,2021-01-20 13:28:25,10

USDT,Bitcoin,"Breakdown: ""financialization"" of Bitcoin through alt markets and USDT?","I'm seeing responses to  this selloff focus on the SEC's decision to postpone the ETF. People are saying things like ""how is it possible that postponement of a decision can lead to  a selloff like this? "" I can't be the only person unsatisfied with the lack of a clear answer to that.

Part of the answer I'm providing to myself is that **there is more than one reason we are selling off right now.** I'm entertaining the possibility that the SEC decision isn't even the most important factor in this selloff.

## If the selloff isn't caused by the ETF decision then why did they happen at the same time?

Shit happens. Sometimes events trigger moves in markets that have been set up for a long time. The result of something like that is a systemc breakdown. Sound familiar?

Also, the selloff started July 29th, well before the decision to delay. The selloff and the SEC's decision to delay seems to be irrationally linked by some; Sure, the selloff continued and picked up speed, but there's no reason to believe that the market wasn't primed to do that already.
 
## What else is important?

Volume is important. More specifically, where capital is flowing to and from.

https://coinlib.io/global-crypto-charts?theme=dark#global_money_flow

We're seeing alt hoarders sell everything (including their BTC) into tether and cashing out to fiat (look at the volume moving in and out of the Yen!!!). We're probably losing about 100 million tether a week from the system right now. 3 weeks ago there were 2.7 billion. Today there are 2.4. That's substantial because money that's leaving the system through tether may not come back.

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/

If nobody is depositing cash to buy tether then all tether can (and will?) leave the CC ecosystem. That's 2.4 billion USD of bear pressure available... and I'm starting to believe that can sell out.

*(Tether's interaction is much more complex than I'm illustrating, but for rhetorical purposes I'm keeping it short. You can't argue that less available tether has no impact on market when there's a 10% swing in 3 weeks that coincides with a huge selloff.)*

## What happens without economic incentive to create more tether?

2.7 billion less liquidity is a big hit to the total CC market cap. I'm not even sure how to estimate the impact, but it will be substantially more than a 2.4 billion USD drop in the net CC market cap. 

## Consider the CC space without tether. 

If alts aren't relevant to this selloff then why are they dropping in value faster than Bitcoin? Why have they been losing market cap for months?

You're watching the network effect of cryptos break down when tether leaves because without it you will observe deviations between exchanges that are 10% or more. We had tools to measure that kind of thing 2 years ago that don't even exist today. Today, exchange prices are so close that there's no reason to pay attention to it.

Arbitrage bots become more prominent in a world without tether... and a world with more arbitrage bots is a world that is much less efficient. Less efficiency means less profit and less upside potential on every trade.

## Financialization?

To understand what I'm getting at you should [listen to this podcast](http://www.bitcoin.kn/2018/08/caitlin-long-financialization/) or [read this article on forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinlong/2018/08/07/racing-to-fix-wall-street-ice-cryptocurrencies-and-enterprise-blockchain/#268ab665215e).

A sort of financialization has already occured in the CC space by way of alts and tether and the market is just starting to grasp the implications of that. If tether is gone, or so scarce that it might as well be, your options to cash out in most alt markets is probably limited to Bitcoin. 

**Think of the size of that squeeze.**

Similarly, if alts are less prominent in this space then there is less demand on available Bitcoin because there are fewer altcoins (which also have less value). As the alt market shrinks so does the demand for Bitcoin... but the Alt market also shrinks because everyone knows that there is more claim to bitcoin by way of altcoin market caps than there is Bitcoin to go around.

## Wow. Big claims there, Mr. Hates-All-Alts

First, I don't hate all alts. I'm categorically opposed to shitcoins. I'm not up for discussing what qualifies as a shitcoin to me, but I will admit that much bias.

Second, the amount of disgust some people show, when I suggest that economic activity in alts may be somewhat culpable, is telling. I'm happy to discuss details that I'm missing, but I don't think everyone is rationally engaging with the information that's available. 

When I read emotional responses, like the ones I've been getting in the daily discussion at /r/BitcoinMarkets , I'm prone to asking questions. So, feel free to get emotional; but please be able to support your emotional response with observations, facts, and or quality arguments. Trying to discredit what I'm saying by slandering me isn't doing anybody any favors.

**Please be patient and help me think through this with you.**

USDT,Bitcoin,Are You or Anyone You Know Both Long BTC Spot and USDT Perpetual Futures Right Now?,"I'm wondering how many people are both hodlers and long USDT futures right now.  I guess I'm thinking of two things:

1. What's your rationale for taking leverage and liquidation risk to gain the leveraged position instead of using that capital for spot BTC hodl where you can't be liquidated?

2. If you are willing to take liquidation risk but also are holding spot BTC, what's your rationale for hodling any spot BTC and not just using that capital for leverage?

Note this question is specific to USDT denominated BTC futures not the BTC denominated ones since you still hodl your BTC in that case.

I figure a common answer would be ""risk management"", but I guess I'm more interested in further detail than just that general reason.

To some people, leverage is an evil way to lose your BTC or capital that could be held in BTC.  To others, leverage is a way to compound your BTC equivalent stack faster if you are one of the few who can net leverage profit in the long run (this almost always involves people who take only modest leverage).

USDT,Bitcoin,Why USDT is real money,"Well, as real as fiat money in a FRB system can get.

When you wire USD over to Coinbase and they credit you ""real"" USD into your account, do you actually believe that for every dollar that is displayed to you, a dollar is sitting in a vault somewhere? The money that Coinbase, or any other financial institution with a bank account, is holding in your name, is lent out almost entirely the second it hits their account. Your claim on your money is only as good as the liquidity and the percentage of foul loans the bank Coinbase partners with is.

More than 90% of the currency in circulation is created by bank credit. 

Tether/Bitfinex does nothing else. They take out loans at a bank, with their company as collateral and the money that is created, yes out of thin air by issuing credit, like it is *always* done, is then tokenized as USDT.

If you are skeptical about this, good. FRB and credit money is fraud and shouldn't exist. But it's nothing new and it's not something special. In a way, I would trust Bitfinex and Tether more, because they know they won't get bailed out when the SHTF, so they're probably more cautious.

Btw, the only company that I know where you can hold USD, EUR,... and they actually hold physical bank notes in a vault in the same amount for you, is GoldMoney.com. (and no, I don't work for them, I'm just a customer)",0,2018-01-31 07:07:16,20

I buy bitcoin hourly. And I think it’s the best DCA strategy so far.

My strategy.

I don’t have strike or likewise exchanges in my country that charges my card hourly.

So I buy a stablecoin (USDT or BUSD) lump sum every month in binance through p2p. I hunt for verified sellers with best exchange rates. Because it’s local bank transfer, I get no spreads due to conversions, no card fees, totally free p2p experience.

I then use the auto-invest feature binance provides.

Every hour until my next payday, the assigned USDT gets auto converted to BTC with a fee of 0.2%. Which is really nothing!

For example, I am charged only $10 in auto-invest fees for a $5000 transaction, split into every hour.

($5000 is just an example, no one should hold that much stablecoins in a centralized exchange)

And once the BTC reaches a significant amount, I transfer them to my trezor.

Good morning again ladies and  gentlemen and welcome back to my daily look into the king of crypto...  Bitcoin! Today I have the daily time frame pulled up after tumbling from  support. Things look pretty bearish considering. Now that we lost some  key support what is next for the King of Crypto? Can we reverse this  mess we're in? All that and more on this episode of trading with Tim...   


Okay  so the elephant in the room. That is the figure of speech I should use  today I imagine. We lost the slightly ascending support of the bear flag  (or channel) we have been in since May 19th. No surprise there. This is  a continuation pattern which is just a continuation of the previous  trend. We dropped, consolidated briefly. Faked out a few bulls.  Ultimately we dropped from the support. The writing was on the wall...

&#x200B;

""Writing  was on the wall"" Tim you sure say that a lot... What does it mean?""  Well that means the resistance was so stacked that nobody in their right  mind would have expected the bulls to overcome the bears in this  situation. The bears had the advantage and will for the next few weeks I  imagine. At least until we can get these indicators to seperate. The 50  MA needs to move away from the 200 MA and the 100 EMA etc... All those  indicators are currently stacked right on top of each other and as a  result the confidence necessary to break through resistance that we are  experiencing is just not there.

In a few weeks  hopefully these indicators will no longer be directly on top of one  another. But that requires that the candles either drop significantly  from here or they go up. Either way that would make the 50 MA stray from  the 200 MA and the cloud. This would allow resistance to sort of  unstack itself so to speak. Does that mean bull run is back on? Not  necessarily. That is just the first step in turning this market around.

Now  that we lost the support of the bear flag where is the next support?  Well looks like we are about to test 30k. It has held since January  basically. But the more we test this support the more likely it is to  fail. So if 30k fails there is plenty of support below us but 25k is  among the more likely supports to hold its ground IMO. But 20k is  absolutely the strongest support below us at the moment. I know 20k is  something none of you want to hear but the writing is on the wall :)   


I  hope you can all enjoy the red candles. You can profit off the red  candles just like the green ones. You get USD on the way up (green  candles) and on the way down it's a great opportunity to increase your  Bitcoin. This will put you in great shape the next time we make a break  for 6 figures. ETH is at 1800, we are already testing 30k. It is likely  to fail IMO. So be prepared.

USDT,Bitcoin,BTC/USDT Ascending,"BTC/USDT 4hour candle.

This represents a lovely looking ascending triangle with a top of 12k.  This ascending triangle was given a lot of strength a few hours ago with the recent sell that bounced of the 55EMA, (shown by arrow).

So the rule of an ascending triangle is to break upwards out of them, with the longer the squeeze within the triangle the more violent the breakout will be.  This isn't guaranteed and could breakdown out of this pattern, however with the recent wick and buyback.  My money is we breakout of this structure.

Triangle suggests breakout within 96 hours.

Next stop 14k yum yum

USDT,Bitcoin,"Sent mistakenly 1 BTC to Huobi's cold, please help me to contact CEO (7 months!!)","Hi everyone, 7 months ago I sent mistakenly 1 BTC to the Huobi's cold wallet. Yes, I'm retard, I feel terrible.

&#x200B;

**Transaction**:

[https://www.blockchain.com/es/btc/tx/4769c93d8c9e0d5eaf8311ac8af513e23096ae461da0256a77cf70ca73fd4e4b](https://www.blockchain.com/es/btc/tx/4769c93d8c9e0d5eaf8311ac8af513e23096ae461da0256a77cf70ca73fd4e4b)

&#x200B;

**How I send mistakenly 1 BTC to the Huobi Cold Wallet?**

A day I was watching a BTC rich list and exploring the addresses. I'm unsure how exactly it happens because I verified the address, but when I sent 1 BTC I did mistakenly to the wrong address!!! I verified that I was sending to the correct address, but I had to remake the sendship because the wallet crashed, probably there was the problem, the huobi's cold wallet address was in the clipboard. Anyways I don't have certainty how it happens.List:  [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)

It was a mistake, I work often sending and receiving BTC. When you do a certain task all the days copying wrong data could be a **TERRIBLE** but **EASY** mistake to do, because we are humans and we fall in the trust. **As you did a task correctly many many times you earn trust on yourself and try save time.** If it didn't happens to you ever you aren't being honest.

**7 months talking with Huobi Customer Support (part 1)**

I tried to contact Huobi's customer support. First they first didn't understand me, thinking that I tried to deposit on Huobi and sent to a wrong address. After they understand they told me that the address doesn't belongs to Huobi and they can't help me. That is false, I did an investigation and they have direct relation with this address, they can help me. Read my following analysis please:

&#x200B;

**Huobi Ownership Analysis**

Searching, sites says that the address belongs to Huobi Huobi support says that address doesn't belongs to Huobi

I don't know if belongs to Huobi or not, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi

Why? The address 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 regulary sent big amounts to 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D

Then, is VERY PROBABLY THAT 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 OWNER KNOWS 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D OWNER And the 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D OWNER can help me.

Searching, some sites (and sites like USDT Official page [https://web.archive.org/web/20181113185656/https://wallet.tether.to/richlist](https://web.archive.org/web/20181113185656/https://wallet.tether.to/richlist)) says that the address 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D belongs to Huobi

Again, I don't know really if the address is of Huobi, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi

Why? On my Huobi account I made only 2 BTC withdraws from Huobi in the past

2018-05-08 18:36:45 , txid: 0e6bf02323ebc166b6638afcd6170ecb73948748235e687def7e7a3cb1902fca , it has 239 inputs 2018-05-08 20:17:10 , txid: b59b988d642fe3773268e246ef1a0d048bbd3f734a611d00722b39126ed9e20b , it has 239 inputs too

In both transaction, all inputs are addresses that BELONGS TO HUOBI, because you huobi are sending me BTC

Both transactions has 39 addresses as inputs in common (all huobi address, maybe deposit addresses of anothers huobi users)

Example: 1M9ndPSQ4fmMKaKW2oX7LtjduDqYUcFKCW

**7 months talking with Huobi Customer Support (part 2)**

After understanding this , they asked me my consent to pay a fee. I agreed. After they asked me sign a message with my privates keys. I did it. And finally they tell me ""Wait"". I'm waiting 7 months ago, all months I ask and they ever reply the same ""We will contact you"". Now they told me "" Hello，sorry for the inconvenience, we feedback your problem to our technology department.  After a series of research and development, but it can not be solved.  Please understand this.  ""

I want to think that the team is failing and Huobi isn't wanting steal my BTC. What they are doing maybe could be illegal. I'm thinking to talk with lawers on Singapore, I don't know what more to do.

I tried to contact the CEO Livio on Twitter ( [https://twitter.com/livio\_huobi](https://twitter.com/livio_huobi) ) but they don't reply me! I want to think that someone else is administering their account.

USDT,Bitcoin,"Bitfinex (Tether) implies it's exchange is listed in USD, but it's in USDT (tether)","I am am a verified customer on Bitfinex. [This is the message I get when I check their info on USD](https://imgur.com/su7TM0j). This is what I used to think when i decided to move most of my funds with them: that they pair with USD. This is why I moved there in the first place.

But they don't, all their pairings are in USDT and *just assume* parity with USD. That's the cause for the premium, the same premium seen on all other major exchanges [(Binance, OKex, Huobi etc... basically all top 10 exchanges by volume)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/).

No, there is no market on Bitfinex for USDT:USD (even if there might have been in the past, i don't remember). USDT is USD and USD is USDT.

When you send USD to Bitfinex (or eur and convert) you get USDT. You basically automatically buy their coin. When you long or short crypto there, you do it against their own stable coin that they vouch for. The crypto market is priced against another crypto.

There's now two parallel markets for Bitcoin, one USD denominated, another USDT denominated. And the major market is the USDT one, which is nothing but a leap of faith in Tether. I don't think I have to explain how volatile and risky such a situation is.",6,2018-10-21 14:49:12,12

USDT,Bitcoin,Can someone please explain why not to try and sell BTC for USDT as a temporary measure against the likely dip?,"Transaction fees are minimal if timed right, and there is no need to complicate taxes because USDT is a cryptocurrency, so it's not switching to fiat.

Now here's the question. We are approaching 5000, and have already noticed a minor correction. Many people are expecting a significant dip (though of course nobody knows), but most of all it's very unlikely for the BTC value to suddenly triple at this point without first passing 5000 at a more gradual rate.

So why not transfer your BTC to USDT to maintain your value while the expected dip comes, then buy back the BTC when the price is lower? I realize this is timing the market, but at the moment it seems pretty time-able. If the dip turns out to be nothing, just hop back in at ~5,100 (since we'd be past the psychological milestone). Yes it'd be a small loss, but potentially a higher chance of securing your funds.

Can someone please explain why this is a bad idea?

USDT,Bitcoin,Why is USDT being forced upon me when I try to buy bitcoin on WazirX? (India),"1. I’ve created an account and funded with a nominal amount to begin testing. I want to eventually own Bitcoin, Ethereum and some Monero but when I try to buy BTC with the INR fiat I’ve deposited, it suggests P2P And then forced me to buy USDT before anything else.
Is this normal or am I screwing up somehow?

Do I HAVE to buy USDT to buy any other crypto?

2. I’m being asked to create an XID before I buy anything. Sounds like a username. I read somewhere that it can be max 15 and min 4 characters but it doesn’t mention the max.
Should this XID be easy like “ Investo145” so that it’s convenient to share and seems like a real user or difficult like “48jec72swkcd7dv4gt” in case it works the same way as a password and provides security.

3. I had to do a shitload of KYC, much more than my bank account to create an account here. Are there any other options where no ID as required. Will the one you recommend allow fiat funding? What are the fees for sending and receiving crypto for that one. 

4. What’s the best free beginner wallet I can use if I’m going to invest ~50000 INR (650 USD) the first year. Wallet should have negligible or free fee to transfer out my crypto to another wallet once I learn more.

So the naysayers say this run this year is due to a Bitfinex USDT-caused exit pump, whilst those who believe that the pump is genuine are more likely to cite institutional interest as the case: funds front-running BAKKT, Ameritrade, etc.

Is there evidence one way or another?

Also… is a Bitfinex / USDT collapse even a major risk to the system anymore?

Soon we will have BAKKT and other institutional grade platforms coming online to offer trading to firms and high net worth individuals – I just don’t think Bitfinex & USDT poses anywhere near the systemic threat to the system that it historically might have done.

USDT,Bitcoin,BTC/USDT - Aurox Trading Platform,"Good morning everyone 

Just thought I would share my thoughts with you all

&#x200B;

Good morning everyone and welcome to my daily analysis of Bitcoin.  Today I have the 4hr time frame pulled up and I can see that the 9 week  trend held through the night. We bounced from 8800. I had a feeling that  would be the case. This uptrend we have been in since March 13th. All  good things do eventually come to an end though and uptrends are no  different. This weekend is also a holiday weekend in the US and as a  result the weekend could be boring if people decide to ditch the laptops  and get to the newly opened beaches around the country. Lets take a  look at what the chart is telling us.

**I added an indicator to this chart that I thought some of you  may like. This is an Aurox exclusive indicator and its mainly for those  that have trouble performing TA or just want a little assistance in  your decision making skills. The indicator is called ""Aurox Indicator""  and its under the indicators tab. Click indicators and then click on  advanced indicators and you will see a list of a few neat indicators but  the Aurox indicator is what I have on here and I really think its  useful. I turn it on often to clear any doubts I may have. Red arrows  indicate a sell recommendation and the green arrows indicate where they  suggest a buy. Give it a try!!!** 

I have a white line I started at the dip 9 weeks ago to 3800 and the  uptrend has been continuous since then. We tested this white line (trend  support) numerous times over the past 9 weeks. at least 5 touches by my  count. That is a pretty decent trend and it has outlasted plenty of  trends I have traded in the past. Like they always say... The trend is  your friend. At least until it isnt. Trends eventually reverse and if  you arent prepared you will be left holding those heavy bags. This is  why trading a trend is a great idea but always use a stop loss.

This price range on the chart is pretty tricky folks. We are  constantly testing support on multiple trends. A 2 month old trend and a  1 year old trend are both playing a part on the charts. We are also in  consolidation and inside of the weekly cloud and the 4hr cloud as of  right now. Being inside of the cloud can be confining and hinder the  candles from moving much.

I see some room for a rise as the RSI is pretty low at the moment and  that could provide us with the fuel we need for another small leg up.  If we did rise the 4hr 50 MA is around 9500 and I would assume this  would be where we experienced some resistance. We have finally filled in  the gap from last weekend completely now so there is no need to worry  about that gap anymore.

This weekly close looks to be a bearish candle with a decent  correction from approximately 10k. If we can keep this range up it looks  like we are still above the 1 year trend resistance which is hopefully  where we can refuel and launch from the elevated launch pad. Otherwise  the bears can take us down to the weekly 50 MA (8800) Which has been  reliable support for the past 3 weeks. With so many variables on the  chart and a possible reversal of the trend on the horizon I would enter  any position with extreme caution folks. But then again WTFDIK right????

TLDR: Bitcoin is teetering... Bulls and bears are locked in a fight  for dominance and we may see a trend reversal very soon. Its been long  over due if you ask me. Of course that halving luster could still  surprise us I imagine but Im not holding my breath. Long weekend coming  in the US so be prepared for anything folks.

USDT,Bitcoin,Bitfinex printing billions of fake USDT and buying all Bitcoins available in exchanges !,"we are all happy with bitcoin price spike however many of us feel there is something upnormal behind this pump

checking the omni chain Bitfinex is printing billions of USDT tokens and buying all BTC available in exchanges so the price pumped > 13k

This is very unhealthy in a few days they will control larger portion of bitcoins available

For example they Just printed $100,000,000 USDT 10 hours ago

another $100,000,000 printed 17 hours ago 

That makes four days in a row where they printed 100 Million in fake money a day.

# Introduction

*BabyTether is a new token in the Binance Smart Chain network, which allows each holder to receive permanent passive earnings, paid in $USDT.*

*What could be more stable and more confident than receiving rewards immediately in $?*

*Every week, tokens appear that pay rewards to holders in the form of other tokens (BNB, CAKE, ADA, AVAX, Dogecoin and so on). You depend at once on the price of two tokens: on the token that you are holding and on the other token in which you are credited with rewards. Of course, you can immediately sell the second token and convert it into dollars, but these are unnecessary actions, an unnecessary waste of attention and inconvenience. Especially if you are relaxing somewhere on the islands, drinking Pina Colada. Or you can hold the token that you receive as a reward, but this is an additional risk. The risk of the market falling, respectively, of this token.*

*Our team really likes the idea of ​​projects that pay rewards to holders immediately in the form of stablecoins (USDT, BUSD). But in reality, there are very few such high-quality projects on the market. That is why we are here!*

*Think about it. Why do you need extra actions? Why do you need additional risk, which is already enough in cryptocurrency? We do not see the need for this and are more inclined towards stability, to constancy. And there is nothing more stable in cryptocurrency than stablecoins. Regardless of the market, whether it goes up or down, you will always know that you have dollars in your portfolio that you can always use in real life. Better yet, when the market falling, you will have the funds to buy back the altcoins (which other projects offer you as rewards, haha) at even lower prices.*

*BabyTeather is not just a meme token, without functionality. Our team wants to make a great story out of this project. Something like BabyDogeCoin.. A wonderful project and wonderful admins. And we intend to repeat their success, but in a much more stable and acceptable form for ordinary people.*

*If you give a choice to an ordinary person who is not very familiar with cryptocurrency to buy a coin and receive rewards for it in CAKE/BNB/Dogecoin.. or in $, what will he choose? The answer is obvious. And our mission is to distribute BabyTether not in a narrowly focused way only in the cryptocurrency community, but by embracing a large number of ordinary people who are just starting to study the cryptocurrency world.*

# Features

# Dividend Distribution Mechanism

The dividend mechanism incentivizes token holders to hold in order to earn dividends from the transactions (buys and sells).

    The dividends are not dependent on the price of BabyTether. They are based purely on the volume and proportional to the BabyTether amount you hold in your wallet.

* All $USDT the contract gains are split proportionally between the token holders
* To receive dividends a minimum token balance of 200,000 BabyTether is required to be held in a wallet
* The contract keeps track of all the dividends due to each holder in a list
* Every transaction processes a certain number of users from the list
* The number of holders processed through each transaction is dynamic and based on transaction size
* Holders will receive dividends from the queue based on their position in the list
* It’s a fair system, fully automated

# Security

**The BabyTether team has taken several steps to ensure optimal security:**

1. The liquidity pool is locked for 12 months using the PinkSale platform
2. BabyTether contract address has been audited by one of the most popular and trustworthy companies CERTIK: [https://www.certik.com/projects/babytether](https://www.certik.com/projects/babytether)

Cryptocurrency is a form of payment that can be exchanged online for goods and services. Many companies have issued their own currencies, often called tokens, and these can be traded specifically for the good or service that the company provides. Think of them as you would arcade tokens or casino chips. You’ll need to exchange real currency for the cryptocurrency to access the good or service.

Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain network built for running smart contract-based applications. BSC runs in parallel with Binance’s native Binance Chain (BC), which allows users to get the best of both worlds: the high transaction capacity of BC and the smart contract functionality of BSC

Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized technology spread across many computers that manages and records transactions. Part of the appeal of this technology is its security.",954,2022-02-24 06:41:10,74

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Tether Printer JUST LAUNCHED,"&#x200B;

30 MINUTES SINCE LAUNCH 💸💲 Tether Printer 💲💸 \[$200K MC\] The money machine with unique, innovative tokenomics 140 HOLDERS

&#x200B;

\# Tether printer

Are you tired of finding out about tokens when half the world has already bought in? Do you have so many rugs in your wallet that it looks like a discount furniture store? Does the very prospect of making money evade you like you have covid? Well, it seems that TetherPrinter is for you.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\## Why is it different?

We believe that when it comes to tokens, tokenomics is the most important aspect of a token, right after its community. Based on these two axioms, we decided to do some technical and psychological research on several key aspects related to these topics, culminating in Tether Printer. We believe have come up with a set of rules that will punish early dumps and bots while substantially rewarding hodlers in a more meaningful way than other coins.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\## Print-o-nomics

Each transaction is charged a fee of 15% out of which:

♻️ 10% is shared among all token holders.

💧 5% is added to liquidity.

&#x200B;

This makes Tether Printer deflationary while passively rewarding those hodling, which in turn keeps the printer whirling. Brrrrrrrrrrr!

&#x200B;

\## Anti-whale by design

Maximum hold per wallet limited to 300m tokens, with a transaction cap of 100m. This means whales can't throw their weight around.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\## Marketing Plan?

We plan on getting listed on coingecko and CMC soon. After securing more funds, we will be running paid ads on Poocoin and Twitter, as well as partnering up with Crypto Youtubers. We will also further increase our target audience by branching out to more platforms once a strong community of holders has been established.

The Revolve gaming mechanics and token utility are delivered through the Revolve Games galactic metaverse. 

Inside the Revolve Multiverse, players can enjoy the fully-functioning inter-planetary sandbox where their performance and skills earn them RPG tokens, which are tethered to the NFTs. This is a first for P2E gaming as it introduces a whole new way to earn crypto while playing. 🕹 Players are are fully in charge of their own gaming experience and can choose between staking their RPG tokens for more perks inside the Revolve metaverse or owning unique NFT assets in a variety of categories. The better the player’s performance or the more popular a developer’s game inside the Metaverse – the more staking rewards of a given tethered actionable NFTs they’ll receive! 

The Revolve Games fantasy world was developed by Dutch Game Studio, the Polygon and BSC chains. The cross-chain compatibility and subsequent integration with Chainlink’s VRF mean users can enjoy a provably fair and verifiable source of randomness. Chainlink VRF can serve as a tamper-proof RNG to build reliable smart contracts for any applications, which rely on unpredictable outcomes. 

We’ve built a robust Metaverse whose growth anyone can contribute to! An SDK will allow developers to create their own game builder asset packs, games or parallel metaverses within the main Revolve Games multiverse. Each metaverse will have its own unique style, with NFT assets being interoperable between metaverses. Upon traversing metaverses, users can travel with their NFT tethered spacecraft, buy land on planets, shape the landscape, fight, explore and play many additional games. 

Holding RPG-tethered NFTs will earn more revenue to keep up with competitors. NFTs will retain their value in terms of development and strategic importance. 💪

The new Metaverse of Revolve Games offers more than just a digital escape; it's creating a decentralized player-owned economy, where users are well compensated for their skills and performance in the game's ecosystem. 

Follow us on our social media channels to stay on top of all updates and new developments and get a glimpse of what galactic storytelling really is!

\# Tether printer

Are  you tired of finding out about tokens when half the world has already bought in? Do you have so many rugs in your wallet that it looks like a discount furniture store? Well, it seems that TetherPrinter is for you.

\## Print-o-nomics

Each transaction is charged a fee of 15% out of which:

♻️ 10% is shared among all token holders.

💧 5% is added to liquidity.

This  makes Tether Printer deflationary while passively rewarding those  hodling, which in turn keeps the printer whirling. Brrrrrrrrrrr!

\## Anti-whale by design

Maximum  hold per wallet limited to 300m tokens, with a transaction cap of 100m.  This means whales can't throw their weight around.

\## Marketing Plan?

We  plan on getting listed on coingecko and CMC soon. After securing more  funds, we will be running paid ads on Poocoin and Twitter, as well as  partnering up with Crypto Youtubers. We will also further increase our  target audience by branching out to more platforms once a strong  community of holders has been established.

Why tether when you can print $Cake directly into your wallet by holding $CakePrinter? 

Play prediction! Enter the lottery! Stake your tokens in the auto-compounding pool! The options are almost endless with the $cake that will be printed directly into your wallet.

But, community is everything in crypto, which is why we have decided to take a different approach with this token in order to get the community more involved and make sure we have diamond hand holders! 

Without dedicated holders, it is impossible for us to effectively market the token. If the token dumps instantly, it becomes very difficult for us to convince more people to invest.

For this reason, the token will get more and more legit as we reach different market caps (and you earn a bunch of cake). And rest assured, if our community bands together and holds, we can take this to the moon.

Based on these two axioms, we decided to do some technical and psychological research on several key aspects related to these topics, culminating in Tether Printer. We believe have come up with a set of rules that will punish early dumps and bots while substantially rewarding hodlers in a more meaningful way than other coins.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,“The revolution won’t be televised; it will be memed.” — Brock Pierce,"Welcome to the epicenter of a meme coin revolution that bridges decentralized finance and meme culture. The $ANUS token isn’t just a meme—it’s a Super Meme designed to reshape the future of liquidity and digital assets. With a community-driven takeover, $ANUS is building a bridge that connects memecoins, NFTs, and Bitcoin—the ultimate store of value. As Elon Musk famously said, “Whoever controls the memes, controls the universe.” And $ANUS is set to do just that.



**What Makes $ANUS Different?**



 1. Black Hole of Liquidity (Launching Soon):

Prepare for a gravity-defying technology that will make $ANUS the liquidity hub for meme coins and NFTs. Our Black Hole tech will create a powerful bridge, making it effortless for projects to access Bitcoin’s value and stability, just as Tether transformed liquidity in the broader market.

 2. Super Meme Status: The Ultimate Bridge for Digital Assets:

By morphing into a Super Meme, $ANUS is more than just a token. It’s the first meme coin to integrate real-world liquidity solutions, allowing memecoins and NFTs to anchor to the ultimate store of value: Bitcoin.

 3. RocketFuel Contracts: Stake Your Claim:

Fuel our mission to Uranus by locking in your $ANUS tokens and earning exclusive staking rewards. RocketFuel Contracts will support the project’s growth while rewarding the community.

 4. Snapshot Milestones: Align with Cosmic Forces:

Our carefully timed snapshots align with key lunar phases, rewarding loyal holders with NFTs and staking bonuses that symbolize our shared journey to becoming the ultimate Super Meme.

 5. Ecosystem Expansion: Building a Super Meme Network:

We’re actively partnering with tech innovators, community leaders, and influencers to expand the $ANUS ecosystem. These partnerships will increase visibility and bring tangible value to our holders.



**What’s on the Horizon?**



As we grow, $ANUS will evolve from a memecoin to a fully-fledged platform that provides liquidity and utility for digital assets. Our community-driven roadmap ensures that every step forward is aligned with our vision of becoming the bridge between meme culture and decentralized finance. With each new innovation, $ANUS will cement its status as the gravitational center of the meme coin universe.



**Join the Revolution:**

Are you ready to be part of the $ANUS gravitational pull? As we continue our journey to Uranus, we invite you to join a community-driven movement that is transforming the future of finance, one meme at a time. This is more than a token—it’s a revolution.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Floshin 🚀 launched yesterday | $2.1m MCap | Debit Card | DEX | Escrow | Stable Coin | Governance Platform | Whole set of DApps 💖,"**About Us**  
**FLOSHIN** Token is designed for investors looking to make their cryptocurrency work just like any other form of capital, such that they can ensure a return on investment in any market. FLOSHIN is dedicated to providing a complete set of decentralized applications which increase profitability, safeguard security and extend to real-life use cases like fiat currency. We believe that to be competitive, we need first to cover the most popular decentralised applications and at the same time be ambitious for the new ideas. 

Following Decentralised Applications will help us in taking cryptocurrency in real-life use cases like fiat currency:  
‍  
1. Automated market-making(AMM) decentralised exchange(DEX) with adverse farm and built-in Cross-Chain routers.  
2. NFT Marketplace - we already have a list of 200+ artists, and over 10k+digital arts which will be listed on our marketplace website immediately after the launch.  
3. Floshin Stable Coin, which will be pegged to the US dollar.  
4. Interactive Crypto Wallet.  
5. We will be partnering with a debit card issuer and issuing Floshin Debit Card  
‍*(Floshin holders can apply for the debit card subject to KYC checks)*.  
‍6. Our Escrow Contract will replace the middle man, which will be used in our marketplace similar to Amazon and Shopify. Both buyers and sellers will be able to use our Escrow contract to trade. The physical goods protection in transit will be covered by the third-party insurance purchased by the buyer while initiating their trade.  
7. Governance platform for any DeFi token. 

**Tokenomics**

✔️ 3% to holders in BUSD  
✔️ 3% add in liquidity pool  
✔️ 2% for marketing and development

**Unique Selling Point**  
FLOSHIN Token is developing a powerful community by offering debit card solutions. Our stable coin will be capable of being traded between sellers and buyers with sustainable commission which will be cheaper than Tether and DAI. Tether has a 0.5% commission + an exchange fee. Whereas FLOSHIN Stable Coin will have 0.05% commission + an exchange fee.  
‍  
Our wallet will operate in a similar process as PayPal and Stripe by allowing merchants to register an account that can be used to perform transactions with our stable coin in a safe and anonymous background.  
‍  
With the crypto merchant account and our Escrow contracts when used together will provide buyers and sellers security and transparency with the cheapest transaction cost possible in the current market.

**Token symbol:** $MOLLARS

**Where/How to buy:** [https://www.Mollars.com](https://www.Mollars.com)

**ALERT TO TRADERS:**  *Do not buy into the drainer scam. If it’s not ‘Mollars.com’ it’s not legit.*

**Token type: ERC-20**

**Blockchain:** Ethereum

**ICO Token Price \[opening round\]:** US$0.30

**Amount of tokens available in ICO:** 4,000,000

**Summary:**

Sharing some exciting news about the ongoing Mollars ICO that kicked off on November 21st. 🎉 Mollars, an Ethereum-based token, is stirring up the crypto scene with its Initial Coin Offering priced at US$0.30 per token. This presents an enticing opportunity for investors eyeing significant ROI.

*What's Unique About Mollars?*

Unlike many tokens in the market, Mollars is positioning itself as a store of value, following in Bitcoin's footsteps. Interestingly, the founder has no personal token reserve, a rarity in today's crypto landscape. The commitment to full decentralization and releasing all tokens to the market ensures a unique longevity for Mollars.

*Anticipated Returns & Exchange Listings*

With its debut on Uniswap anticipated upon reaching the US$2 million milestone, the listing day price could soar to US$0.62, delivering over +200% ROI to early investors. The current daily buy rate indicates growing interest, and the buzz around Mollars' potential growth is on the rise.

The recent release of the white paper and a clear mission statement by the founder are fueling this excitement. There's even talk of expanding the Mollars brand through a new product, which could be a game-changer.

*Looking Ahead: Projected ROI by 2024*

Developers project a bright future for Mollars, aiming for a second-quarter 2024 listing on a major exchange at US$0.625. With potential developments in the WEB3 product realm, experts believe Mollars could exceed this value, possibly reaching US$1.875. If this happens, early investors could reap yields of over +600%!

*ICO Details & Tokenomics*

The ICO is divided into 4 funding rounds, each offering limited tokens at incremental prices. The earlier you invest, the lower the token price. However, even later rounds promise substantial ROI post-listing.

Post-ICO plans involve a rapid listing on a top exchange, expected to catapult Mollars' visibility and attract a fresh wave of traders.

For more information and to participate in the ICO, check out the Mollars whitepapers here. Hurry, as the rounds are limited!

Summary:

Hey everyone,

I've come across an interesting token called Mollars ($MOLLARS) that seems to be gaining traction in the crypto space. Let's break down the key details together:

Store of Value Concept: Mollars is being highlighted as a store of value token and has received attention from credible sources like CryptoPotato. Despite cautionary Reddit posts about potential scams, let's rely on trustworthy sources such as the official website and endorsements by Crypto Potato to understand it better.

Unique Proposition: Mollars aims to achieve complete decentralization, boasting robust security, popularity, and a capped total supply. They claim to have a mathematical formula designed to potentially boost its value over time as the available token supply diminishes.

Trading Anticipation: When Mollars hits Uniswap, it's expected to experience an initial surge in trading price by around 200%. The estimated listing day price is approximately US$0.62.

Utilization of ICO Funds: The ICO funds will be allocated to a well-structured marketing strategy executed by a team of professionals. The goal is to sustain consistent growth in token value across four quarters in 2024. Additionally, no tokens will be held off the market, validated through public audits, potentially averting unexpected fluctuations in token supply.

Potential Performance: Mollars might outshine Bitcoin in terms of transactional value, especially with ongoing enhancements to the Ethereum blockchain.

Current Status: Around 16,000 tokens have been sold, amounting to approximately US$5,128. They plan to make 4 million $MOLLARS tokens available during the presale.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Mollars ($MOLLARS) ICO | Store of Value ERC-20 | SOV Token for Ethereum Blockchain | Avoid Scams Utilizing The Mollars Name,"Token name: Mollars   
  
Token symbol: $MOLLARS  
  
Where to buy: [https://www.Mollars.com](https://www.Mollars.com)

Hpe y’all are having a great time in this crazy crypto market. I've been winning 5 years now.  Recently got notice of a new ICO token that I chose to invest in, and I thought I’d help spread the good work on $MOLLARS.

First off, don't be fooled by off-brand sites and lnk.tree domains; **If it's not** **Mollars.com****, it's not official.**

Mollars, identified by the symbol $MOLLARS (official website at [https://www.mollars.com](https://www.mollars.com)),  operates on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token and commenced its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) at an initial price of US$0.30. A total of 4,000,000 tokens are available during this ICO phase.

# Here are key aspects of the Mollars project:

*Store of Value Approach:* Mollars aims to function as a store of value tokens, positioned to become a reliable and secure digital asset.

**Credible Recognition:** The token has received recognition on reputable platforms such as CryptoPotato, emphasizing its potential and significance within the crypto space.

**Decentralization:** Mollars is built on a decentralized model, ensuring no centralized ownership, and is designed to be completely transparent through public audits.

**Limited Supply:** With a capped total supply and a unique mathematical formula to appreciate value over time as supply diminishes, Mollars offers a distinct approach to maintaining and potentially increasing its value.

*Strategic Marketing Plan:* The project has outlined a strategic marketing plan funded by the ICO, slated to roll out over four quarters in 2024 to drive consistent growth in token value.

*Future Prospects:* Leveraging Ethereum's blockchain advancements, Mollars aims to position itself favorably for transactional value compared to Bitcoin.

If you're curious and want to explore or invest in Mollars, head over to their official website. I’ve seen some scams trying to impersonate the project, so please stick to their official website and pages.

The token can be purchased using Ethereum ($ETH) or Tether ($USDT). The launch of the first decentralized exchange (DEX) is scheduled for May 1, 2024, or within 45 days of hitting the hardcap, with an anticipated listing day price of US$0.62.

But remember, always DYOR, hope all the best for y’all. Peace ✌️

**PUMP Token**

$PMP is a revolutionary new token that is the first in ALL of DeFi to pair 75% of xSurge's $xUSD in LP as a backing asset. $xUSD is a stablecoin that only appreciates in value, giving pumptoken a unique stability unlike anything else seen on the BNB Smart Chain. A potentially revolutionary investment, Pump Token will be a technology demonstrator for the future of decentralized stablecoin backed assets. For a primer on $xUSD and what it is, visit buytherise.com

**WTF is $xUSD?**

$xUSD is DeFi's first ever appreciating and decentralized stablecoin that never goes down in price. Buys, sells and transfers all RAISE the price. Interestingly, because of the wrapping mechanism inherent in $xUSD, buys and transfers raise the price linearly, however, selling the token actually raises the price exponentially.

$xUSD's real-world utilities generate revenue on its own via staking, lending, yield farming, mining, and arbitrage. These utilities create a paradigm shift from immediate price action to a sustained base APY that appreciates over time, all while abiding by XSurge's core truths:

* Every Buy, Sell Or Transfer Raises The Price
* Over 100% Liquidity Backing

$xUSD cannot be compared to a stablecoin like Tether. $xUSD is fully collateralized, and it’s immutable. For example, if 100 people bought $xUSD, and then 99 of them sold, the last man standing would not only walk out with full value, but would walk out with the best price. Ironically (and quite extraordinarily) a huge selloff of $xUSD would cause the price to go parabolic in the upwards direction.The characteristics of $xUSD make it the PERFECT token to back ANY project on the BSC. No matter what is happening with $PMP, $xUSD will always be going up in the background. This is vitally important because ALL tokens go through bearish stretches and low volume periods. $xUSD is the hedge against a down market and low volume.

**Why Buy Pump?**

**1. $xUSD backing and rewards:**

In addition to being backed 75% by $xUSD, $PMP gives 50% of all tax revenue back to our holders in $xUSD rewards.The longer you hold $PMP, the more rewards you will accumulate. And getting rewarded in a token that cannot fall in price increases the incentive to keep on stacking those rewards and creating passive income.

$PMP is the FIRST token to pair such an extraordinary amount of LP in $xUSD, but it will not be the last. Within a couple years, $xUSD will be THE premiere backing asset in all of the BSC. $PMP holders will be the beneficiaries of every single project that uses $xUSD after it.

**2. Arbitrage:**

$PMP will launch with TWO liquidity pools! Why? Because we can profit off of price balancing between the two pools (arbitrage).

Our exclusive PumpBot (powered by XSurge’s Arbie) will be FEE EXEMPT, and will arbitrage the two pools 24/7. 90% of all arbitraged profits are returned back to $PMP. This is an external revenue source for $PMP that will not require the token to be actively traded. We can use that money for advertising, giveaways, buy and burns, wherever we feel the money can be deployed best….and the service is FREE for us, we pay nothing to use it.

**3. The Pumpstarter:**

The Pumpstarter is our exclusive Treausry deployment model. We will allow our own community to participate in deciding the future direction of $PMP! The community is a HUGE part of $PMP’s identity, and we want them actively engaged in deciding the best deployment of the Treasury’s funds.

Initially, all Treasury funds will be housed in $xUSD for safekeeping, so the Treasury will begin to grow right at launch.

**4. Future projects:**

Although we cannot divulge exactly what’s next in store for $PMP, we are actively working on the next three or four phases of the project. The whole game doesn’t begin and end with the launch of $PMP. $PMP is just the beginning.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,"dexIRA (DEX) ✖️ Just listed on CoinMarketCap & CoinGecko ✖️ Trending within 4 hours ✖️ Featured in Yahoo Finance, Marketwatch, Coinspeaker & more ✖️ Don't miss this sleeping giant!","What Is dexIRA (DEX)?

&#x200B;

dexIRA provides fully automated multi-currency dividend rewards, advanced buyback protocols and tokenomics that promote long term holding and wealth generation. 

&#x200B;

🚀 Rewards holders in BNB, BTC, ETH, LINK, DOT, DOGE, SAFEMOON, ADA, BUSD, SAFEMOON and MORE! 🎊

&#x200B;

The platform is based on the synergy of two concepts: DEX (decentralized exchanges) and IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts). Borrowing from the long-term investment idea behind a traditional IRA, dexIRA investors can grow their holdings commission-free similar to tax-free IRA contributions. This allows members to increase their stake in the reward pool over time without sacrificing initial capital. 

&#x200B;

After a one-year holding period, investors can sell their $DEX holdings tax-free and penalty-free. However, similar to the age restrictions on a traditional IRA, if holders choose to sell early, they're penalized. 

&#x200B;

Investors are protected even when $DEX tokens are sold and the price drops because they are rewarded with two thirds of all fees collected. Similarly, the dexIRA contract includes enhanced token buyback protocols to spur growth and anti-whale measures to prevent large one-off sell orders.

&#x200B;

KEY FEATURES OF $DEX:

&#x200B;

✅ $DEX holders earn multi-currency rewards – they're able to pick from a whitelisted selection of curated cryptocurrencies (e.g., BNB, BTC, ETH). These rewards are auto-claimed for added convenience.

&#x200B;

✅ $DEX buyers pay no fees or taxes, which promotes long-term investment.

&#x200B;

✅ $DEX sellers pay a 30% sell fee, which discourages speculative trading. After one year, the 30% sales tax is waived.

&#x200B;

✅ Advanced protocols recognize when a sale is made. The contract then buys a portion of the sold tokens back to relieve sell pressure, and burns those tokens.

&#x200B;

✅ Percentage of all sell orders contributes toward automatically generating further liquidity.

&#x200B;

WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT $DEX?

&#x200B;

The strategy is simple: Incentivize new investment by waiving fees when purchasing dexIRA tokens. Support long-term growth by providing rewards and penalizing speculative short-term traders. 

&#x200B;

dexIRA was created to shift the mindset of investors and prove that cryptocurrencies can be stable, value-appreciating assets if the tokenomics support a long-term investment goal

&#x200B;

Buy $DEX tokens without fees, use them to automatically collect and manage a diverse array of curated tokens in the following cryptocurrencies: BNB, BUSD, BTCB, ETH, DOGE, CAKE, XRP, LITE, LINK, DOT, ADA. SAFEMOON, ATOM, MATIC, TETHER, 1INCH, BUNNY.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,"$MOLLARS Initial Coin Offering | Token Presale | Be Aware of Copycat Scams | CryptoPotato, CNF, Blockchain Reporter, & Others Have Mentioned This ICO","🚀 Introducing Mollars ($MOLLARS) - Your Next Store of Value Token!

DO NOT FALL FOR THE SCAM, linking to ""Lnk.tree"" . It's a 'drainer' ICO that's copying the name of this oirignal project.    Only trust the .com site (not offbrand domains) OR follow the project being mentioned by Crypto Potato, BCR, and others are mentioning (Links at bottom of post)

**🔍 Token Info:**

Token Name: Mollars

Token Symbol: $MOLLARS

Where to Buy: [Mollars Official Website](http://www.mollars.com)

Token Type: ERC-20

Blockchain: Ethereum

ICO Token Price \[Opening Round\]: US$0.30

📈 Why Mollars Might Interest You:

Mollars is being hailed as a store of value token with some impressive features:

Decentralization: Fully ownerless, making it secure and resistant to central manipulation.

Mollars' decentralization ensures that all tokens are in circulation and subject to public audit, preventing unexpected supply shifts that could impact its value. Furthermore, its development on the Ethereum blockchain suggests the potential for better transactional value compared to Bitcoin.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,"Mollars ICO Now Live | Store of Value Token | ERC-20 | ~.09% of Tokens Sold & Buy Rate Uptrending | Mentions From CryptoPotato, BCR, More | Beware of Copycat Scam That Will Drain You","**Cryptocurrency name:** Mollars

**Token symbol:** $MOLLARS

**Where is the presale? (where to buy) :** [https://www.Mollars.com](https://www.Mollars.com)

**Token type:** ERC-20

**Cryptocurrency Blockchain:** Ethereum

**ICO Token Price \[opening round\]**: US$0.30

**Amount of tokens available in ICO:** 4,000,000

***WARNING:***  There's a scam token that's going to drain accounts being promoted here  that is not the official Mollars token.  If it's not the '[Mollars.com](https://Mollars.com)' website it's not legitimimate. Dont trust the 'lnktree' scam.

**Summary:**

Mollars ($MOLLARS) initial coin offering has launched.

This is a store of value token as featured on CryptoPotato:

[https://cryptopotato.com/mollars-ico-what-you-need-to-know-about-ethereum-blockchains-new-bitcoin/](https://cryptopotato.com/mollars-ico-what-you-need-to-know-about-ethereum-blockchains-new-bitcoin/)

Avoid the ‘fraud’ posts on reddit about this token and only trust the official website.  Only trust who Crypto Potato mentions.

How/Why is Mollars a store of value token? It’s going to be completely decentralized (ownerless),  secure, popular,  have a capped total supply, and developed with a supreme mathematics formula to increase value over time as the max available supply depletes.

Upon release on the decentralized exchange Uniswap, value of the token will start public trading at an incline in value of \~200%, based on listing day price.

A predetermined marketing plan will be secured from the ICO funding that will be executed on a structured schedule by a professional team.  This is expected to give the token value a consistent upward growth for 4 quarters in 2024.

The total decentralization (no ownership) means that no tokens will be held off the market and will be verified via public audit.  This will help prevent sudden shifts in supply or losses of value from unexpected increases in available token supply.

As the Ethereum blockchain improves, this  means Mollar could perform better than Bitcoin in transactional value.

Nearly 16,000 tokens have been sold to date,  which value US$5,128 as of today.    4-million $MOLLARS tokens will be made available in the presale.

**How to buy:**

To purchase Mollars (MOLLARS), visit the official website linked to above.

Crypto investors can purchase the token with Ethereum ($ETH) or  Tether ($USDT).

**Initial Cryptocurrency Exchange Listing ?**

The Token will launch on its first DEX on May 1 of 2024 or within 45 days of hardcap being reached.

**DEX Listing Day Price:**   US$0.62

Why tether when you can print $Cake directly into your wallet by holding $CakeMeDaddy?

Community is everything in crypto, which is why we have decided to take a different approach with this token in order to get the community more involved and make sure we have diamond hand holders! 

Without dedicated holders, it is impossible for us to effectively market the token. If the token dumps instantly, it becomes very difficult for us to convince more people to invest.

For this reason, the token will get more and more legit as we reach different market caps (and you earn a bunch of cake). And rest assured, if our community bands together and holds, we can take this to the moon.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,"People Are Saying That When the market bounces back the OG memes will be next because they are familiar, safe, and viral. In your opinion, what will be the next meta?","Greetinfs fellow degens! Let's talk about why OG memes are about to recapture the crypto world.

In a sea of volatility, OG memes stand out for their relative safety and risk-reward benefits. Unlike fly-by-night coins (celebs and stock tracking memes) these memes have stood the test of internet time already, building communities and loyalty along the way. This isn't just about nostalgia; it's about the power of community and recognition. Investing in meme-based crypto taps into a pre-existing fanbase, offering a unique blend of humor, nostalgia, and investment potential. For existing meme coiners, OG memes offer a safer harbor in the stormy crypto sea and for newbies it is a new way to make crypto fun. OG memes arent just a flash in the pan; they're a testament to the enduring power of internet culture in shaping investment trends.

In my opinion Monkey Haircut ($MONK) is an ideal meme coin because it has that OG meme feel but is also timeless because it can be funny to newcomers as well. It's not tethered to a bygone era or a niche audience. It is also being reinvented and a re-memed constantly with the latest trends. The community is decentralized and active.

There are so many reasons to like MONK but I want to hear what others think.

Is it going to be politifi again? More celeb coins? Something else?",14,2024-06-14 14:12:12,17

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,$BOG - BogTools / Bogged ARG,"Ok guys so I wanted to wait a minute before I posted anything about $BOG because the past run was crazy, we all know how Sundays are so I wanted to see what happened before I posted some info on it. But this period of consolidation has pretty well confirmed this is going to blast off. Full disclosure I have a small amount but I will be buying more when I can deposit some cash tomorrow. 

The QRD on BOG: BOG is an ARG token which runs code each time it is executed for various use-cases, including real-time and historical oracles on BSC.

Lightpaper: https://boggedfinance.medium.com/the-bogged-protocol-lightpaper-16c7394e250f

Site (coming soon): https://bogtools.io/ 

ARG Site: https://bogged.finance

Pancakeswap: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xd7b729ef857aa773f47d37088a1181bb3fbf0099&inputCurrency=BNB

What does $BOG do?
Each transaction of BOG uses a small amount of the users gas to execute code on the Binance Smart Chain to continue to keep BogTool applications running 24/7.

The BogTools that have been publicly announced are: - Price Oracles and Historical Price Chart for any BSC token. (Releases in 1 week.) - Limit Sell/Buy on Pancakeswap (Deploys an oracle, or uses an existing oracle, and monitors price and executes a trade if the price is met.) - Whale Auto-Tether (Changing your BNB into BUSD when it detects a whale sending lots of BNB to a Binance wallet.)

Why is this revolutionary? Nobody before this has figured out how to run code on the blockchain continuously in such a way. The developers themselves don’t even know the kind of tools they’ll be building in a few months for this platform.

How do BOG holders benefit? The payments for the BogTools are paid in BOG and the majority of the fees will go back to hodlers/stakers.

Why the ARG? The ARG encourages transactions to be made on the BOG ecosystem.

This is amazing, and the rapid growth has been intense to watch. I already has a $1.8m marketcap at the moment.

What do y’all think??

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Pump Token - Gempad Presale Sold Out In 42 Seconds,"**LAUNCHING 6/5 AT 7:00 P.M. UTCPRESALE SOLD OUT IN MERE SECONDS**

**The HYPE for PUMP is REAL! We sold out on Gempad in 42 Seconds!**[**https://gempad.app/special/0xB272e4ac4c1b7b3C918D82a8d793a3975AD71bED?chainId=56**](https://gempad.app/special/0xB272e4ac4c1b7b3C918D82a8d793a3975AD71bED?chainId=56)

**Visit** [https://t.me/PumpOfficialGroup](https://t.me/PumpOfficialGroup) **to get all the details!**

**PUMP Token**

$PMP is a revolutionary new token that is the first in ALL of DeFi to pair 75% of xSurge's $xUSD in LP as a backing asset. $xUSD is a stablecoin that only appreciates in value, giving pumptoken a unique stability unlike anything else seen on the BNB Smart Chain. A potentially revolutionary investment, Pump Token will  be a technology demonstrator for the future of decentralized stablecoin backed assets.  For a primer on $xUSD and what it is, visit [buytherise.com](https://buytherise.com)

\------------------------------------

**LAUNCHING 6/5, 7:00 p.m. UTC**

**KYC’d**

**Audited**

**Doxxed**

**Gnosis Multi-Sig Wallet**

\------------------------------------

**WTF is $xUSD?**

$xUSD is DeFi's first ever appreciating and decentralized stablecoin that never goes down in price. Buys, sells and transfers all RAISE the price.  Interestingly, because of the wrapping mechanism inherent in $xUSD, buys and transfers raise the price linearly, however, selling the token actually raises the price exponentially.

$xUSD's real-world utilities generate revenue on its own via staking, lending, yield farming, mining, and arbitrage. These utilities create a paradigm shift from immediate price action to a sustained base APY that appreciates over time, all while abiding by XSurge's core truths:

* Every Buy, Sell Or Transfer Raises The Price
* Over 100% Liquidity Backing

$xUSD cannot be compared to a stablecoin like Tether.  $xUSD is fully collateralized, and it’s immutable.  For example, if 100 people bought $xUSD, and then 99 of them sold, the last man standing would not only walk out with full value, but would walk out with the best price.  Ironically (and quite extraordinarily) a huge selloff of $xUSD would cause the price to go parabolic in the upwards direction.The characteristics of $xUSD make it the PERFECT token to back ANY project on the BSC.  No matter what is happening with $PMP, $xUSD will always be going up in the background.  This is vitally important because ALL tokens go through bearish stretches and low volume periods.  $xUSD is the hedge against a down market and low volume.

**Why Buy Pump**

**1. $xUSD backing and rewards:**

In addition to being backed 75% by $xUSD, $PMP gives 50% of all tax revenue back to our holders in $xUSD rewards.The longer you hold $PMP, the more rewards you will accumulate.  And getting rewarded in a token that cannot fall in price increases the incentive to keep on stacking those rewards and creating passive income.

$PMP is the FIRST token to pair such an extraordinary amount of LP in $xUSD, but it will not be the last.  Within a couple years, $xUSD will be THE premiere backing asset in all of the BSC.  $PMP holders will be the beneficiaries of every single project that uses $xUSD after it.

**2. Arbitrage:**

$PMP will launch with TWO liquidity pools!  Why?  Because we can profit off of price balancing between the two pools (arbitrage).

Our exclusive PumpBot (powered by XSurge’s Arbie) will be FEE EXEMPT, and will arbitrage the two pools 24/7.  90% of all arbitraged profits are returned back to $PMP.  This is an external revenue source for $PMP that will not require the token to be actively traded.  We can use that money for advertising, giveaways, buy and burns, wherever we feel the money can be deployed best….and the service is FREE for us, we pay nothing to use it.

**3.  The Pumpstarter:**

The Pumpstarter is our exclusive Treausry deployment model.  We will allow our own community to participate in deciding the future direction of $PMP!  The community is a HUGE part of $PMP’s identity, and we want them actively engaged in deciding the best deployment of the Treasury’s funds.

Initially, all Treasury funds will be housed in $xUSD for safekeeping, so the Treasury will begin to grow right at launch.

**4.  Future projects:**

Although we cannot divulge exactly what’s next in store for $PMP, we are actively working on the next three or four phases of the project.  The whole game doesn’t begin and end with the launch of $PMP.  $PMP is just the beginning.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Goldmine Rewards - A Unique Pre-Sale Open to Everyone Right Now !!!,"Talks of Goldmine have been floating around various Telegram groups for the last few days, it’s been marketed on several channels with massive followings and word is definitely spreading. The presale is live right now and what’s amazing is it’s open to everyone!

  The only other token I’ve seen do this is Shield Token and that went absolutely parabolic, if that’s anything to go by then Goldmine is gonna go crazy too.

  The token has a real life use case too, it’s a reward token and you’ll earn BNB every day depending on how much Goldmine you hold and the daily trading volume. 

  They have clearly put SO much effort into this already, the website is looking amazing:

[http://goldmine.financial/](http://goldmine.financial/)

Another unique selling point of this token is that you’re not going to be waiting around to receive an airdrop of tokens, you can go on the website, connect your wallet and claim your rewards whenever you want!

 Need some extra BNB for gas? Tethered but need some extra BNB? Just head to Goldmine!

The open presale wallet idea is unique and incredibly advantageous as it means there’ll be a HUGE amount of liquidity in the LP prior to launch which means it won’t be nuked by big sells!

The dev has hosted several AMA’s on the Telegram at [https://t.me/GoldMineRewards](https://t.me/GoldMineRewards) and made it very clear that he knows what he’s doing! I’m honestly tempted to just throw 10 BNB into the presale wallet, it could honestly turbo moon.

  If you want to enter just send ANY amount of BNB above .1 to this wallet:

 0x9052b7773baFB4d9D3e9f63bCF5D597042041E31

 That’s right, there is 0 max buy at presale and it’s not hard capped!

 This is a crazy good concept in a space which is constantly looking for the next big thing!

 Launch is scheduled on the 10th of July at 8PM UTC.

LET’S GO!

Dogira just announced it: https://twitter.com/DogiraOfficial/status/1400346154999566340

The two crypto cat-dog favourites aim to raise a considerable amount of money for animal charities by auctioning off some unique, limited edition, specially commissioned NFTs. Considering the fan base these guys have, and the quality of the NFTs being made, this could get massive engagement, and the money raised might even make the news!

A previous auction that Dogira did with Vira-lata raised $50,000 for animal charities in Brazil. The combination of Dogira’s background in NFT marketing and Bingus’ influencer list and amazing selection of NFTs, this could really do very well indeed. All the money is going to charity!

Right now, Bingus has found a floor during the market massacre. With coins ditching and rugging left, right and centre, Bingus stands strong and keeps working even when the market tethers up. This is a great entry point for Bingus (BSC) AND Dogira (ETH).

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Mollars ($MOLLARS) Token ICO Has Launched | Hybrid Memecoin x Altcoin | WilL Launch With 1 Web3 Product as Catalyst | $2MM Hard Cap,"**Token name:** Mollars

Token symbol: $MOLLARS

**Blockchain:** Ethereum (ERC-20)

**ICO Token Price \[opening round\]:** US$0.30

**Amount of tokens available:** 4,000,000

**Where to buy:** [https://www.Mollars.com](https://www.Mollars.com)

Summary: Mollars ($MOLLARS) is a hybrid decentralized cryptocurrency that has memecoin and altcoin characteristics.  The creator will never have ownership of the token but instead use his veteran experience in cryptos to create the cryptocurrency and all things to make it functional to the crypto world.  Also, the founder has created a structured path for the token’s launch on a major Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange (DEX), alongside a strategic branding campaign.

Beyond those basics for indexing of the token, a web3 product will also be launched that requires $MOLLARS tokens for its usage. This web3 product will be a catalyst tool to help create a vivrant Mollars ($MOLLARS) subculture and boost daily transaction volume of the new ERC-20 token.

As a community-owned and driven digital currency, the founder will hold 0% of tokens.   Like Bitcion ($BTC), the token’s future price will be dependent on community usage of the token and growth of the brand.  Like Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Shiba Inu ($SHIB), there will be attractive marketing and branding campaigns.

The spine of the Mollars ($MOLLARS) token is from the original golden rule of cryptocurrency, it’s Decentralized and has no ownership.

**How to buy:**

To purchase Mollars (MOLLARS), visit the official website linked to above.    Purchase of the token can be done with Ethereum ($ETH),  Tether ($USDT), or Credit Card.

**When will it launch on DEX?**

The Token will launch on its first DEX on May 1 of 2024 or within 45 days of hardcap being reached.

.

**----  My thoughts:**

Mollars name alone is very brandable.  This could be a sizable flip if the marketing is done properly and the web3 product connects with the crypto audiences internationally.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Feel like Powell (FED) with $DEGOV - No Meme Bullshit - real world use case,"Today I introduce you to Debaseonomics and the underlying Governance Token

**Debaseonomics** is a combination of **$DEBASE**, a flexible supply token, and **$DEGOV**, a governance token, working together to solve the fundamental issues faced by elastic supply tokens. 100% of the tokens are distributed through staking and ""stabilizer pools"" to promote fairness and decentralization.

Debaseonomics doesn't aim to create another flexible supply token proposing a small set of features that might, in theory, make them reach their pegged value. Instead, it encompasses an infinite variety of elastic supply tokens by proposing stabilizer pools which can be programmed in unique ways to try to incentivize DEBASE holders to stabilize the token price over a number of cycles, in a process mediated by governance.

**How does Governance work in Debaseoconomics?**

DEGOV tokens represent a vote in the governance of the protocol. The token allows a user to propose new protocols or vote on changes proposed by other users. 

*Some of the Parameters owners can set:*

· Price Target

· Rebase Options

· Oracle 

· Stabilizer Parameters

· + 20 more (look on there website)

**„THE FUCK THIS MEANS DUDE?“**

Well, In plain and easy language, this means that the Governance token (**$DEGOV**) gives you the voting rights that the FED has over the dollar in the Debaseonomics network. The $DEGOV protocol controls $DEBASE (e.g. to dollar). (Simplified ofc, those FED mf‘s don‘t care about fair decentralization) 

**Read more about the Vision of Debaseonomics:**

**What are the advantages of price elastic tokens?**

· investors do not have to deposit collateral.

· transparent system

· no intermediaries

**Dangers of stablecoins such as Tether**

· There is no investor protection. In the event of Tether's insolvency, there is therefore no deposit protection

· Tether cannot guarantee whether the intended exchange ratio with the base asset will last

**Reasons why it's worth a look:**

· Relatively undiscovered spectrum in the crypto space, which is increasingly needed as traditional assets become less important

· Community-owned project guarantees there will be no rug pulls or fraud on the blockchain

· Interesting approach with long-term appreciation potential due to the growth of DeFi and the search for collateral (stable coins)

· GOV token allows for a variety of rights in the project and customization of algorithms for the future 

· Real Voting rights to the project and its development guaranteed by Governance token

· Low market capitalization of under $1 million - potential of over x100

· DeFi features with meaningful usecase

· S-pools for stabilization of token price

· Staking with Use-Case 

· You can feel like Powell

**Supply**  
 

*Total Supply: 25.000*

*Circulating Supply: 24989 (99,9%)*

*Mcap: 900.000 $*

**Competitors**  
   
 

The biggest competitor is Ampleforth with 320M$ market cap. DEGOV market cap is 900k$. You can calculate for yourself what potential lies behind it.

Finally, here are more links to read in and get smart. Personally, I see great value in the token for decentralization and hope that such projects will develop quickly to make humanity more independent. A token, with very little market cap, but what also has a huge potential to develop great in this bullrun. The potential is definitely there, many projects just stay under the radar. $DEGOV is one of those in my opinion.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,"Shiba Inu Burn Rate Explodes, but SHIB Price Remains in the Flux – Best Meme Coin to Buy Now?
","**SHIB Price Analysis**

Despite the impressive burn rate, the SHIB price is not performing well, mirroring the broader crypto market downturn. However, investors should not be overly concerned, as this is part of the market’s natural ebb and flow.

An analysis of the SHIB/USDT chart reveals that Shiba Inu has been trading in a sideways channel since the meme coin mania of late February to mid-March. 

A sideways channel is a period of consolidation where the price oscillates between two horizontal levels, in this case, between $0.00002 and $0.00003. The $0.00002 level has acted as a crucial support level, with the price rebounding from it multiple times. 

As the coin is currently trading just 10% above this level, it will be crucial for Shiba Inu’s bulls to protect it.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,$BRETT the #1 memecoin on BASE network,"Im scared of buying a memecoin for several thousand tether. That would cost me 40% of my total net worth. Am i doing it wrong or should I take the risk anyways? Ive been speculating this coin since march 1 and it is holding off strong, recovers from dips etc

History:

There was a recent fud where people found out that insiders have bought in the first 1h of launch, over 200 wallets, that coin, and they control (wait for it) 82% of supply.... Smells like a scam right

But there is no rug. They have just slowly been dumping over the past 60 days and took out about $3M. I guess that's fine because devs need to profit as well?

But in this case a whitelist was not a fair launch even tho they claimed it is. The coin hit 850M dollar market cap in less than 60 days, insane results. Whateverr they did they have done it right it seems

I watched it crumble after this info came out from 0.085$ to 0.022$. Massive loss. But now its holding strong between 0.03$ and 0.045$, somehow and for some reason. It even goes beyond and has potential to still go back to 0.085$ and beyond which is why i wanted to buy it for about 2K USDT.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Crypto plus eCommerce and virility equals a SQUID token? Quite an interesting presale gem.,"$SQUID Finance token is in their private sale/presale phase [seed] and looks to be quite an interesting project. What actually got me interested was the SQUID name that keeps making headlines for the wrong reason. However, a quick look under the hood of this burgeoning project reveals one of the greatest kept secret gems on the BSC, period. They’re currently very early in development of the project. The concept behind bringing together eCommerce and Defi through creating a FIAT onramp is quite unique and if implemented can really bring a lot of trust and versatility to the entire ecosystem. I should think that the team would intend to create a FIAT (USD) pool which would also be tethered to the SQUID token. An idea that simplifies investing in the tokens in defi by using a more familiar approach through eCommerce.


&nbsp;


The whitepaper shows a well thought out approach to building token holdings through investing in larger-cap cryptos and will no doubt lend well to the idea of their #justholdsquid campaign. The team clearly is knowledgeable about technical analysis and shares daily TA about largecaps in their Discord. Something that I definitely appreciate. This idea would also be an excellent way to build up locked LP for their idea for a swap.


&nbsp;


Studying the plans presented on their website, which is brilliantly setup, they show a path towards growth with impressive milestones. Launching on multiple chains to further integrate their swap is a great way for the project to bring further value to investors through consecutive launches and further spread their novel ideas. 


&nbsp;


One novel idea worth mentioning is a shared model of ownership surrounding NFTs. This is particularly impressive since the whitepaper presents many novel ideas all of which are brought to near completion clearly makes this SQUID token stand out amongst the rest. Physicalizing of the metaverse is sort of like creating a mixed reality, keeping the elements of both worlds that are beneficial and removing those that are not. This while conferring value in the form of rarity. Pretty impressive imho.


&nbsp;


The whitepaper also shows some other impressive firsts and high quality Intellectual Property which exemplifies how knowledgeable the devs are in the blockchain world. With plans for research and establishing a blockchain with built in smart invest functionality is brilliant idea and can be a standard in finance chains going forward.


&nbsp;


Hoping to shine some light on this project since if the team is able to accomplish the things set out in their missions, it can easily create a multi-billion dollar finance company that owns patents to models that can be built upon in the future. Definitely worth checking this little (for now) project out.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,I Just Aped This Here is Why : Doxxed Dev | EverBurn $EVB Hyper Deflationary Passive Income Reward Token | Next 100x Gem 1000x potential | Low Market Cap(680k),"**What is Everburn?🔥**

The Everburn project is a Hyper Deflationary smart contract reflection token hosted on the Avalanche C-Chain network.

The Everburn token burns supply on every buy and sell transaction, charges a reflection tax on every sell order, and then reflects a blue-chip reward token to its holders based on the size of their holdings.

The project is currently reflecting USDT (Tether), but also has the ability to change this reward token that is reflected by its holders based on a community vote. Everburn is a deflationary token. It burns a percentage of every transaction when it is bought or sold. Since it works by percentages, it will never run out of supply and exponentially slow down its ""burn"" rate over time. As the circulating supply decreases because of the burn rate, the percentage of all holder's portfolio size increases, which in turn raised their share of reflections reward.

**Why Everburn?🤷‍♂️**

✅🔥- Doxxed - DEV

✅🔥- Liquidity Locked for 1 Year

✅🔥- Experienced Developing Team

✅🔥- Twitter Influencers On Board & Promoting

✅🔥- Big marketing team

✅🔥- Deflationary Token

✅🔥- Total Supply will burn over time down to 0. The longer you hold, the rarer your holdings become.

After a one-year holding period, investors can sell their $DEX holdings tax-free and penalty-free. However, similar to the age restrictions on a traditional IRA, if holders choose to sell early, they're penalized.

Investors are protected even when $DEX tokens are sold and the price drops because they are rewarded with two thirds of all fees collected. Similarly, the dexIRA contract includes enhanced token buyback protocols to spur growth and anti-whale measures to prevent large one-off sell orders.

**Key features of dexIRA**

✅ Get 20% rewards

✅ Auto-claimed Multi-Currency Reflections

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Is investing in equity of a new cryptocurrency a good idea?,"I've came across this new cryptocurrency project and the idea seems solid, it is a potential competitor to Tether(and other stablecoins), but being backed by multiple profitable assets instead of a single currency. The idea seems appealing to me as it could beat inflation that FIAT backed stablecoins suffer from.  
Now, project proposes a crowdfunding round for equity and they plan to bring the company public once it achieves a bigger size, after some years, the point that makes me wonder is, if that is a good investment to make? I know that is not common in the crypto market to see equity being offered, I suppose if Tether had offered equity when was launched probably would have been good to buy it in the beginning. Could this bee the next successful moonshot?  
Here is their proposal for equity: [https://cryptopila.com/en-US/#equity-sale](https://cryptopila.com/en-US/#equity-sale)

The project works with a concept they call multi-asset-backed stablecoin, which basically means that they back the value of their token on many assets instead of a single one, this produces a price that is less vulnerable to fluctuations, say if it was only pegged in gold and gold went down, the crypto would go down, but if it is pegged in many different assets while one asset goes down others might be going up, reducing the risk of sudden changes. They also talk about a reserve fund, which they plan to use on situations where the diversification is not enough to prevent a price drop, in those cases they plan to use this fund to keep the price while the drop on prices happen, their whitepaper is very interesting with simulations of their approach against other stablecoins and common assets in the market like gold and the S&P500 index.

Beyond those basics for indexing of the token, a web3 product will also be launched that requires $MOLLARS tokens for its usage. This web3 product will be a catalyst tool to help create a vivrant Mollars ($MOLLARS) subculture and boost daily transaction volume of the new ERC-20 token.

As a community-owned and driven digital currency, the founder will hold 0% of tokens.   Like Bitcion ($BTC), the token’s future price will be dependent on community usage of the token and growth of the brand.  Like Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Shiba Inu ($SHIB), there will be attractive marketing and branding campaigns.

The spine of the Mollars ($MOLLARS) token is from the original golden rule of cryptocurrency, it’s Decentralized and has no ownership.

***How to buy:***

To purchase Mollars (MOLLARS), visit the official website linked to above.    Purchase of the token can be done with Ethereum ($ETH),  Tether ($USDT), or Credit Card.

\*\*When will it launch on DEX?\*\*The Token will launch on its first DEX on May 1 of 2024 or within 45 days of hardcap being reached.

.

*----  My thoughts:*

Mollars name alone is very brandable.  This could be a sizable flip if the marketing is done properly and the web3 product connects with the crypto audiences internationally.

You are searching for a token with a very low market cap? Check this sleeping giant.

💎 An Individual Retirement Account designed specifically for Decentralized Exchanges.

💎 dexIRA is the first token with multi-currency rewards, advanced buyback protocols and

💎 Tokenomics that promote long term hodling and wealth generation.

🚀 Rewards holders in BNB, BTC, ETH, LINK, DOT, DOGE, SAFEMOON, ADA, BUSD, SAFEMOON and MORE! 🎊

The  platform is based on the synergy of two concepts: DEX (decentralized  exchanges) and IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts). Borrowing from the  long-term investment idea behind a traditional IRA, dexIRA investors  can grow their holdings commission-free similar to tax-free IRA  contributions. This allows members to increase their stake in the reward  pool over time without sacrificing initial capital.

After  a one-year holding period, investors can sell their $DEX holdings  tax-free and penalty-free. However, similar to the age restrictions on a  traditional IRA, if holders choose to sell early, they're penalized.

Investors  are protected even when $DEX tokens are sold and the price drops  because they are rewarded with two thirds of all fees collected.  Similarly, the dexIRA contract includes enhanced token buyback protocols  to spur growth and anti-whale measures to prevent large one-off sell  orders.

**Key features of dexIRA**

✅ Get 20% rewards

✅ Automatic Liquidity Pool

✅ Burned LP

✅ Friendly Wale Buyback & Burn

✅ No mint token

✅ Anti Whale Dumps

✅ Auto-claimed Multi-Currency Reflections

✅ No Tax on Buy Orders

✅ No rebase token

✅ Sell tax removed after 1yr hodling

✅ Funds Are Safu

**Whats so special? And why is it mooning?**

The  strategy is simple: Incentivize new investment by waiving fees when  purchasing dexIRA tokens. Support long-term growth by providing rewards  and penalizing speculative short-term traders.

dexIRA  was created to shift the mindset of investors and prove that  cryptocurrencies can be stable, value-appreciating assets if the  tokenomics support a long-term investment goal

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Welcome To ProjectX,"**PRESALE ON GEMPAD**  
  
ProjectX's presale of Platinum tier is taking place on the 22nd of November at 4pm UTC!  
  
Mark your calendars and set your alarms.  
  
**INTRODUCTION**  
  
Before we dive into ProjectX's entire ecosystem we'll start it off with an introduction to help you understand what they're planning to accomplish, solutions to the problems in the space as well as a quick rundown of utilities.  
  
First and foremost, The ProjectX decentralized platform + blockchain-enabled browser securely stores and values big data (a $100T market), returning this value to businesses and individual users as fungible currency as part of their internal economy. This makes goods and services cheaper for individual users while improving companies’ bottom lines.  
  
**AIM**  
  
Their primary use case is Southeast Asia’s (SEA) #1 economy: Indonesia’s Chamber of Industry and Commerce (Kadin) is whitelisting their bridging token, $PXC, as one of only 380 legal crypts in a country of 270 million crypto-hungry users. PXC is the gateway token between ProjectX’s internal economy and the mainstream economy. This gives PXC, unparalleled utility and stability unmatched by any other cryptocurrency.  
  
Kadin aims to encourage the uptake of both PXC and their data-backed internal token, $PRX, to meet the needs of Indonesian business and commerce in terms of liquid capital and assets held. This will maintain Indonesia’s position as SEA’s largest economy through USD $Trillions in tokenized assets on our platform, all while helping Indonesia achieve net-zero emissions before 2060 — a blueprint for a sustainable economy and world. This is ahead of expanding this uptake throughout SEA, Asia and then globally within the next 12–18 months.  
  
**PRIMARY $PRX USE CASE**  
  
In order for Indonesia to earn its place as one of the world’s developed countries by 2025, the Indonesian government aims to strengthen collaboration between the government and the private sector while optimizing Indonesia’s economic potential as the leading SEA economy.  
  
ProjectX commits to supporting Kadin by granting Indonesian businesses access to their data-backed asset and currency, PRX, thereby unlocking trillions of dollars in data value to expand Indonesia’s economy in the coming years.  
  
**THE PROBLEM AND PROJECTX'S SOLUTION**  
  
USD $Trillions of untapped data value must be rapidly realized in order to meet Indonesia’s ambitious sustainable energy initiatives while stabilizing the rupiah’s historic vulnerability.  
  
ProjectX aims to assist Indonesian businesses realize USD $Trillions by facilitating the tokenization of their data as PRX, commensurate with the value of data output projected over the next 10 years by Indonesia’s rising industries. This will enable Indonesia to meet its ambitious targets of 25 percent EVs of total vehicle sales by 2030, as well as other sustainable initiatives, including Net Zero by 2060, while stabilizing the rupiah with an alternative supply of liquidity based on real market value (i.e., ProjectX’s data-backed currency, PRX).  
  
**WHY $PRX?**  
  
Critically, by implementing PRX, efficient/sustainable systems, processes, and distribution networks become the only systems that are economically viable. This is by default of the fact that PRX is backed by the data algorithms generated by these efficient systems; the more efficient the systems the more stable PRX becomes as an asset and currency, and the cheaper (and hence more profitable) the processes become and therefore the companies that implement them. This direct link between the factors of production and their asset/currency is the basis of their internal economy — the only viable economic model and currency ever suggested or conceived that is capable of stop gapping major funding shortfalls, including the RPJPN 2005–2025 and the 2030/2050/60 agendas.  
  
**TRACTION**  
  
\- ProjectX's tech and assets are designed to allow financial institutions and crypto exchanges to reduce to zero any potential exposure to poor governance, an unstable crypto/mainstream market, bad actors, insufficient assets and poor liquidity.  
  
\- They have built proven tech (Github available, prototype launched on Mac, Linux, PC, iOS, Android with 4.6 stars on Google Play/140K downloads across platforms).  
  
\- They are being whitelisted by Kadin as one of only 380 legal crypts in SEA’s largest economy of 270 million people.  
  
\- PXC will automatically be listed for trading on the PRX DEX at launch.  
  
**PRODUCT VIABILITY**  
  
There is no data-backed currency in existence, nor any technical or economic theory or concept ever proposed or conceived that can deliver one. (Hence the strong early interest in our game-changing tech and concept.)  
  
Having said that, although there is no other digital currency backed by anything (PRX is backed by AI aggregated data value and is hence uniquely stable), the nearest comparisons are stablecoins (themselves not actually stable in practice as they are often victims of financial risk contagion channels, The TerraUSD/Luna fiasco being a good recent example).  
  
These stablecoin ‘competitors’ include Tether (USDT) (in yet more hot water as New York attorney general, Letitia James, called claims Tether’s stablecoins are fully backed by US Dollars ‘a lie’), USD Coin (USDC) (this supposedly ‘immutably pegged’ stablecoin having recently lost its dollar peg while falling to a record low after the company revealed it has nearly 8% of its $40 billion in reserves tied up at the collapsed lender Silicon Valley Bank), True USD (TUSD), Binance USD (BUSD) (and 200 others).  
  
The takeaway here is the space is desperately in need of a new digital asset class and currency that is backed by something genuinely immutably valuable and stable: the AI aggregated value of user (big) data our platform stores on-chain, values and returns to users as a fungible currency and asset.  
  
**TECHNOLOGY**  
  
ProjectX is building a Web3 browser and chain agnostic custom chain, building on Cosmos IBC as this allows them to integrate their custom chain with all other chains to create the basis for a true IoB, ushering in Web3.  
  
The PRX blockchain in conjunction with Cosmos is implemented so multiple chains on the PRX chain can communicate with each other. The PRX blockchain is partly implemented using a Cosmos SDK. Cosmos SDK is a modular framework for building interoperable, application-specific blockchains.  
  
They are building specifically with Cosmos because it allows them to not only have several blockchains (one being for data storage others being for transfers etc) but have them seamlessly interact with each other.  
  
**PRODUCT DIVE**  
  
Customers primarily use ProjectX's Web3 browser, called Gleam, to access Web3, taking advantage of all the benefits Web3 offers, including communications, economic advantages etc.  
  
PRX Gleam is a ‘true’ (as defined by the Ethereum Foundation’s premise) Web3 browser and custom blockchain. Gleam gives mainstream user access to the Internet of Blockchains (IoB), securing user data on-chain for each user. Users convert their data into a fungible currency, PXR, via ProjectX's Defi layer for their commerce and business needs (including purchases, loans etc).  
  
By enabling mainstream users cross-chain access to the IoB, ProjectX ushers in Web3 in the same way Netscape ushered in the Web by giving mainstream user access to the original Internet. Users can opt in to contribute selected data to PRX’s exerithms, which, via Gleam, anonymize and ‘value’ this data. This valuation is determined by assigning values, both market and insight value, to all possible outputs derived from a specific input (similar to sCompute, Cirus) and expressing this as an economic value (PRX). In this way, the value of PRX remains stable as it is not prey to market variables and the asymmetric agendas of the speculators.  
  
For each individual user, their data value is expressed as a ‘personalized’ exchange rate, called EXR (‘PRX Rate’ or ‘Exchange Rate’), which is a number to four decimal places displayed on a user’s task bar. EXR is applied by Gleam users via DeFi features — PRX Pay, PRX Bank, etc — to make payments cheaper, get better interest rates on PRX Loans, etc: EXR is effectively a personalized exchange rate between all currencies.  
  
**REVENUE STREAMS**  
  
Revenue streams primarily come from the vertical business solutions the project builds on their horizontal platform, including their DEX and payment services. These include PRX commercial and individual loans repaid at a competitive aggregate rate of 2–4.5%, with PRX P2P services at 0.25%-1% fees, while competitive fees at 0.05%-0.25% accrued from trading on their DEX will be the first revenue stream to come online 4–6 months post raise. Further revenue streams include their decentralized ads feature, which is being developed by their CMO, a former Swash ads lead, and P2P loans, under the direction of their advisor, a former Harvard economics professor.  
  
**TOKEN UTILITIES**  
  
ProjectX's token is the sole gateway between their internal data economy and the mainstream economy, giving PXC unparalleled utility for purchases, payments and other DeFi and finance features only accessible on their platform. This utility will be in evidence at DEX launch 6 months post-raise as it is the only way to access reduced fees and other facilities to trade on their DEX, placing enormous buying pressure on the token due to pre- and post-launch marketing of this and other DeFi platform features.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,I found out about Quant here. What are your other moonshots that have a quality product and ideally a mainnet or a roadmap that is realistically going to be implemented and be useful?,"first thanks for for Quant, when i read about what it does and their partnership with SIA, i thought this had some legs. if it gets binance listing, which i think it should because of SIA partnership, it should moon even higher, there are plenty of posts in this sub talking about its benefits so have a read. its not too late despite cracking into the top 100 today in mcap.



im here to ask what your picks are for moonshots and why. maybe this could be a monthly thread?

I'm also going to give my pointers on how to pick good projects, its not exhaustive. just the basics without havng to spend 2 days reading a whitepaper

**What to look for in a quality project**

- does it solve a problem that needs to be solved and why? there is so much crap out there e.g. cannabis coins

- does this solution need a blockchain? - more on that below. blockchain has become a hammer where there is a nail, lots of money to be made from naive investors. you only need blockchain to remove a centralised authority if it has the potential to be a bad actor otherwise centralised software is the solution. BTC is the perfect example. the centralised actor is the mint. with btc we know how much btc is created and its 100% transparent. tether is the problem BTC solved. 

- what is the roadmap like? does it have a mainnet? is it being used?

- whats the team like, how is their progress? i like to check out who is on the team then head over to their github and check out the reports on the commits. warning signs are a ton of contributors but only 1-2 people contributing, or commits where they just do pointless refactors or add comments to bring the commit count up. one shitcoin i saw, its github was just an empty ERC20 contract with no implementation.

**does this solution need a blockchain?**

lets me honest, most blockchain projects are garbage / vapourware and in many circumstances are best served by a centralised solution over a decentralised one that blockchain provides. have a read of this paper I posted on /r/CryptoTechnology 
 https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/7yptse/do_you_need_a_blockchain_this_paper_is_fantastic/

the paper is a tad anti blockchain, but thats up to the reader to decide. but the short answer is, there isnt that many use cases for blockchain.

**Some coins posted here im skeptical about, posted in threads here**

Fantom and BANANO . DaGs with smart contracts. i havent looked into how rich these are. they could be basic smart contracts like in bitcoin or provide a turing complete language allowing dApps. i dont see how this can work in practice on a DaG though. the kicker for me and DaGs promising richer features like this is that they are operating on a feeless model which runs into problems with running a node, it boils down to wanting to support the network, as is the case with nano and iota (i dont want to start a war here, just my opinion). 

Also for Dags promising smart contracts. if it does run a Turing complete language it's resources have to be regulated to not bring down the network because Turing complete languages can run loops, an infinite loop can bog down the network. Etherum resolves this with Gas computation requires gas, money. So how does a feeless dag with dapps work? 

I realise BANNANO is a memecoin forked off nano code, but like doges fork of the code from LTC it looks like they are doing serious dev on it (correct me if im wrong) that its 2100 or so in mcap position, so throw 100$ and get the faucet coins.",26,2019-06-22 00:02:28,62
USDT,CryptoMoonShots,What do you thing of this new type of cryptocurrency called super-stablecoin?,"Hey there! So there is this new concept of cryptocurrency called super-stablecoin? It claims to offer more stability than popular cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum, while also avoiding value loss due to inflation, unlike Tether. It utilizes a concept called multi-asset-backing and a reserve fund to maintain stability and potentially even increase in value beyond inflation rates. It sounds like a really appealing idea!  
Cryptocurrencies have grown tremendously over the years, with Bitcoin leading the pack. However, their value can fluctuate wildly, causing concerns for stability. That's where the idea of a super-stablecoin becomes appealing but the inflation that erodes the value of normal stablecoins pegged to state issued currencies is also a big consern when leaving your money in a stablecoin like Tether which suffers the same inflation as US Dollar does.  
The concept of multi-asset backing means that the super-stablecoin is not solely tied to one type of asset like Tether. Instead, it is backed by a variety of different assets, which helps to reduce its volatility. This diversification can potentially make it a more stable investment option. Additionally, the presence of a reserve fund adds an extra layer of security and stability.  
But as with any new cryptocurrency, it's crucial to do your due diligence and carefully evaluate the claims being made. While the idea of a more stable cryptocurrency is certainly appealing, it's important to consider various factors such as the underlying technology, the team behind it, and the overall market conditions.

Now, I'm curious, have you heard about this super-stablecoin before? It's always exciting to discover new innovations in the cryptocurrency world. And of course, the big question is: do you think this concept is too good to be true? It's always important to approach new developments with a healthy dose of skepticism.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Million Token- created by techlead,"Million Token

Most of the information can be found in the YouTube video linked below. 

Techlead created a token with a unique feature being tethered to USDC at a 1MM= $1 USDC 
The difference is, unlike a normal tether; there is infinite upside and growth potential. 

There are exactly 1,000,000 Tokens and that’s the total supply. 

This token has the feel of a “social experiment” and already a strong backing since the creator “techlead “ invested $600k of his own into this token. 

At this point, the momentum seems to be in the hands of the community; will it be audited? 
Listed? 
Be promoted by other influencers in the crypto space? 
Find its way on mainstream media? 
Like any crypto, the future is unpredictable and volatile. 
DYOR but I have a good feeling about this one.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,CryptoPila | ERC-20 | multi-asset-backed stablecoin | Bounty Program | Points for equity | Scarcity-free | Community Building | Early Stage,"Stablecoins are great for stability but suffer erosion of value to inflation suffered by the currencies that back them up. On other hand crypto currencies bound to commodities like gold suffer from the volatility inherent to such commodities. CryptoPila is an idea that aims to solve both issues.   
WEBSITE: https://cryptopila.com  
**WHAT IS CryptoPila?**  
To be offered initially as an ERC20 token in Ethereum mainnet, CryptoPila is a novel multi-asset-backed stablecoin which aims to deliver similar stability as other stablecoins but without suffering form inflation.

  
**How it works**  
CryptoPila invests the funds received for the sale of the coins in a diversified portfolio that includes gold, S&P 500 index, USD and potentially other profit-generating assets. This diversification generates less risk and a more stable price. It achieves stability trough the following core concepts:  
\- **Guaranteed buyback price** \- It guarantees a minimum buyback price that aims to be consistently growing over time, making sure that the token price never falls below this floor value.  
\- **Scarcity-free approach** \- Tokens are minted on demand and prevent sharp rises on price due to scarcity, reinforcing the commitment to stability over short-term gains.

\- **Reserve fund** \- Part of the profits generated by the assets acquired are put aside in a reserve fund that is later used to support the buyback price even when the prices of the assets (gold, USD etc) that back the price are falling, this is fundamental to keep prices stable when market prices are fluctuating.

  
**Bounties - You can earn points to earn equity**  
I believe this is a potential moonshot on their points system, which is a copy of what Bitcoin did in the early days to attract enthusiasts and consists of giving rewards for people engaging on promoting Cryptopila with the difference that instead of giving the coin itself as reward, points are given that can later be exchanged by equity in the company that will be formed to manage the funds produced by the sales of the token. Points can be earn in many ways:  
\- Producing and sharing content.  
\- Referrals.  
\- Being an ambassador.  
\- Producing visual art.  
\- Buying and holding the token.  
And more. is like if tether did it back then you could have a share in a company that today have a multi billion market cap.  
I believe this is a great product and is the next obvious evolution of stablecoins with Libra already kind of leaning towards that but CryptoPila is the very early stages and therefore seems a great opportunity for who jumps into it now.

✅ Perfect entry for new comers and to recharge 
✅ 10% more holders everyday for last 9 days

We are now one of the projects with the smallest number of whales. Our top holder has 1.54% and the second has 0.51%. Top 5 wallets combined have only 3.51%. Check the whales of the other projects?? It’s crazy like 20% or more for top 5 wallets.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,A Unique Approach to Passive Income in the Crypto Landscape!!,"Cryptocurrency investments often revolve around profit, yet the market's volatility can be overwhelming, especially for newcomers. Navigating concepts like technical analysis and algorithmic prediction requires time and expertise, leading to more losses than gains.  
  
A solution lies in passive income strategies like masternodes, an often overlooked avenue. Unlike active trading, masternodes provide stability and earnings. They involve specialized nodes that facilitate faster transactions and require locking up tokens as collateral. This concept, popularized by Dash, has been adopted by various networks, such as Morpheus Network.

To set up a masternode, you require:  
  
A predetermined quantity of tokens for locking up (specified by the network).  
A wallet for token storage.  
Dedicated hardware.  
Consistent network uptime.  
My journey into masternodes began about a year ago. Initially, masternodes appeared akin to staking, with the added aspect of potential decision-making rights for masternode validators. However, the true advantage lies in the ability to generate passive income regardless of market fluctuations.  
  
One of my recent masternode ventures was with Morpheus.Network, a supply chain platform backed by Google's accelerator and endorsed by prominent enterprises since 2017. My investment strategy revolved around selecting fundamentally strong cryptocurrencies with competent teams. Morpheus.Network's program offered a remarkable 18% annual percentage rate (APR) for validators, nearly double that of other options. By acquiring 180,000 MNW tokens (traded on Kucoin and Uniswap) and establishing 100 nodes using my home PC, my total investment was $180,000. As the lock-up period concluded, I received approximately $32,400 in rewards, equivalent to 18% of my initial investment. The beauty of this approach is the ability to reinvest the rewards into new nodes post-lock-up.  
  
Notably, the option to restake tokens for subsequent node setup after the lock-up's conclusion enhances the earnings potential. My involvement extended beyond Morpheus.Network, as I also invested around $50,000 in DASH tokens, yielding approximately 7% APR. The fact that a substantial portion of total DASH coins is held by masternodes adds confidence to the project's solidity.  
  
The key takeaway is that for newcomers navigating the volatile crypto market, the option of passive income through masternodes offers an alternative route to mitigate risks while maintaining stability. Unlike speculative trading, masternodes assure a fixed APR, which contributes a steady element to your investment portfolio. Importantly, you're not tethered to screens, constantly analyzing charts; instead, your idle PC can be generating income. Nonetheless, exercise prudence and always conduct thorough research on projects before investing, as this information shouldn't replace personalized financial advice.",1,2023-08-09 12:21:46,2

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,CRV and Curve DAO: A Moonshot Worth Considering,"Hello, fellow crypto enthusiasts! If you've been paying attention to the DeFi landscape, you've likely heard a thing or two about Curve DAO (CRV). But if you haven't been keeping tabs, or if CRV is completely new to you, I'm here to tell you why it just might be the moonshot we've all been waiting for.  
Firstly, let's talk about Curve's latest innovation - the TriCrypto Pool. This is a game-changer, my friends. The pool hosts Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), and USD Tether (USDT) and offers double benefits for Ether holders. That's right, double. How, you ask? Traders provide liquidity first to the TriCrypto pool and then deposit the TriCrypto LP token in a different pool. This innovative approach is quite the disruption to the DeFi market and opens up opportunities to earn higher income from liquidity pools. Curve is clearly thinking outside the box here, and this is exactly the type of innovation that could catapult CRV to new heights.  
Now, let's talk tokens. Both CRV and Convex Finance (CVX) tokens have seen a rally following the launch of the TriCrypto pool. In fact, these assets have already yielded upwards of 5% gains for holders. While past performance is never a guarantee of future success, it's hard not to get excited about this positive momentum.  
But the innovation doesn't stop there. Curve recently deployed its native stablecoin, crvUSD, on the Ethereum mainnet. crvUSD is an overcollateralized stablecoin backed by crypto assets, setting it apart from the competition with a unique lending-liquidating algorithm known as LLAMA. This mechanism constantly rebalances users' collateral as crypto prices fluctuate, offering a smoother, continuous liquidation process that contrasts with the single, drastic events often causing turbulence in other protocols. Although crvUSD isn't accessible to the public just yet, I'm eagerly awaiting the impact this will have on Curve's ecosystem once it's integrated into the user interface.  
Let's not forget the numbers. At the time of writing, the current price of CRV is $0.85, with a market cap of $688.3M and a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $37.3M. While CRV has experienced a slight dip recently, it's important to remember that volatility is part and parcel of the crypto world, and it could well be the perfect time to buy low and wait for the inevitable climb.  
In conclusion, Curve DAO is not just an interesting project; it's a project that's pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the DeFi space. It's been making some big moves recently, and I, for one, am excited to see where it goes next. As always, remember to do your own research and stay informed. Here's to the next moonshot, fellow crypto explorers!",0,2023-05-26 20:12:16,1

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Reserve Rights Token,"Here's a US-based project to develop another stable-coin standard. This has been listed on Huobi just today. 

&#x200B;

Highlights of this project are the list of 36 investors who have backed this, that include Coinbase Ventures, Peter Thiel (Co-founder of Paypal), and a whole bunch of other venture capitalists.

&#x200B;

The team currently consists of 18 people and they are looking at hiring more. The Reserve Rights Token (RSR) will play a part in stabilising their stable-coin, The Reserve Token (RSV), which will be released later on. With all the issues with Tether recently, I think the crypto world needs a new alternative and this could become the new standard.

&#x200B;

The current price on Huobi is 45 sats or  0.00352 USD so if their aim is to develop a stable coin that is valued at $1 USD, there is a lot of potential growth there (depending on the role of RSR on stabilising RSV).

 You are searching for a token with a very low market cap? Check this sleeping giant.

💎 An Individual Retirement Account designed specifically for Decentralized Exchanges.

💎 dexIRA is the first token with multi-currency rewards, advanced buyback protocols and

💎 Tokenomics that promote long term hodling and wealth generation.

🚀 Rewards holders in BNB, BTC, ETH, LINK, DOT, DOGE, SAFEMOON, ADA, BUSD, SAFEMOON and MORE! 🎊

The platform is based on the synergy of two concepts: DEX (decentralized exchanges) and IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts). Borrowing from the long-term investment idea behind a traditional IRA, dexIRA investors can grow their holdings commission-free similar to tax-free IRA contributions. This allows members to increase their stake in the reward pool over time without sacrificing initial capital.

After a one-year holding period, investors can sell their $DEX holdings tax-free and penalty-free. However, similar to the age restrictions on a traditional IRA, if holders choose to sell early, they're penalized.

Investors are protected even when $DEX tokens are sold and the price drops because they are rewarded with two thirds of all fees collected. Similarly, the dexIRA contract includes enhanced token buyback protocols to spur growth and anti-whale measures to prevent large one-off sell orders.

**Key features of dexIRA**

✅ Get 20% rewards

✅ Auto-claimed Multi-Currency Reflections

✅ Friendly Wale Buyback & Burn

✅ Automatic Liquidity Pool

✅ Anti Whale Dumps

✅ Burned LP

✅ No Tax on Buy Orders

✅ No mint token

✅ Sell tax removed after 1yr hodling

✅ Funds Are Safu

**Whats so special? And why is it mooning?**

The strategy is simple: Incentivize new investment by waiving fees when purchasing dexIRA tokens. Support long-term growth by providing rewards and penalizing speculative short-term traders.

dexIRA was created to shift the mindset of investors and prove that cryptocurrencies can be stable, value-appreciating assets if the tokenomics support a long-term investment goal

Buy $DEX tokens without fees, use them to automatically collect and manage a diverse array of curated tokens in the following cryptocurrencies: BNB, BUSD, BTCB, ETH, DOGE, CAKE, XRP, LITE, LINK, DOT, ADA. SAFEMOON, ATOM, MATIC, TETHER, 1INCH, BUNNY.

As transaction volume grows, the team will also be doing constant buyback and burns of TDOGE.

Buy TDOGE, Stack USDT! HODL and Earn!

TDOGE is having its fair launch on the 4th of May at 8PM EST! 📈🔥

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,$FOX - The token powering ShapeShift's new platform. A functional token from a big name that Reddit hasn't discovered yet.,"I usually lurk for DD but I'm honestly shocked that this hasn't popped up here yet so here we go.

If you've been keeping up with Crypto for a long time you might remember the name ShapeShift from back in the day, they generated a buzz by essentially prototyping swapping, creating a platform that functionally is somewhat comparable to modern counterparts like Uniswap. Shapeshift also operates the largest Swiss CEX, is the parent company of KeepKey, and is backed by the large venture capital firms that operate within the crypto sector. The aforementioned have funded ShapeShift's transition into a platform that integrates various DEXs into a mobile and soon-to-be web platform, in a move to capitalize on DeFi and unburden themselves from KYC regulations.

In essence, ShapeShift and it's founder, Erik Voorhees, are both well-respected and trusted names in crypto and I seriously expect this to make waves when they begin marketing and rolling out this platform, which appears to be within the month.

So how is ShapeShift a moonshot?

Enter FOX, the token ShapeShift has minted as a reward/loyalty/utility token designed to benefit ShapeShift users and the ShapeShift ecosystem. Users that hold FOX in their ShapeShift wallet are rewarded with $10 worth of commission-free trade volume that refreshes on a rolling 30-day basis as long as you hold FOX in your platform wallet. In addition to this incentive, users that hold FOX also partake in ""Rainfalls"", giving them a chance to earn rewards every time a trade occurs on the platform in the form of free USDC, a stablecoin tethered to USD. Your chances of winning a rainfall payout increases relative to the amount of FOX you hold.

As of right now, FOX is $1.25 and it is ranked #3098 on Coinmarketcap. Yeah. #3098.

As for issuance and fully diluted market cap?  The vast majority of the supply is held by ShapeShift in cold storage. That being said, they have not disclosed plans informing what the distribution schedule will look like into the future other than their current commitments to keep up signup rewards/fox back rewards/rainfall rewards or other rewards allocated by the ShapeShift team. They have also stated that if/when they do decide to make any adjustments to the distribution schedule in any significantly material way they would publish that in a public format ahead of any major changes to how the supply is currently handled. I do believe that this should be factored in to any scrutiny regarding FOX's FDMC, as ShapeShift clearly intends to ensure they have enough of this token to continue offering FOX based incentives and programs throughout the platforms projected lifespan, if not with an extra few years tacked on for redundancy.

Literally nobody knows what the fuck this is yet. FOX is trading on Hoo with a microscopic 24 hour volume of $55,000 and Uniswap with a 24 hour volume of $200,000. Yeah, a combined 24 hour volume of UNDER $1,000,000. Yesterday wasn't very different, with FOX seeing about 650k on Uniswap by EOD. $1.45 for a coin that merits proactive hoarding a la whale or ShapeShift user for massive amounts of commission-free trade volume and free USDC, and an order book skinnier than Christian Bale in the machinist?

It literally can't go tits up. (I am not a financial advisor)

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,$GRO - New DeFi platform DAO with lowvsupply begging for a squeeze + vesting that gives diamond hands any forfeited rewards that were unvested when paper hands leave,"For the past few months,  my strategy for finding new investments has basically been scanning messari and VC sites to see what the big guys like coinbase ventures, Framework,  robot, etc are buying and then looking into the actual product. Some problems were the platform either didn't have plans for native tokens, wasn't launched yet(not a bad thing actually, just not helpful at the time), or the price of the coin would seemingly plummet a few days after the funding was publicly announced (likely dumping from the VCs themselves). But the main issue, other than VCs getting in for pennies on the dollar, is that there's no innovation. Every DeFi platform was the same yearn knockoff or some random liquidity pool with a DAO token so the team can make their money. 

I have came across a few good ones in the past few weeks to my surprise. I think the money grabs have just already got their cut so now there's not as much shit to sift through, whatever. But one in particular really got the juices flowing. I'm rarely super bullish on any one project, and I'm definitely no guru that picks moon missions with Supreme accuracy, but posting this to get some feedback and maybe spread the word in case this does moon bc it's still new (launched 3 weeks ago)

The platform itself is called Gro Protocol (gro.xyz) The native token/DAO is $GRO. If you look at the site, the yields for LP are insanely high but this is not long term...it's a boost that will decrease around Nov 1st to more sustainable levels.

 BUT the rewards don't even matter for price... the circulating supply is less than 4m out of 100m max. That's because the initial supply was only 3.4m and all of the rewards on the platform are vested. Once someone claims their rewards, 10% is prevested and the rest vests linearly over the next year. The cool part is that if someone leaves right after they claim the rewards, the other 90% is distributed to those who stay vested, not back to the team.  So any diamond hands that join agmi. The VCs and Team are on a vesting schedule too but theirs is for 3 years with a 1 year cliff. So this supply is going to remain insanely low, and since it's only been launched for 3 weeks, there could be a massive squeeze as word travels. 

Aside from the vesting, there are some other key features that make it unique. After 3 weeks, the TVL + PCV is already $180m. The PCV accounts for $64m from 2 other native assets,  $GVT(VAULT) and $PWRD(PWRD Savings). These are sister assets that work together through a risk tranching mechanism and create a profit sharing strategy ultimately resulting in a big opportunity. HNWI and institutions are flocking to crypto and DeFi specifically for the high yields they can't get from a bank. But with regulations and a lot of concerns over stable coins, tether specifically, the risks are too high for institutions to truly put their faith in DeFi. PWRD is the answer, because on top of diversifying among pegs, the strategy also offers protection from a stable losing it's peg or a hack. That is because the sister asset, Vault, absorbs those lost funds. In exchange for taking any, even low probability, risks,  Vault is rewarded with higher yields. These include a HODL contribution also, so everybody will benefit... the institutions get protection with way higher yields than a bank, and us smaller investors get higher yields plus a cut from when they pull some funds out. 

This is a pretty shallow summary but hits on most of the key aspects:

TLDR
Super low GRO supply = price discovery squeeze, rewards vested for 1 year but 10% prevest and linear release meaning people can pull out whenever but the unvested amount distributed to those who stay vested, one of a kind PWRD Savings is institutions wet dream, high yields from profit sharing mechanism responsible for PWRDs security and protection, only launched 3 weeks ago and already $180m TVL + PCV, $7m+ invested from most prolific crypto VCs but they and the team are vested for 3 years

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,KAVA. Estimated gains: 10-40x by Q4 2020.,"I've seen two attempts in here that were rather bad. This is what you need to know:

Kava is a defi lending platform like Maker, where people can escrow their crypto and borrow against it. This is called a CDP (collateral debt position).

MKR is limited to ETH and ERC-20 tokens. This makes KAVA the first to market with CDP's for crypto's like BTC, XRP, BNB, LINK and ATOM. These will be added 100% and stakers can vote on more additions later. 

You know the XRParmy and LINKmarines are not selling and will double down with a CDP like ETH hodlers did.

After ~1 year, MKR has around 400million locked in CDP's and has a marketcap of ~500million. KAVA's marketcap today is ~12 million and the potential marketcap is arguably the same (if not higher than) MKR. 

This will give you an opportunity for a 40x on a 1 year timeframe.

I've seen some scepticism on circulating supply and total supply (this is the reason it's not already too late to buy imo). Let me address this:

Circulating supply is 13.6 million and total supply is 100 million (wtf i hear you say). The inflation of KAVA will go directly to the stakers (it's currently at 7%, with the max at 20%). As long as you are staking, you have no inflation. Besides that, Fees on loans will be paid with KAVA and the fee's will be burned.

Staking fee's are normally 10% of the earnings, but Binance is going to offer feeless staking very soon (like they did with XTZ. They are already running a KAVA validator as we speak). If you can't wait a year, you could also play the ""Binance free staking pump"", when it inevitably happens.

I could tell you how great the team is, (CEO is a founder of FNATIC, which is very successful in the gaming industry. He is not a coding expert, and that is why the project runs on the Cosmos SDK. There are some influential backers like Xpring from Ripple (haters gonna hate) and Binance (haters gonna hate) is obviously going to jumpstart adoption, by accepting the new stablecoin (USDX) users borrow to spend in the Binance casino.

If you haven't bought by now, i can't help you.

Edit: 

A little addition. Some people calling this a ''premined shitcoin'' really don't understand what is up here. This is a governance token which gives you part ownership of the DEFI platform. Besides that there's added utility with fees being paid in KAVA (which the users dont have to see or be bothered with). 100% of the tokens are allocated to investors,KAVA Labs and retail that bought through the Binance launchpad. Calling this a premined shitcoin is like calling AAPL stock a premined shitcoin. I'd almost think I'd be better off posting this stuff on 4chan..",10,2019-12-10 04:44:27,24

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,e-Money $NGM - Why is nobody talking about this?,"Hi all

I wanted to start up a discussion around a small cap that launched just under a month ago on the Polkastarter platform - 'e-Money'.

To summarise e-Money:

\- Stable coin that offers a variety of global currencies (not just USD)

\- First and only 'interest bearing' stable coin

\- \~7m tokens circulating, with 100m total supply.

\- Current Market Cap = \~$5m

e-Money is an electronic payment system developed upon the Cosmos blockchain, making it interoperable with other ecosystems. e-Money itself offers a wide variety of currency-backed stablecoins, they are the first provider of 'non-USD stablecoins' and upon launch, will be providing options for Euro, GBP, CHF, SEF, NOK and DKK currencies, with JPY and USD to follow in time. e-Money will suppport all major global currencies. This in itself makes me incredibly bullish on the project. Bitmax have already announced that they have partnered with e-Money and will offer e-Money pairs on their exchange. But this is not all...

Whilst the non-USD stablecoins are a fanstastic step forward, the thing that makes me most bullish overall is the fact that e-Money is the first provider of interest bearing stablecoins. That's right, you earn yield on your stablecoins as standard. Think about all the people buying 50k Swissborg tokens to get 20% APY on their stable coins.... now people have a stablecoin that pays interest itself. Incredibly disruptive tech.

Of course stable coins are great, but not much opportunity for asset appreciation! This is where $NGM comes in. $NGM is the secondary token within the e-Money system, and is the e-Money staking token that supports the value and collatoralisation of e-Money (along with a basket of other currencies). e-Money is a PoS blockchain and has around 40 active validators currently on the network (\~16% APY for staking). The price of NGM is directly correlated to the demand for the e-Money stable coins. More demand for e-Money stable coins = higher price of NGM.

As mentioned above, this was a Polkastarter IDO, but because it launched straight to Bitmax and not Uniswap, there was no outrageous 30x pump on day 1. POLS price was $0.5, current price is $0.73. Great accumulation range whilst we await Uniswap and T1 Exchange.

Before the end of Q1, the team will deploy their Ethereum bridge. Which means NGM will be trading on Uniswap. There is also a large tier 1 exchange lined up for Q1 and it looks as though it will be Huobi (although this isn't confirmed). Make of this as you will. Will a project like this still be at \~$5m Market Cap after Uniswap and T1 listing? I think not.

Regulatory concerns are also dealt with to some extent. e-Money’s team has already begun working with regulatory agencies in the EU to determine their status and plan their road ahead. They have legal counsels and advisors who are directly working on EU financial regulations. With all the Tether FUD knocking around, how can you not be bullish on a regulated, audited, currency-backed stable coin that offers multiple global currencies as well as being interest bearing?

Team and partners are totally legit, check it out: [https://www.e-money.com/](https://www.e-money.com/)

Interesting interview with Boxmining: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWE3oSxav38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWE3oSxav38)

Thank me later guys, look forward to hearing your thoughts on this

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,SurgeUseless Launching October 2nd 3PM EST!!!,"On October 2, 2021, the newest addition to the XSurge Ecosystem will launch. **We are Surging Useless Token!!!**  

***Quick Useless Overview***

* *Useless is a Tokenomics integrated token with many complex price boosting contracts tethered to it. Tax is allocated from every purchase to provide reflections and increase burn which appreciate the value of the token through supply and demand. In addition, they utilize two mechanisms in their business model that provide liquidity stability and strong gain potential. All external revenue made from their technological innovations go directly through a buyback and burn to generate volume. Their furnace contract, automatically stabilizes and boosts liquidity by buying new BNB from surplus tokens stored in the contract. This makes the token an extremely stable, and high gain potential backing asset for us.*

&#x200B;

The benefits that will come with Surging Useless as our first Tokenomics token is a massive leap towards our potential. With this integration, we will be boosting Useless positive price action as well as compounding our own value through complex mechanics not present in the previous Surge variants. The Useless Token team are a highly beneficial collaborative project that can further market our product as we market theirs. Similar to our collaboration with SafeVault, we are now working together from both a technical and professional standpoint adding more volume to both projects.  

Our ecosystems will work together generating their own catalysts for volume and revenue. Our backing asset will be the Useless Token, so as the pool grows, so too will its reflections thereby increasing the tokens value for SurgeUseless Holders! It will literally generate its own volume! Just to give you an idea of how big this pool can get, our SurgeETH variant currently holds 373 Ethereum or $1.2mm in it's contract. As our contract gains volume the ratio shifts in favor of the backing asset, so the backing asset constantly grows further increasing the token value.

With this variant, we have also incorporated a native staking option for Useless Token Holders through the XSURGE Ecosystem. Useless Holders will be able to stake their Useless for SUseless! Staking will be extremely beneficial for Useless holders. 

**With Staking:** No extra BNB will be needed for buying in! No need to sell your useless and face the 8% taxation just to rebuy the Surge Variant! It's cheaper than buying the Surge Version directly with BNB which imposes an 8% tax!  Our launch date is set for October 2, 2021. 

Here is the technical breakdown for how this token will work. Taxation is slightly different. We are completely tax exempt on the Useless side with the exception of the Furnace tax allocation. SUseless buys and sells will be exempt from standard Useless Taxation  

* ***8% Purchase and Sell*** *– For Buys and Sells, there will be a 6% Surge Tax, 0.5% will allocate to the SurgeFund, and 1.5% will go to the Useless Furnace Contract.* 
* ***6% Stake*** *– For Staking from Useless, there will be a 5.875% Surge Tax and 0.125% will allocate to the  SurgeFund.* 
* ***4% Transfer*** *- 1% will allocate to the SurgeFund, 3% Surge Tax (Burned from the Total Supply) for wallet-to-wallet transfers.* 

&#x200B;

**How Surge Tokens Work**

Our price is determined by a two factors: 

1. Volitility of the Backing Asset in the Contract 
2. XSurge Price Value Equation: backingAsset\_in\_contract / tokenTotalSupply  

**ON A BUY:** There is a set tax (8%) for both buys and sells. When you are taxed on a buy, new tokens are minted into the total supply. So the Total Supply of Tokens increases and you receive: 

***SUSLS - (SUSLS \* .08)*** 

100% of the BNB that you buy with is swapped for the value equivalent of Useless Token, and routes to the pool. So in this scenario, if the Asset (Useless) and Surge quantities were both equal before this transaction, the ratio would then shift in favor of the backing asset, triggering an increase in the price value of the token.  

**ON A SELL:** When tokens are sold back to the contract, the seller pays a set tax (8%) on the asset they receive. 100% of the tokens sold are then destroyed and completely removed from the total supply. As a result, the Total Supply of Surge decreases, and the seller receives: 

***Useless - (Useless \* .06)*** 

&#x200B;

As previously stated the Launch Date is set for October 2, 2021 3PM EST. We are a completely fair launch organization. There is no whitlisting or PreSales. At the time and date specified the contract will go live, our bot will automatically post the announcement and contract number across all media outlets, and people can purchase. I'll post the links below for anyone that wants to do more research as well as the tutorials for how to buy.

You are searching for a token with a very low market cap? Check this sleeping giant.

💎 An Individual Retirement Account designed specifically for Decentralized Exchanges.

💎 dexIRA is the first token with multi-currency rewards, advanced buyback protocols and

💎 Tokenomics that promote long term hodling and wealth generation.

🚀 Rewards holders in BNB, BTC, ETH, LINK, DOT, DOGE, SAFEMOON, ADA, BUSD, SAFEMOON and MORE! 🎊

The   platform is based on the synergy of two concepts: DEX (decentralized   exchanges) and IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts). Borrowing from the   long-term investment idea behind a traditional IRA, dexIRA investors   can grow their holdings commission-free similar to tax-free IRA   contributions. This allows members to increase their stake in the reward   pool over time without sacrificing initial capital.

After   a one-year holding period, investors can sell their $DEX holdings   tax-free and penalty-free. However, similar to the age restrictions on a   traditional IRA, if holders choose to sell early, they're penalized.

Investors   are protected even when $DEX tokens are sold and the price drops   because they are rewarded with two thirds of all fees collected.   Similarly, the dexIRA contract includes enhanced token buyback protocols   to spur growth and anti-whale measures to prevent large one-off sell   orders.

**Key features of dexIRA**

✅ Get 20% rewards

✅ Automatic Liquidity Pool

✅ No rebase token

✅ Burned LP

✅ Auto-claimed Multi-Currency Reflections

✅ Friendly Wale Buyback & Burn

✅ Anti Whale Dumps

✅ No Tax on Buy Orders

✅ No mint token

✅ Sell tax removed after 1yr hodling

✅ Funds Are Safu

**Whats so special? And why is it mooning?**

The strategy is simple: Incentivize new investment by waiving fees when   purchasing dexIRA tokens. Support long-term growth by providing rewards   and penalizing speculative short-term traders.

dexIRA   was created to shift the mindset of investors and prove that   cryptocurrencies can be stable, value-appreciating assets if the   tokenomics support a long-term investment goal

Buy  $DEX tokens without fees, use them to automatically collect and manage  a  diverse array of curated tokens in the following cryptocurrencies:  BNB,  BUSD, BTCB, ETH, DOGE, CAKE, XRP, LITE, LINK, DOT, ADA. SAFEMOON,  ATOM,  MATIC, TETHER, 1INCH, BUNNY.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Floshin 🚀 $4.1m MCap | Debit Card | DEX | Escrow | Stable Coin | Governance Platform | Whole set of DApps | CMC and CG coming soon 🚀,"**FLOSHIN** Token is designed for investors looking to make their cryptocurrency work just like any other form of capital, such that they can ensure a return on investment in any market. FLOSHIN is dedicated to providing a complete set of decentralized applications which increase profitability, safeguard security and extend to real-life use cases like fiat currency. We believe that to be competitive, we need first to cover the most popular decentralised applications and at the same time be ambitious for the new ideas.

Following Decentralised Applications will help us in taking cryptocurrency in real-life use cases like fiat currency:  
‍

1. Automated market-making(AMM) decentralised exchange(DEX) with adverse farm and built-in Cross-Chain routers.
2. NFT Marketplace - we already have a list of 200+ artists, and over 10k+digital arts which will be listed on our marketplace website immediately after the launch.
3. Floshin Stable Coin, which will be pegged to the US dollar.
4. Interactive Crypto Wallet.
5. We will be partnering with a debit card issuer and issuing Floshin Debit Card  
‍\*(Floshin holders can apply for the debit card subject to KYC checks)\*.  
‍6. Our Escrow Contract will replace the middle man, which will be used in our marketplace similar to Amazon and Shopify. Both buyers and sellers will be able to use our Escrow contract to trade. The physical goods protection in transit will be covered by the third-party insurance purchased by the buyer while initiating their trade.
6. Governance platform for any DeFi token.

**Tokenomics**

✔️ 3% to holders in BUSD  
✔️ 3% add in liquidity pool  
✔️ 2% for marketing and development

**Unique Selling Point**  
FLOSHIN Token is developing a powerful community by offering debit card solutions. Our stable coin will be capable of being traded between sellers and buyers with sustainable commission which will be cheaper than Tether and DAI. Tether has a 0.5% commission + an exchange fee. Whereas FLOSHIN Stable Coin will have 0.05% commission + an exchange fee.  
‍  
Our wallet will operate in a similar process as PayPal and Stripe by allowing merchants to register an account that can be used to perform transactions with our stable coin in a safe and anonymous background.  
‍  
With the crypto merchant account and our Escrow contracts when used together will provide buyers and sellers security and transparency with the cheapest transaction cost possible in the current market.

https://phantasma.io/home

https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/phantasma

Unlike RARI, 100% is already minted with only 3% inflation per year for development funding.

47% of supply are currently staked by HODLERs at 18% APY, meaning only 53% supply is in circulation.

It's blockchain agnostic so it works accross multiple block chains. NEP5 interoperability already here, with ERC-20 coming this month.

It's way faster and more efficient than ERC20. They've also got decentralized storage and email dApps in the works.

This shit is like Eth, RARI, Sia, Enjin combined and it's only 7M market cap rn.

They will be on one of the main stages in PAX 10 days from now. Word is they've already got partnerships with SteelSeries and AMD.

I've literally liquidated all my altcoins into Tether in preparation of the coming stonks dump EXCEPT for my SOUL bag. That's how bullish I am on this.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,MTRG - Meter Governance token for Meter Stablecoin,"The Meter Network launched its Governance token IEO in lottery style on Gate.io at $0.5.

USD Tether, no 3 in global marketshare, owns a huge 90% of all stable coins totalling 10 billion in marketcap! Like every other stablecoin out there, it is vastly centralized and the cause for much worry and doubt (esp between warring governments and institutions).

Dai, a decentralized alternative on the other hand, eats into a multimilliondollar share, but its PoS nature is also a huge cause for worry.

Now the Meter team, a distinguished team of high laurels, created the Meter token (MTR) which is a unique Proof of Work blockchain where every Meter metered out (pun intended ;) is worth & pegged to 10KW of power ensuring the stablecoin has a consistent value of $1.

The Meter (MTR) blockchain is a stablecoin asset faster than Bitcoin and Ethereum, although the team is working on an exclusive MTRG-erc20 & MTR-erc20 bridge so MTR can be intergrated into ETH defi, and similar users and holders can have the added convienence to store MTR or MTRG in their popular erc20 wallets. More of these bridges by the team will allow for MTR PoW stablecoin to be intergated into other top blockchains like TRON, TOMO, Cardano, Wanchain and more!

(NOTE: The Meter blockchain is 100x faster than Ethereum.)

The Stablecoin market is rising fast and many in traditional finance (like JP Morgan) believe it will rival/surpass Bitcoin in marketcap and we all know Bitcoin is just getting warmed up.

It is truly unique and decentralized in its proposition, tokenomics and operations, so i won't be surprised to see more listings on cremé de la cremé exchanges very soon.

it may very well dethrone USDT, which no other stablecoin asset (centralized or otherwise) has been able to do.

Meter is backed by heavyweights, the likes of Pantera, with ecosystem partners like chainlink, and was listed on Coinmarketcap today. 

MTRG's present 2.1mil marketcap is peanuts when considering this governs a stablecoin asset with all the right partnerships & a 40 mil max supply released over the next...wait for it...400 years!!!

This is only the beginning of its ascent and popularity as the only PoW secure network surpassing bitcoin in speed and decentralization, and ofcourse Stability.

Suicide Stack : 350 mtrg

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Why Is It Beneficial to Attend Large Blockchain Events?,"If you keep an occasional eye on blockchain news, then you are aware that it is much more than just a growing trend. In fact, it’s become quite clear that Blockchain is here to stay, and will make an even bigger impact on the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market. Its transformation on society as a whole is becoming a real hot topic, and Blockchain’s influence on the economic world is currently unparalleled. So, if you deal with Blockchain and multiple cryptocurrencies, this influential spike in the industry is more than a good reason to begin to look into visiting a few of the large Blockchain events.

Here is how everyone can benefit from paying a visit to blockchain events:

**1. Learn from appealing speakers**

Perhaps the biggest draw for large Blockchain events is the lineup of speakers. After all, if you’re going to take time out of your busy schedule to attend, you’ll want to be sure that you are listening to well-educated influencers in the field, who can offer real-world advice.

**2. Discover New Tokens and new technology from vendors**

The exhibitors are also a huge plus when attending a large Blockchain event, as you never know which product or a new piece of technology might be just what you’re looking for to move your business to the next level. Additionally, you may find that you can collaborate with a vendor, which can be mutually beneficial for both parties. You never know where you might find a surprising new opportunity!

**3. Network with others attending the event**

Throughout the day, the chances are good that you’re going to meet quite a few like-minded individuals. After all, that’s why you’re all at the same event! Take this opportunity to network away. Whether you find that you can join forces with another attendee for a project, or you just file a name and affiliation for later use, a contact is a contact, and you never know when you might need one.

**4. Eventually become a guest speaker**

You may already be well-educated in the Blockchain industry, or perhaps you’re just beginning to learn of its many financial benefits. Whichever the case, you may thoroughly enjoy the idea of moving into the spotlight and becoming a guest speaker. The tables may turn after some time and with immense knowledge, you could turn out to be a speaker.

If I have sparked some curiosity in you to attend a large crypto event that is happening soon, then you are lucky as there is one you should not miss for anything. The North American Bitcoin Conference, join hundreds of the most influential speakers as they deliver compact crypto masterclasses. It will take place from January 17th to 19th. Dive into conversations and discuss the state of cryptocurrency with industry pioneers and innovators.

Keynote programming is focused on real-time topics and trends and offers attendees honest perspectives and strategies to impact their future with cryptocurrency. Listen as the most brilliant minds teach us about global adoption of blockchain technology, institutional investment (inc. Grayscale, MicroStrategy, ETFs, NFTs), geopolitical threats, and the newest opportunities in blockchain (inc. regulatory sandboxes, restrictions). Discuss decentralized finance (inc. DeFi, “Ethereum killers”, yield farming), central bank digital currencies (inc. Stablecoins, Tether), and much much more.",21,2021-11-30 21:05:06,3

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Ample Gold (AMPLG) - The first Defi Gold pegged Elastic Supply token," \>$260,000 Market Cap  
\>Target Price is pegged to 0.01g of Gold (currently $0.63)  
\>Random rebasing between a period of every 12-36 hours  
\>Project just went through a soft relaunch with a very active and engaged team  
Ample Gold ($AMPLG) is a supply-elastic, non-dilutive collateral asset that adjusts supply based on gold- equal to 0.01 gram of gold. The gold index used is PAX Gold (PAXG) a digital asset created by Paxos which is where 1 PAXG token is backed by 1 troy ounce (31.1035g) of a 400 oz London Good Delivery gold bar. The DeFi space needs a collateral utility that can be used as a store of value and a hedge against periods of high inflation in the global economy.  


Why The Gold Standard?

The gold standard is a monetary system where a country's currency or paper money has a value directly linked to gold. With the gold standard, countries agreed to convert paper money into a fixed amount of gold. A country that uses the gold standard sets a fixed price for gold and buys and sells gold at that price. That fixed price is used to determine the value of the currency. For example, if the U.S. sets the price of gold at $500 an ounce, the value of the dollar would be 1/500th of an ounce of gold.

The gold standard is not currently used by any government. This has allowed the wealthy to benefit from inflation and monetary crises due to trickle-down economics.

Elastic and Non-Dilutive

""AMPLG combines the best of Bitcoin and stablecoins, and tethers it to gold. It is an inflation hedged, decentralized primitive.""

AMPLG's smart contract design allows the automatic increase and decrease of supply based on market conditions. This means that the number of AMPLG tokens you own fluctuates, thus confirming the elastic property. The supply adjustment operation happens universally across all AMPLG token holders. So while the number of tokens have changed, the value stored is not diluted. This supply adjustment operation is called a rebase and creates a fairer monetary system.

Randomly Rebasing Algorithm

A fixed time or interval-based rebasing will introduce predictability into the supply adjustment. To avoid such predictability and potential price manipulation and exploitation,  Ample Gold implements a random mechanism that adjusts its supply at a random time from 12-36 hours after the last rebase. This will converge to an average of 365 rebase events per year.

Our ultimate goal is to serve as a hedge to inflation of the US dollar

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,$XHV Haven Protocol," For hundreds of years countless, sometimes global players have tried to ""peg"" something in value against something else. World history is littered with spectacular failures in this regard. Many different things have been tried, by very bright people, to no avail: No such peg has stood the test of time. None. Some have worked for a long time, like the USD versus gold peg, but in the end that blew up as well.  


And now a young Monero fork with a small team and a small valuation comes along and wants to make me believe that they solved this, in a way: a cryptocurrency organized such that it's able to ""store"" fiat while conserving value.  


Imagine a world where something like that would be possible. Earth's monetary history, sharply divided into two periods ""before Haven Protocol"" and ""after Haven Protocol

Why tether when you can print $Cake directly into your wallet by holding $CakePrinter?

Play prediction! Enter the lottery! Stake your tokens in the auto-compounding pool! The options are almost endless with the $cake that will be printed directly into your wallet.

But, community is everything in crypto, which is why we have decided to take a different approach with this token in order to get the community more involved and make sure we have diamond hand holders!

Without dedicated holders, it is impossible for us to effectively market the token. If the token dumps instantly, it becomes very difficult for us to convince more people to invest.

For this reason, the token will get more and more legit as we reach different market caps (and you earn a bunch of cake). And rest assured, if our community bands together and holds, we can take this to the moon.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,"💎 dexIRA ($DEX) 🚀 2nd pump is coming soon 🚀 Get 20% Rewards every hour 🚀 Rewards in BNB, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Link, Polkadot, Doge, Safemoon, Cardano & more! 🎊 Just listed on CoinMarketCap & CoinGecko ✖️ Don't miss this sleeping giant!","**What Is dexIRA (DEX)?**

Hello  guys! Searching for a legit token? You want to retire early? I want it too, thats the reason, why I  invested in dexIRA. But whats dexIRA? dexIRA provides fully  automated  multi-currency dividend rewards, advanced  buyback protocols  and  tokenomics that promote long term holding and  wealth generation.

Check the Telegram Channel & Website:

🌐 Website: [https://dexIRA.com/](https://dexira.com/)

💬 Telegram: [https://t.me/dexIRA](https://t.me/dexIRA)

You are searching for a token with a very low market cap? Check this sleeping giant.

💎 An Individual Retirement Account designed specifically for Decentralized Exchanges.

💎 dexIRA is the first token with multi-currency rewards, advanced buyback protocols and

💎 Tokenomics that promote long term hodling and wealth generation.

🚀 Rewards holders in BNB, BTC, ETH, LINK, DOT, DOGE, SAFEMOON, ADA, BUSD, SAFEMOON and MORE! 🎊

The platform is based on the synergy of two concepts: DEX (decentralized exchanges) and IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts). Borrowing from  the   long-term investment idea behind a traditional IRA, dexIRA  investors   can grow their holdings commission-free similar to tax-free IRA contributions. This allows members to increase their stake in the reward pool over time without sacrificing initial capital.

After a one-year holding period, investors can sell their $DEX holdings tax-free and penalty-free. However, similar to the age restrictions on a traditional IRA, if holders choose to sell early, they're penalized.

Investors are protected even when $DEX tokens are sold and the price drops    because they are rewarded with two thirds of all fees collected.    Similarly, the dexIRA contract includes enhanced token buyback protocols    to spur growth and anti-whale measures to prevent large one-off sell    orders.

**Key features of dexIRA**

✅ Get 20% rewards

✅ Automatic Liquidity Pool

✅ No rebase token

✅ Burned LP

✅ Auto-claimed Multi-Currency Reflections

✅ Friendly Wale Buyback & Burn

✅ Anti Whale Dumps

✅ No Tax on Buy Orders

✅ No mint token

✅ Sell tax removed after 1yr hodling

✅ Funds Are Safu

**Whats so special? And why is it mooning?**

The  strategy is simple: Incentivize new investment by waiving fees when    purchasing dexIRA tokens. Support long-term growth by providing rewards and penalizing speculative short-term traders.

dexIRA    was created to shift the mindset of investors and prove that cryptocurrencies can be stable, value-appreciating assets if the  tokenomics support a long-term investment goal

Buy   $DEX tokens without fees, use them to automatically collect and manage   a  diverse array of curated tokens in the following cryptocurrencies:   BNB,  BUSD, BTCB, ETH, DOGE, CAKE, XRP, LITE, LINK, DOT, ADA. SAFEMOON,  ATOM,  MATIC, TETHER, 1INCH, BUNNY.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,MTRG - 900K mcap - Partners with Matic for the future of DeFi,"Meter Network just amnounced their partnership with Matic Network to capitalize on the budding Stablecoin industry on these emerging networks!

Read more here: https://www.meter.io/meter-matic-partnership/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=metermaticpartnership

In case you missed it, the Meter Network launched its Governance token IEO in lottery style on Gate.io at $0.5. It's back to $0.5 on the markets now from its ATH after launch at $2.78. Excellent entry price for this groundbreaker project backed by heavyweights the likes of Pantera Capital, DHVC &  ecosystem partners like chainlink and more!

We all know USD Tether, no 3 in global marketshare, owns a huge 90% of all stable coins totalling 10 billion in marketcap! Like every other stablecoin out there, it is vastly centralized and the cause for much worry and doubt (esp between warring governments and institutions).

Dai, a decentralized alternative on the other hand, eats into a multimilliondollar share, but its PoS nature is also a huge cause for worry.

Now the Meter team, a distinguished team of high laurels, created the Meter token (MTR) which is a unique Proof of Work blockchain where every Meter metered out (pun intended ;) is worth & pegged to 10KW of power ensuring the stablecoin has a consistent value and with more miners and a vast network this is better stable model than fiat currencies..

The Meter (MTR) blockchain is a stablecoin asset faster than Bitcoin and Ethereum, although the team has completed an exclusive MTRG-erc20 & MTR-erc20 bridge so MTR can be intergrated into ETH defi, and similar users and holders can have the added convienence to store MTR or MTRG in their popular erc20 wallets. More of these bridges by the team will allow for MTR PoW stablecoin to be intergated into other top blockchains like Matic, Elrond and more!

(NOTE: The Meter blockchain is 100x faster than Ethereum.)

The Stablecoin market is rising fast and many in traditional finance (like JP Morgan) believe it will rival/surpass Bitcoin in marketcap and we all know Bitcoin is just getting warmed up.

It is truly unique and decentralized in its proposition, tokenomics and operations, so i won't be surprised to see more listings on cremé de la cremé exchanges very soon.

it may very well dethrone USDT, which no other stablecoin asset (centralized or otherwise) has been able to do.

MTRG's present 2.3mil marketcap is peanuts when considering this governs a stablecoin asset with all the right partnerships & a 40 mil max supply released over the next...wait for it...200 years!!!

This is early days of its ascent and popularity as the only PoW secure network surpassing bitcoin in speed and decentralization, and ofcourse Stability.

Suicide Stack : 350 mtrg

The Meter Governance token, both $MTRG and metastable (i.e.stable in relation to all currency) $MTR is available on Gate.io

And these pairs are also available at MXC, and Hoo.com!

Earn $Doge as you HODL (8% reflection)

Why tether when you can get $Doge rewards directly into your wallet by holding $DividendDoge?

Community is everything in crypto, which is why we have decided to take a different approach with this token in order to get the community more involved and make sure we have diamond hand holders! 

Without dedicated holders, it is impossible for us to effectively market the token. If the token dumps instantly, it becomes very difficult for us to convince more people to invest.

For this reason, the token will get more and more legit as we reach different market caps (and you earn a bunch of DOGE). And rest assured, if our community bands together and holds, we can take this to the moon.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,How To Avoid rug pulls by only choosing projects which use a liquidity locker like CryptEx!," Without traditional forms of regulation in the DeFi space, users have to develop a certain degree of trust with the platforms they’re willing to lend their assets to or buy tokens from. Unfortunately, that trust is often breached in the form of rug pulls.

Rug pulls are a new type of exit scam where DeFi developers create a new token, pair it to a leading cryptocurrency such as tether or ether and set up a liquidity pool. 

They then market the newly created token and encourage people to deposit into the pool, often promising extremely high yields. Once the pool has a substantial amount of the leading cryptocurrency in it, the DeFi developers then use back doors intentionally coded into the token’s smart contract to mint millions of new coins that they use to sell for the popular cryptocurrency. This completely drains the popular cryptocurrency from the pool and leaves millions of worthless coins in it. The founders then disappear without a trace.

A famed “billion-dollar rug pull” came in 2020, when SushiSwap developer Chef Nomi unexpectedly liquidated his SUSHI tokens after raising over a billion dollars in collateral. The price of the Uniswap competitor’s token fell to near zero in what is remembered as one of “the most dramatic moments in DeFi.”

Avoid rug pulls by confirming that Project's team tokens and LP tokens are locked with a locker such as CryptExLocker !",3,2021-07-19 11:25:14,1
USDT,CryptoMoonShots,"I dont advise anyone to invest in memecoins, based on risk. That being said, if youre here because you plan to buy into one anyway, SAFEMARS has proven to me it actually is the most secure for investors looking to turn a profit","As I mentioned in the cryptocurrency sub earlier, i threw down on a bunch of meme/shitcoins being shilled on this sub, and others around reddit about 2 weeks ago, as an experiment to both prove myself right that they were all scams, rug pulls, or that the pyramid would inevitably always fall like a house of cards, making it impossible for investors to ever see a return.  

i also hope to pull together enough information to determine if theyre ever profitable, signs that would indicate its a good tine to buy in, cash out, etc. 

while i dont have any of that compiled yet, the risk factor rings true so far for nearly every shitcoin ive been tracking. 

the only one to stick out is SAFEMARS
 
seemingly obscure, but its started a bull run that, if it were a rug pull, wouldnt be happening.

i invested 20$. for nearly two week that $20 bag was see sawing between $5 and $10.but a couple days ago it became $20 again. right now its worth $160. 

i also bought at the height of a small bull run, but still, SAFEMARS is trading at only $0.00000074 

in comparison, SAFEMOON is on a much milder bull run, but at $0.000005742 or  775% higher. just getting there would result in significant gains

ive followed the paths of the coin that takes place for each sale, and all do appear to match what the white paper explains. 

i know there were concerns over tokens not really being burned, and while i cant prove they are actually destroyed, they arent moving from what appears to be the  lack hole of token death. 

[here is](https://www.certik.org/projects/safemars) certiks skynet report on the asset, which they score at 90/100. 

to put that into perspective, tether (USDT) also has a 90/100. 
AAVE has an 87/100
and MATIC has a 78/100


also, you should just use certiks [database](https://www.certik.org/) before investing in anything, to check risks. 


but all in all, this community seem to be determined to hodl, the devs dont appear to be hiding anything, or intend to scam investors, and this bull run has enough momentum to keep going for a while. 


i am not cashing out my investment, as that would evade the purpose of it, so i intend to ride this right back down. 

but if you do invest (in anything like this) and want to recoup your costs, take a little profit, or panic sell, just do so in small, paced out transactions that dont impact the coin price. all it take is one person to liquidate a large amount at once to potentially cause a domino effect. 

also , this is not a recommendation to invest in this asset (or any asset as I'm not a financial advisor, I'm just a typical idiot). 

I'm basically pulling an amy poehler in mean girls, when she offers her 16 y/o daughters friends alcohol, on the contingency they planned to drink elsewhere, and would instead remain under her supervision. 

if youre going to take a risk, as of now, SAFEMARS appears to pose the lowest threat, when compared to the rest of  the memecoins in this overflowing reservior of identical liquidity staking/dispersment/burn useless token that have become popular almost instantly in recent weeks. 

*as mentioned, this is not financial advice, merely perception from closely watching, and researching this particular asset, compared to other similar assets*",0,2021-04-20 03:27:29,2

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,MANTRA DAO Is Expanding to Polygon (former Matic)!,"Ethereum startup [Matic Network](https://matic.network/) is rebranding to **Polygon** as it goes all-in on further Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions. The India-based firm is pivoting toward addressing Ethereum’s throughput problem with a forthcoming layer 2 aggregation SDK that can host multiple technologies at once, according to a blog post shared with CoinDesk. 

[https://www.publish0x.com/paragism/matic-becomes-polygon-ethereums-internet-of-blockchains-xmkrpmr](https://www.publish0x.com/paragism/matic-becomes-polygon-ethereums-internet-of-blockchains-xmkrpmr)

Now **Mantra Dao** will be taking the next step by expanding their support for Polygon, which means they are developing additional Polygon versions of the dApps that will have on-chain transactions paid in MATIC tokens. This all comes on the heels of the recent announcement that the [OM token will be the first to list on the Polygon-based, multi-token farming solution platform, GalaxyFarm!](https://medium.com/mantra-dao/mantra-dao-becomes-one-of-the-first-farming-pools-with-galaxyfarm-fbe0f8fff55b)

*“While we will continue to be a Polkadot-first project, our core proposition as a DeFi platform is to be chain-agnostic and offer low-cost solutions for our Sherpa community. We believe that a focus on interoperability and cross-chain functionality will be one of the main drivers of the continued growth of blockchain ecosystems.*

*We at MANTRA DAO have followed Polygon’s development journey for a long time and have been incredibly impressed with their transformation. As Polygon is now quickly becoming a leading Layer 2 aggregators for Ethereum, which combines multiple L2 scaling approaches including sidechains, Optimistic Rollups, zk Rollups, and Plasma, we believe that the future of the platform will see exponential growth in dApps being developed on-chain”.*

[**https://medium.com/mantra-dao/mantra-dao-is-expanding-to-polygon-matic-50c263178eab**](https://medium.com/mantra-dao/mantra-dao-is-expanding-to-polygon-matic-50c263178eab)

**POLYGON future:**

Polygon will also be able to launch whole blockchains, similar to Parity Technologies’ Substrate. Blockchains launched on Polygon inherit the security assumptions of the underlying Ethereum blockchain, just as Substrate-based chains can plug into Polkadot’s ecosystem to gain security, Polygon core developer Mihailo Bjelic said in a phone interview.

Matic Network’s rebranding is ambitious. The project wants to be Ethereum’s Internet of Blockchains. The existing solutions remain fully functional and MATIC token will be continuing to act as the governance token of the platform. The project is basically expanding their visions. Matic is not a new project. The project was initiated in 2017 to provide a better world to carry Ethereum transactions and their Plasma implementation was one of the first successful implementations of the concept originally given by Vitalik Buterin.

The MATIC token will continue to play a vital role in securing and incentivizing the network, with added value and functionality introduced by the layer-2 and sidechain integrations that benefit scalability in the space.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/matic-network-now-polygon-as-platform-targets-ethereums-l2-woes-2021-02-09](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/matic-network-now-polygon-as-platform-targets-ethereums-l2-woes-2021-02-09)

Polygon’s strategy, if successfully implemented, could have major repercussions on the Ethereum ecosystem. Its [new “rollup-centric” roadmap](https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-outlines-next-steps-for-ethereum-after-beacon-chain-launch) would see shards being used to tether a variety of layer-two solutions. But while sharded architectures incorporate cross-shard communication by design, interoperability between layer-two chains is less immediate and often requires going through the main Ethereum blockchain first. For projects in decentralized finance, where easy composability is key, this issue could mean that they would have to pick “the winning rollup” even if it may be overcrowded or otherwise not suitable for their needs. Thus, easy interoperability could be key to ensuring that Ethereum’s current roadmap offers practical scalability for DApps.",7,2021-03-04 15:23:55,0
USDT,CryptoMoonShots,New crypto theft,"Here is a short prehistory. In February Shixuan Cai bought 300,900 USDT. Then he transferred it from the exchange to his personal wallet. In less than five minutes the whole amount was transferred to another wallet. The important thing here is that these assets were owned not by Cai personally, it was the partners' amount. And the second transfer was made without the business’ partner permission. Then it turned out that Cai’s partner Lin Jian Chen kept the private key written in the Evernote, a service for creating notes. It seems that hackers used VPN service as a cover, found the key, and used it to make transactions. In April the theft was reported, and Tether and the U.S Secret Service started the investigation. Shortly after, a man named Kamil contacted an agent. It turned out that the funds were transferred to him. As a result, Tether unfroze the funds and they remained in the U.S government possession.

First of all, this case was a new challenge for crypto legislation. It is impossible to find a solution for such a case without some basic laws. It is also a good reminder for users to be more conscious about private keys.   
What about you? Are you careful enough?",4,2020-10-27 12:27:59,0
USDT,CryptoMoonShots,BOT (Bounce Finance) Decentralized auction protocol,"This is complicated, I don't even know where to start.

It is in a way like Uniswap but it is also not. Protocol calls itself ""decentralized auction protocol"". Fees are 0,2% (unlike 0,3% from Uniswap). This would be introduction article:

[https://medium.com/@bouncefinance/bounce-finance-6c581fdd2850](https://medium.com/@bouncefinance/bounce-finance-6c581fdd2850)

Staking started few days ago and here it is explained:

[https://medium.com/@bouncefinance/introducing-dynamic-bot-staking-c4a86515e9c0](https://medium.com/@bouncefinance/introducing-dynamic-bot-staking-c4a86515e9c0)

I strongly suggest reading these couple of articles to get idea what is it about:

[https://cryptogems.com/bounce-finance-bot-review-decentralized-auction-and-swap-protocol-by-ankr-ceo/](https://cryptogems.com/bounce-finance-bot-review-decentralized-auction-and-swap-protocol-by-ankr-ceo/)

This is etherscan contract:

[https://etherscan.io/token/0x5bEaBAEBB3146685Dd74176f68a0721F91297D37](https://etherscan.io/token/0x5bEaBAEBB3146685Dd74176f68a0721F91297D37)

This is website:

[https://bounce.finance/](https://bounce.finance/)

I am not providing liquidity there (mining) so I am not sure what are their rewards, I belive they are getting most of the rewards (like 70% or something).

But stakers with the current percentage of the pool get around 0.01 ETH per day per BOT token. Price is very volatile since nobody wants to sell it.

[https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0xe444f079e8f69ee32b2707974b5c994fa7dd944a](https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0xe444f079e8f69ee32b2707974b5c994fa7dd944a)

&#x200B;

Staking rewards are paid out daily with each cycle which starts / ends at 00:00 UTC

There are couple of things to be taken into consideration:

1. this is still very very early project and upgrades on platform are being made constantly. most two important people on the team are Jack Lu as main developer and co-founder–Chandler Song who is also the CEO of ANKR. They are making updates all the time and listen to community regarding user experience on the platform.
2. you need to pick up your rewards DAILY so if you have like 2 BOT and you receive 0.02 ETH daily reward, it is obviously not in your best interest to stake considering you will pay 0,01 gas fees in ETH for withdraw contract daily but this will be changed with time.
3. nobody is shilling this or spreading around or talking much about staking here since everyone is happy with current 0,01 ETH per BOT per day (the less stakers, the higher rewards ofcourse) and nobody is taking time to see what is real market cap of the project. Miners are daily spending around 450 USD (in ethereum fees for contracts, it is complicated) to mine 1 BOT (which is trading around 500 USD right now) and maximum of 150 BOT can be mined daily (this was already reduced down from 300).
4. over past few days gas prices were skyrocketing to like 140-150-160 gwei and I noticed that when gas prices go down, platform is much more used (I can see by the amount locked in rewards pool ) and tether is moved to OMG as L2, which would mean less fees. I dont know how many exchanges implemented that, but network is today less clogged .
5. circulating supply:

maximum of 100.000 BOT can ever exist. Take etherscan link which I posted up there and under holders remove first 2 addresses (67.243 + 28.500 = 95.743) which means only 4267 BOT is circulating supply.

Beside constant updates, yesterday was Korean version launched as well. I know that GUI isn't the prettiest but it is simple and it works and I belive with time they will work on that as well. Right now they are all about coding. You can for example create private pool if you wanna exchange something with specifically 1 person, and you just send him link to the pool.

Sorry for long post but I think everyone should think about this as long term investment, and in meanwhile you can earn ETH as rewards. There are a lot of medium articles on this, if anyone is interested.",1,2020-08-20 12:43:59,1
USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Lamden: Building Powerful Blockchains with a Simple Developer Experience,"The *hour* of DeFi is upon us…

Over the past year, the blockchain sector was once again rocked by massive disruption in the form of decentralized finance (known by its catchy moniker “DeFi”). DeFi isn't a single product as some people think; rather, you can think of it as a series of paradigm shifts which collectively enable you to access financial products and services — both traditional and innovative. Thanks to blockchain technology, all this is done in a decentralized, trustless environment, so you don't have to rely on a trusted intermediary.

As it stands, Ethereum is the favoured blockchain network for building dApps and DeFi solutions, but a number of issues have emerged in the wake of the recent DeFi 'boom'. Chiefly, the network's scalability issues have been exposed, up to the point where most users are priced out of DeFi protocols ([Uniswap and Tether](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/people-have-spent-almost-7m-on-eth-gas-for-uniswap%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1601492471709000%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw19Z49LlZY2kNjrjBMiSmen&sa=D&ust=1601492471718000&usg=AFQjCNEWvYx2C7na_SEqBzfjdn7xyWhXyw) remain the top two culprits). More than once, gas fees for processing on-chain transactions [reached record highs](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-scalability-issues-exposed-as-high-gas-fees-stall-defi-boom%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1601492471709000%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw2lCESdOqxO3mgS3Ux___tm&sa=D&ust=1601492471718000&usg=AFQjCNHkO2EH2-I49_dDB6GJpYEeRv3LLQ) due to the number of DeFi protocols (and resulting bump in user base) launched on the Ethereum network lately.

This (parasitic) fee structure, or the lack thereof, could negatively impact Ethereum's usability in the long run. As the DeFi space continues to experience increased user activity, this would push the transaction volume beyond the network’s limits. As a direct consequence, network congestion will lead to a higher number of unconfirmed transactions, longer wait times and higher gas fees as users race against one another to get their transactions confirmed faster.

These bottlenecks could make some smart contracts virtually unusable, an extremely key issue for the future of Ethereum as a dApp platform. Of course, you could cite Layer 2 patches like OMG Network’s Plasma and zkRollups as a potential solution, but we all know they lack generalized smart contract support, which is needed to move dApps out of the increasingly costly Ethereum mainnet.

Another potential solution could be to make the Ethereum blockchain and the smart contracts running on the network more efficient. However, that may prove too big to pull off on demand. For one, it’d require an overhaul in Ethereum’s codebase (read: no quick fix, but years down the line), not to mention participation from smart contract owners en masse.

Despite [Ethereum’s moves](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-devs-discuss-gas-optimizations-but-it-will-probably-be-too-little-too-late%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1601492471710000%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1kQQ5OJTFpq07tLzRoDVrF&sa=D&ust=1601492471719000&usg=AFQjCNGGzoLWh3rciCamzA6PpvL9m6h4Kw) to fix its surge in network fees (notably through EIP 2929), most people feel there's much work to be done in order to improve the network.

Thankfully, there’s a much better alternative to Ethereum. In Lamden, a viable solution to Ethereum’s key issues of scalability and performance presents itself. Lamden is a platform for blockchain development in Python, with network transaction speeds reaching up to 10,000 TPS & fixed transaction costs cheaper than you've ever seen before.

Lamden has been in development and testing for more than two years, and the mainnet was successfully launched in September 2020. With a Delegated Proof of Committee (DPOC) governance model featuring hot reloading, Lamden solves L1 issues on the mainnet, without having to implement second-layer band-aids (zkRollups like zkSync and Optimistic, or scaling solutions like Loopring and Plasma Childchain).

More than that, Lamden supports dynamic block sizes, atomic token swaps built directly into the wallet, no gas static fee structure, paying smart contract devs and reactive block times. At an impressive transaction speed of 10,000 TPS, Lamden is able to scale to handle real-world transactions.

**Build Scalable, High-performance dApps on Lamden**

Lamden provides a robust set of development tools and Python libraries, which allow you to develop complex ideas faster and with less work. With native support for an easily accessible language like Python, Lamden serves as a low entry point for developers looking to start their foray into dApp development using a suite of ‘convenient’, user-friendly tools.

By leveraging Lamden’s 10,000-TPS speed, you can build robust dApps that maintain peak performance at scale. Nodes on the Lamden network process incoming work immediately, instead of waiting for a preset block size or time, as seen with most blockchains. This implies that transactions can be processed near-instantly and finality achieved in as little as 400 milliseconds.

Now you can build high-performance dApps that are secure, scalable, and interoperable with a blockchain toolkit that ensures you’re development ready, day one. With Lamden, it’s all about improving the developer experience, and you can develop a broad range of DeFi solutions like DEXes, digital banking platforms, prediction markets, and more.

**Build Better. Build Faster.**

Python is one of the most popular programming languages used by developers in various domains like web and software development, data science, machine learning, DevOps and AI. Currently, it’s the fastest-growing language in the world with hundreds of libraries and frameworks like scikit-learn, OpenCV and TensorFlow for machine learning, Django and Flask for web development, matplotlib and NumPy for data science, and NLTK for natural language processing.

The Lamden blockchain natively integrates with Python for dApp development, allowing you to easily build decentralized applications five times faster than other blockchains. To top it off, being the first choice for most programmers, Python has a strong developer community with a huge online presence. Therefore, it stands to reason that more robust dApps will be launched on Lamden once the platform gains popularity in the Python dev community.

Thanks to Lamden's smart contract functionality and modular approach to dApp development, you can build highly scalable blockchains across every space. By implementing Python's vast library of modules and packages, you can develop (and deploy) dApps in less time.

**Fostering a Sustainable Blockchain Ecosystem for MMORPGs and NFTs**

Blockchain gaming and in-game items are now a thing, with several smart contract platforms shifting their focus to NFTs.

Lamden's fast transaction times and a global database allows you to make massive multiplayer role-playing games and social applications in a matter of minutes. With Lamden, you can design, build & deploy huge MMORPGs that can execute complex logic directly on the blockchain with zero chance of cheating. You can monetize your games better by leveraging true digital scarcity with in-game currencies and NFTs, and earn 90% of transaction fees processed through your dApp's smart contracts.

**DeFi on Lamden**

Per ConsenSys, DeFi solutions should be interoperable, composable and programmable to be truly decentralized. Here’s exactly how Lamden satisfies these three pillars of DeFi.

Interoperability: Interoperability refers to the ability to exchange and make use of information across different protocols and blockchains. Lamden enables the seamless exchange of information and value across various dApps built on the platform.

Programmability: Programmability generally implies that information (in this case, value) is controlled by smart contracts, not people. Lamden uses a smart contract library Contracting which is built on the Python VM. This system allows developers to write small applications for the types of program logic we see in smart contracts today. This generally has to do with simple logical transactions, so you spend less time with low-level details of systems architecture and more time developing your dApp.

Composability: a system is termed “composable” when the entire system can be selected and assembled in various combinations that fit perfectly together to satisfy user requirements. Lamden uses a modular approach to dApp development, allowing you to build *Lego*\-pieced dApps which can fit perfectly into other dApps built with Lamden.

For instance, you’ve developed a DEX, so naturally,  you’d need to maintain the transparency and reliability of pricing information on the exchange. Instead of using an external blockchain oracle or centralized market aggregator, you simply cull price data from an oracle built on Lamden by just plugging it into your codebase — like a module!

All in all, Lamden provides developers with the necessary tools to foster a truly interoperable, programmable and composable financial system, thereby reducing the cost of scaling network performance.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Solaris (XLR)," Solaris is a decentralized open source cryptocurrency focused on privacy, innovation and advancement of technology. Its environmentally friendly consensus protocol and supporting masternode network establishes Solaris as a secure, decentralized, self-sustaining, and privacy-focused cryptocurrency with instant transactions for everyday use . (I this from copied from their website)

&#x200B;

Some of the reasons I think XLR has the moonshot potential.

  
Proof of Stake  only, Proof of work has ended. The algorithm used is Xevan which has low power usage. The power use makes XLR an attractive coin to stake without having to worry about balancing the power costs/reward ratio in mind, unlike many other cryptos still in their proof of work state.

&#x200B;

Currently has over 50% of the supply locked into masternodes.

Supply is at 1.5M coins and grows roughly 100k each year (not the exact number but its close). The low supply means that adding a low number of users pushes the price dramatically. The low supply and current user base is a double edged sword, when someone dumps their holdings it also pushes the price down dramatically.

The cost from transactions go back to users in the form of rewards for masternode holders, and users actively staking their coins in the wallet.

&#x200B;

An exchange is being built ([txbit.io](https://txbits.io)) that will increase the rewards to the coin holders via masternodes and staking. I am hopeful the exchange will increase the user base of XLR, or at least draw in outside crypto traders to effectively increase the usage of the XLR network via trade fees. Rewards are via the wallet, you don't have to send coins to the exchange to receive them

The exchange will not include any tether/fiat style currencies to ensure that users can stay anonymous. This does reduce the current ease of returning your earning to fiat, but many user prefer the anonymity over ease of returning to Fiat.

&#x200B;

The Dev Team of Solaris and txbits have regular updates usually weekly, but sometimes longer.  
Which is not necessary, but its nice to see they are working hard, with regular updates.

&#x200B;

The TLDR: low coin supply, rewards for coin holders from usage fee and from the [txbit.io](https://txbit.io) trade fees, I'm speculating on an increasing user base because of the txbit exchange.",8,2018-10-04 15:49:44,5

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,BabyTether 💸 Hold $BabyTether — earn $USDT ✅ CERTIK audited & passed KYC ✅ New Reflection GEM on BSC! 💎 Pre-sale on January 22!,"**Join TG:** [**https://t.me/BabyTetherApp**](https://t.me/BabyTetherApp)

# Introduction

*BabyTether is a new token in the Binance Smart Chain network, which allows each holder to receive permanent passive earnings, paid in $USDT.*

*What could be more stable and more confident than receiving rewards immediately in $?*

*Every week, tokens appear that pay rewards to holders in the form of other tokens (BNB, CAKE, ADA, AVAX, Dogecoin and so on). You depend at once on the price of two tokens: on the token that you are holding and on the other token in which you are credited with rewards. Of course, you can immediately sell the second token and convert it into dollars, but these are unnecessary actions, an unnecessary waste of attention and inconvenience. Especially if you are relaxing somewhere on the islands, drinking Pina Colada. Or you can hold the token that you receive as a reward, but this is an additional risk. The risk of the market falling, respectively, of this token.*

*Our team really likes the idea of ​​projects that pay rewards to holders immediately in the form of stablecoins (USDT, BUSD). But in reality, there are very few such high-quality projects on the market. That is why we are here!*

*Think about it. Why do you need extra actions? Why do you need additional risk, which is already enough in cryptocurrency? We do not see the need for this and are more inclined towards stability, to constancy. And there is nothing more stable in cryptocurrency than stablecoins. Regardless of the market, whether it goes up or down, you will always know that you have dollars in your portfolio that you can always use in real life. Better yet, when the market falling, you will have the funds to buy back the altcoins (which other projects offer you as rewards, haha) at even lower prices.*

*BabyTeather is not just a meme token, without functionality. Our team wants to make a great story out of this project. Something like BabyDogeCoin.. A wonderful project and wonderful admins. And we intend to repeat their success, but in a much more stable and acceptable form for ordinary people.*

*If you give a choice to an ordinary person who is not very familiar with cryptocurrency to buy a coin and receive rewards for it in CAKE/BNB/Dogecoin.. or in $, what will he choose? The answer is obvious. And our mission is to distribute BabyTether not in a narrowly focused way only in the cryptocurrency community, but by embracing a large number of ordinary people who are just starting to study the cryptocurrency world.*

# Features

**7% Redistribution in USDT**  
7% of every buy/sell is taken and redistributed to all holders. Hold $BabyTether tokens, earn USDT. A Minimum of 200,000 tokens is required in order to receive rewards.

**Rewards Paid Automatically**  
For the first time ever, you don’t need to claim your earned USDT. It’s automatically sent to your wallet. Just add the Tether USD token ($USDT) address to your wallet and you're set.

Marketing wallet: [https://bscscan.com/address/0x9327fb6c88fa9e6abe7c9cf2f327fe5e48c5fd4c](https://bscscan.com/address/0x9327fb6c88fa9e6abe7c9cf2f327fe5e48c5fd4c)

**Calculator (coming soon)**  
[https://calculator.babytether.app/](https://calculator.babytether.app/)

**BabyTether Swap (coming soon)**  
[https://swap.babytether.app/](https://swap.babytether.app/)

**Buy via Card (coming soon)**  
[https://buy.babytether.app/](https://buy.babytether.app/)  
It will become even easier for ordinary people to buy the BabyTether token! It is enough to make a payment directly with your bank card, after which you will receive BNB to the specified wallet, which you can exchange for BabyTether tokens in the Swap tab. 

# Dividend Distribution Mechanism

The dividend mechanism incentivizes token holders to hold in order to earn dividends from the transactions (buys and sells).

    The dividends are not dependent on the price of BabyTether. They are based purely on the volume and proportional to the BabyTether amount you hold in your wallet.

* All $USDT the contract gains are split proportionally between the token holders
* To receive dividends a minimum token balance of 200,000 BabyTether is required to be held in a wallet
* The contract keeps track of all the dividends due to each holder in a list
* Every transaction processes a certain number of users from the list
* The number of holders processed through each transaction is dynamic and based on transaction size
* Holders will receive dividends from the queue based on their position in the list
* It’s a fair system, fully automated

# Security

**The BabyTether team has taken several steps to ensure optimal security:**

1. The liquidity pool is locked for 12 months using the PinkSale platform
2. BabyTether contract address has been audited by one of the most popular and trustworthy companies CERTIK: [https://www.certik.com/projects/babytether](https://www.certik.com/projects/babytether)
3. The Founder of BabyTether provided the full KYC on the PinkSale, with documents and video confirmation (on the pre-sale page you can see confirmation of this)
4. 5% of the team tokens are locked for 12 months with linear unlocking (more information on the pre-sale page)

  NFT Card Collective tokaen with 12 % USDT reward distributed to every holders. **Swap your USDT to**   
  **USD and withdraw to your Bank Card in 2min**. Audited with Tech Audit and Verified contract with   
  Pinksale Finance**.** Our goal is to give something brand new which would boost the holders’ asset   
  value. We have kept the supply very low – at 900,000 tokens – which will be very beneficial for the   
  holders.  
 

  Compared to the several hundred other tokens, this is a fraction of the supply which the other   
  projects have determined at the start and will allow us to exponentially boost the value of our token.   
  Along with a fairly low supply, our most attractive feature is the rewards scheme for the users   
  composed of giving away a 12% USDT premium to every CRH holder.   
 

  This is a two-in-one impressive combination giving customers an opportunity to benefit both from a   
  capital gain and a passive income. To make our mark in the crypto world, we are also planning to   
  launch an NFT shop with a huge Asian marketing campaign on the largest NFT marketplace Opensea.

This service based approach will be supported by a marketplace where this tooling will be facilitated and distributed.

Since the whitepaper release TetherMoon went X3 from 470k MC to 1.38 million MC! Last 4 days since the release of the whitepaper TetherMoon kept pushing up and broke its all-time high twice. Of course this price action has a reason. Do not miss out on this next 100X moon shot, because this block-chain project can put a big stamp on the crypto space!

Compete against friends or strangers for crypto on ANY game on ANY platform, providing the game can be streamed to Twitch, Facebook Gaming or YouTube gaming. 

We help match up like-minded gamers who want to play each other for crypto, and in order to do that completely fairly, we will be offering the services of our team of completely anonymous and completely neutral and unbiased Esports Referees who will watch you play your game via Twitch, YouTube Gaming, or Facebook Gaming live stream. Dispute the result? No problem.... simply raise a dispute and the payout will be suspended until the stream archive is reviewed by our team of experts, who have the power to override the referees decision if necessary.

Perhaps you prefer to watch others play? Esports and game viewing figures are increasing year-on-year, so why not earn crypto whilst doing something you'd be happy to do for free? EsportsRef team referees earn a fee for each game they mediate, with an opportunity to level-up over time to a senior, all-star, or even legendary referee, with additional bonuses!

Esports players and casual gamers can either compete for ESR tokens, or alternatively xDai stable coin. When players are ready to play, they each deposit an equal sum of ESR/xDai into a secure “smart contract” stored on the Gnosis blockchain. You can think of this smart contract as a type of escrow wallet, that has some very smart capabilities built into it.

Once both players have stored their ESR/xDai into the smart contract, Esportsref will appoint a referee who loves watching others play games online!

The referee will already be online and available, and will be immediately notified via email and instant message of a pending game which they have been asked to referee!

Players compete online and stream to Twitch, Facebook Gaming or YouTube gaming, and the referee will award a winner, you will receive their crypto directly to their wallet. In the even of any dispute, bother players/teams can request that the result is disputed.

Possible outcomes of dispute:

1.  The team agrees with the dispute raised, and overrides the decision made by the referee and the crypto is released to the correct winner. The referee will either be warned, or in some instances banned from the platform.

2.  The team disagrees with the dispute raised, and the original winner is awarded their crypto. The player who raised the dispute will be warned, or in some instances banned from the platform.

This is done in order to adjust the token price, without affecting the value of anyone’s share of coins. This can be beneficial as the chart will always look healthy regardless of dips and we can be on the top gainers parts of websites due to the illusion of a rise in price floor so is a brilliant marketing tool in itself.

What is our uniqueness?

We don't unnecessarily rebased. It will only happen when there is a huge price drop along with the buyback. It will be stealth to prevent potential price manipulation.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,"USDTATSU Public Presale Today on PinkSale 14:00 UTC! Passive income paid every minute 5% USDT forever on all transactions | P2E, NFTs & Airdrop Platform!","Welcome to USDTATSU,
Telegram:  usdtatsu

Public PinkSale Presale Today! Starts 14:00 UTC

While trading in cryptocurrencies has always been exciting, investing in tokens and pulling out when the time is right, investors are now looking for safer returns. And it led to the increased demand for projects offering passive income. However, since the need for it arose after the recent market crash, there are not many reliable projects in the space. But that changes with the release of USDTATSU, a project planning to offer top passive income to users.
USDATSU is developed on the Binance Smart Chain and will offer a bunch of utilities, including P2E gaming, Airdrop platform, and NFT collection. Anyone even remotely acquainted with the market dynamics will realize that the three domains have had a tremendous last couple of years, and their demand has grown more than ever. USDTATSU plans to create an ecosystem with advanced protocols, one never seen before, and offer investors a high and stable passive income. The ecosystem is still expanding, and you can expect more functionalities to be added in the coming days.
USDTATSU has developed a rather interesting game where users can fly around with their dragons. Easter eggs found during these expeditions will help players claim free $USDTATSU, and that’s the play-to-earn part. Also, dragons can be made stronger through alien fights or competing against other players on the platform. And the best part, you can use USDTATSU NFTs as skins in the game. So, the NFTs minted from the project’s collection, in addition to being an excellent investment, will also have utility in the game. The game will be released after the NFT collection goes live.
Once these two are available to users, USDTATSU will launch its Airdrop platform. Users can then stake their tokens and receive airdrops from various verified and investment-worthy projects. Staking has become a popular investment choice amongst the community, and USDTATSU will take it to the next level.
About the $USDTATSU token 
While the concept of USDTATSU is bound to create a storm, there’s another reason why investors will throng it. USDTATSU will offer investors 5% rewards in USDT, a stablecoin, from the moment the official token is listed on PanCakeSwap, which will go on till eternity.
The total supply of $USDTATSU is capped at 100,000,000, of which 50% would be reserved for presale and liquidity, 16% locked on PinkSale for game rewards, DEX, and CEX, 4% would be allocated as Team Tokens and locked until 2022.10.01, while another 4% would be deposited in the marketing wallet and optimally utilized to promote the project further. The token allocation has been done considering the market dynamics and the tokenomics of other successful projects in the De-Fi space.
USDTATSU will launch the pre-sale of its native token on September 17, 2022, at 14:00 UTC, and it will be available on PinkSale. The project has already been audited by Analytix Audit, has gotten the contracts verified, and will undergo doxxing after launch to build trust amongst the community and possible investors. So, go ahead and invest in $USDTATSU during the pre-sale while the prices are still low because once the token starts trading on exchanges, the value is expected to shoot through the roof.

Easter eggs found during these expeditions will help players claim free $USDTATSU, and that’s the play-to-earn part. Also, dragons can be made stronger through alien fights or competing against other players on the platform. And the best part, you can use USDTATSU NFTs as skins in the game. So, the NFTs minted from the project’s collection, in addition to being an excellent investment, will also have utility in the game. The game will be released after the NFT collection goes live.

Once these two are available to users, USDTATSU will launch its Airdrop platform. Users can then stake their tokens and receive airdrops from various verified and investment-worthy projects. Staking has become a popular investment choice amongst the community, and USDTATSU will take it to the next level.

**About the $USDTATSU token** 

While the concept of USDTATSU is bound to create a storm, there’s another reason why investors will throng it. USDTATSU will offer investors 5% rewards in USDT, a stablecoin, from the moment the official token is listed on PanCakeSwap, which will go on till eternity.

The total supply of $USDTATSU is capped at 100,000,000, of which 50% would be reserved for presale and liquidity, 16% locked on PinkSale for game rewards, DEX, and CEX, 4% would be allocated as Team Tokens and locked until 2022.10.01, while another 4% would be deposited in the marketing wallet and optimally utilized to promote the project further. The token allocation has been done considering the market dynamics and the tokenomics of other successful projects in the De-Fi space.

USDTATSU will launch the pre-sale of its native token on September 17, 2022, at 14:00 UTC, and it will be available on PinkSale. The project has already been audited by Analytix Audit, has gotten the contracts verified, and will undergo doxxing after launch to build trust amongst the community and possible investors. So, go ahead and invest in $USDTATSU during the pre-sale while the prices are still low because once the token starts trading on exchanges, the value is expected to shoot through the roof.

Also, follow the platform on all social media platforms to stay updated with the latest development and releases.

Cryptocurrency is a form of payment that can be exchanged online for goods and services. Many companies have issued their own currencies, often called tokens, and these can be traded specifically for the good or service that the company provides. Think of them as you would arcade tokens or casino chips. You’ll need to exchange real currency for the cryptocurrency to access the good or service.

&#x200B;

Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain network built for running smart contract-based applications. BSC runs in parallel with Binance’s native Binance Chain (BC), which allows users to get the best of both worlds: the high transaction capacity of BC and the smart contract functionality of BSC

&#x200B;

Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized technology spread across many computers that manages and records transactions. Part of the appeal of this technology is its security.",795,2022-02-24 18:06:34,37

🔥 **There is a new project that can go even further** 🔥

✅ **STEM** is a sports team statistics token exchange. On this exchange, each sports club will have its own tokens, which have value. The price of these tokens is determined by such indicators as the team's game statistics 📊, world ratings 📈, position in the tournament tables🧾, the value of the club's players 💰 and others.

The mechanics of these tokens are simple. The better a sports team plays, and the better its statistics, the more expensive its tokens will be. 💸

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,"Is arbitrage possible when exchanging Doge coins for USDT using price difference trading on different platforms? yes, it's possible!","Hey, guys! Today we have an interesting topic for discussion – Dogecoin (DOGE). I noticed something interesting: the price of DOGE on Binance is 15% lower than on crypti-cronse, its price is \[0.1281 DOGE/USDT\]. This significant difference in price creates an excellent opportunity for arbitrage.  
  
For those who are not familiar with this term, arbitrage is a trading strategy in which you buy an asset on one exchange at a lower price and sell it on another exchange at a higher price. In our case, you could buy Dogecoin on Binance and sell it on crypti-cronse, earning on the price difference.  
  
Why is there such a difference in prices? This may be due to differences in supply and demand on these exchanges, as well as different trading volumes. But the most important thing for us is the opportunity to make money on this difference.  
  
So, how can we take advantage of this opportunity? First, you need to have accounts on both platforms - Binance and crypti–cronse. Then, you buy Dogecoin on Binance at a lower price. After that, transfer your DOGE to Crypti-Cronse and sell them at a higher price. Do not forget to take into account the transfer and trading fees to make sure that the transaction will really be profitable.  
  
Here are a few steps to help you get started:  
  
Register and complete verification on both platforms.  
Top up your Binance account and buy Dogecoin.  
Transfer Dogecoin to your wallet on [crypti-cronse.com](http://crypti-cronse.com)  
Sell Dogecoin on crypti-cronse at a higher price.  
Of course, this is just one of the many strategies that can be used to trade cryptocurrencies. It is important to be aware of the risks and always conduct your own research before you start trading.  
  
That's it, guys. Thank you for your attention, and see you soon!",12,2024-08-24 22:08:12,18

Cryptocurrency is a form of payment that can be exchanged online for goods and services. Many companies have issued their own currencies, often called tokens, and these can be traded specifically for the good or service that the company provides. Think of them as you would arcade tokens or casino chips. You’ll need to exchange real currency for the cryptocurrency to access the good or service.



Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain network built for running smart contract-based applications. BSC runs in parallel with Binance’s native Binance Chain (BC), which allows users to get the best of both worlds: the high transaction capacity of BC and the smart contract functionality of BSC



Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized technology spread across many computers that manages and records transactions. Part of the appeal of this technology is its security.",497,2022-02-21 06:12:49,26

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,$Elonone - Gasless NFT Marketplace - Play 2 Earn Crypto Game -Vitalik Buterin Burned 38% - $1000 USDT Giveaway," **$1000 USDT GIVEWAY**

0.1 Eth purchase of Elonone per entry. Example: 0.1 Eth = 1 entry and 1 Eth = 10 entries. Entries made *AFTER* the time of this post are included.

\*Draw will be made on Saturday 16th April live on VC.

\*\*You must also NOT sell any Elonone before the draw to qualify.

\*\*\*You can enter as many times as you like. Good luck!

**ABOUT THE TOKEN:**

**$ELONONE** is a utility token that powers a revolutionary new gasless NFT marketplace and a play to earn crypto racing game.

* Gasless NFT Marketplace called AstroZero.
* Play 2 Earn crypto racing game called Rocket Dash
* Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply!
* Liquidity locked for 100 years.
* 13700 holders and rising.
* Low market cap.

**Gasless NFT Marketplace**

Elonone will be the token that powers the revolutionary upcoming gasless NFT marketplace called AstroZero. This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.

AstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.

We strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.

There is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.

Not only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.

We aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.

**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**

* Zero gas fees.
* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%
* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.
* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.
* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.
* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.
* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.

**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**

Elonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.

In Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.

Rockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.

If you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.

Crypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.

**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**

* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!
* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.
* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.

**Liquidity locked for 100 years**

The Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.

He did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.

**13700 holders and rising**

Elonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.

With the project we are building it is easy to see why.

**Low market cap**

At the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.

We are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.

Now is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.

**Tokenomics**

2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.

It pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.

**Info**

* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year
* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit
* Liquidity locked for 100 years
* Listed on CG + CMC
* Strong community rising daily
* Whitepaper released and available on the website
* Contract: 0x97b65710d03e12775189f0d113202cc1443b0aa2

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,WorkQuest offers the benefits of getting paid for work in the $WUSD stablecoin,"Users wield the WUSD a **crypto-backed stablecoin**, native to the WorkQuest platform when creating **a smart contract** between an employer and worker. $WUSD will be issued in three pools of **$WQT, $BNB, $ETH**. The users of the WorkQuest platform can use it to exchange for another cryptocurrency or withdraw to a bank card on the WorkQuest platform.

WUSD primarily targets **employers and employees**, offering them an instrument to **guarantee the cost of work** performed to **avoid volatility** **and loss in fund value** when performing work on the WorkQuest platform. Moreover, getting paid in WUSD is **simpler** and **more beneficial** than any other cryptocurrency (let’s say, for example, Bitcoin) because a person need not rely on a significant market price change before getting paid.

WorkQuest ecosystem includes two tokens: $WQT Governance Token and $WUSD stablecoin. The $WQT token performs a management function. It is used to vote for key aspects for the functioning and survival of the project in terms of risk management, as well as the business logic. The $WQT utilities include:

🔹WorkQuest DAO management   
🔹WorkQuest Referral Program   
🔹Liquidity Mining   
🔹Paid Services on the WorkQuest platform   
🔹Reserve collateral Fund

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,"Dogira (+20%/24hr), a CG-Listed coin lead by an OG Dogecoin Dev, has just announced a $20k USDT Marketing Bounty!","Disclaimer: I'm the OG Dogecoin Dev listed above. This post is as biased as it can possibly get. DYOR before buying into coins. While this post is as usual, not intended as financial advice, you should never take financial advice from people on reddit regardless. Unless you love big bags.

[For transparency: Previous post here regarding my onboarding with the Dogira team.](https://old.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/m8tncl/i_was_one_of_the_original_developers_on_dogecoin/)

----

So, lots happened with Dogira in a relatively short amount of time; We went live on our first CEX, we got listed on CoinGecko, we started doing AMA's with big crypto groups (WhiteBit and Satoshi Club AMA's coming this week!), and we saw a 3-4x price spike before cooling off into consolidation around our current zones. Along with this, we also delivered on our first batch of Investment NFTs; selling out to the tune of $35k in 10 hours!

While the 3-4x price spike was expected on the foot of the news of our roadmap, and team onboarding, it's worth noting here that the team obviously did not start selling off Dogiras; outside of the fact that we'd consider it to be selling on the cheap, we also knew that big spikes on early coins are typically not maintained; and that we needed to focus our efforts into showing more development, and more outreach across communities in order to ensure that we could consolidate in a good area, with catalysts planned ahead to keep the growth healthy.

So, the biggest catalyst coming up this week is our $20k USDT giveaway for our Marketing Bounty program, running through WhiteBit. This will allow people to share in the prizepool of $20k for promoting Dogira; such as getting tweets or videos about Dogira trending, and generally getting the word out there about the coin. As a team, we've worked hard in ensuring that Dogira never gets advertised as ""a quick pump"" or anything of the likes; which is completely against the long-term philosophy we have in the coin. Value needs to get built through tangible developments and noteable results. Now that we have our real foundations in place for the team, we're finally ready to begin marketing the project.

One of our biggest particulars on this was ensuring we had a roadmap up and available which the team could agree to our deadlines on, and begin delivering on immediately. Our full roadmap is up on https://dogira.net for anyone interested in taking a read through; and it details our core goals across 2021, with a heavy focus on further NFT ecosystem expansion, alongside delving into Blockchain Native Gaming.

If you're on the fence, I'd recommend checking out the coin at it's current consolidated/cool-off pricepoint; we've a lot coming ahead this week, and we're all excited to see where it takes us.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,💥Be the Next! - Amnext - $AMC - Unique Concept - Long Term Project - 8400+ Members and not even launched! - Doxxed Devs - No Loss Lottery - Lifetime Tickets - Referral Rewards - Staking - New Concept - Will Launch only when Security Audits are done!,"I have been exploring and evaluating the cryptocurrency world for quite some time now in the crypto community's interest and trying to bring the best and most trustable projects. I had a detailed look at [Amnext’s](https://amnext.io/) [docs](https://docs.amnext.io/) and thought of sharing my detailed review for the DeFi users.

The name Amnext suggests that you can be the next in line to **change your life.** I can say that it breathes life into an ecosystem that can change people’s lives.  
Amnext’s USP is its unique lottery, where **no one loses.** The **Lifetime Tickets do not expire**, and everyone has a chance to hit the jackpots.

***Here Are Some Key Points To Note:***

* Lifetime Tickets
* No-Loss Lottery
* Staking Protocol
* Rewards in AMC by depositing into Prize Pools
* Referral Rewards
* Will not launch until Security Audits are done
* Doxxed Devs

***So, Why Should People Participate?***

1. The entire ecosystem has been built around making sure that you always have a chance to win. The positive features of the Amnext Dapp, as listed below, should encourage the investors to participate in the program.
2. Once you purchase a **Lifetime Ticket**, you enter into the lottery draw for life. This new **UNIQUE concept** of Lifetime Tickets generates the possibility of winning the draw every time the jackpot is generated.
3. For every dollar you deposit on **No-Loss Prize Pools**, you are entitled to win big prizes in form of BNB/CAKE/USDT/BUSD/VAI and earn passive interest of AMC tokens; even if you don’t win, you keep all your money and until you withdraw you are entitled to win!
4. The more the number of people you invite on the Lifetime Tickets Lottery, the more rewards in AMC you will achieve. However, there is a cap on the number of tickets you can get.

***Conclusion***

In my honest and humble opinion, Amnext have a lot of Potential, aside of most DeFi projects you can easily check the Team behind it and their Linkedin/Twitter. It could quickly create a massive market cap and do a **1000x gain** and continue grow in a long term run. For sure not another MEME COIN.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,$Elonone - Gasless NFT Marketplace - Play 2 Earn Crypto Game -Vitalik Buterin Burned 38% - $1000 USDT Giveaway," **$1000 USDT GIVEWAY**

0.1 Eth purchase of Elonone per entry. Example: 0.1 Eth = 1 entry and 1 Eth = 10 entries. Entries made *AFTER* the time of this post are included.

\*Draw will be made on Saturday 16th April live on VC.

\*\*You must also NOT sell any Elonone before the draw to qualify.

\*\*\*You can enter as many times as you like. Good luck!

**ABOUT THE TOKEN:**

**$ELONONE** is a utility token that powers a revolutionary new gasless NFT marketplace and a play to earn crypto racing game.

* Gasless NFT Marketplace called AstroZero.
* Play 2 Earn crypto racing game called Rocket Dash
* Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply!
* Liquidity locked for 100 years.
* 13700 holders and rising.
* Low market cap.

**Gasless NFT Marketplace**

Elonone will be the token that powers the revolutionary upcoming gasless NFT marketplace called AstroZero. This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.

AstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.

We strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.

There is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.

Not only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.

We aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.

**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**

* Zero gas fees.
* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%
* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.
* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.
* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.
* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.
* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.

**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**

Elonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.

In Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.

Rockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.

If you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.

Crypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.

**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**

* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!
* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.
* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.

**Liquidity locked for 100 years**

The Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.

He did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.

**13700 holders and rising**

Elonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.

With the project we are building it is easy to see why.

**Low market cap**

At the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.

We are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.

Now is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.

**Tokenomics**

2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.

It pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.

**Info**

* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year
* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit
* Liquidity locked for 100 years

* Low market cap.

**Gasless NFT Marketplace**

Elonone will be the token that powers the revolutionary upcoming gasless NFT marketplace called AstroZero. This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.

AstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.

We strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.

There is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.

Not only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.

We aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.

**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**

* Zero gas fees.
* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%
* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.
* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.
* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.
* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.
* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.

**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**

Elonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.

In Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.

Rockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.

If you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.

Crypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.

**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**

* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!
* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.
* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.

**Liquidity locked for 100 years**

The Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.

He did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.

**13700 holders and rising**

Elonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.

With the project we are building it is easy to see why.

**Low market cap**

At the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.

We are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.

Now is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.

**Tokenomics**

2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.

It pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.

**Info**

* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year
* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit

**ABOUT THE TOKEN:**

**$ELONONE** is a utility token that powers a revolutionary new gasless NFT marketplace and a play to earn crypto racing game.

* Gasless NFT Marketplace called AstroZero.
* Play 2 Earn crypto racing game called Rocket Dash
* Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply!
* Liquidity locked for 100 years.
* 13700 holders and rising.
* Low market cap.

**Gasless NFT Marketplace**

Elonone will be the token that powers the revolutionary upcoming gasless NFT marketplace called AstroZero. This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.

AstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.

We strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.

There is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.

Not only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.

We aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.

**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**

* Zero gas fees.
* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%
* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.
* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.
* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.
* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.
* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.

**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**

Elonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.

In Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.

Rockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.

If you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.

Crypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.

**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**

* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!
* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.
* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.

**Liquidity locked for 100 years**

The Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.

He did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.

**13700 holders and rising**

Elonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.

With the project we are building it is easy to see why.

**Low market cap**

At the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.

We are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.

Now is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.

**Tokenomics**

2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.

It pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,"Started as memecoin, Chibi is now a proper untility token | less than 3 weeks of launch | unveiling the NFT market","While there are 100s of memetokens doing a hard or soft rug or are not being able to deliver what's promised.

&#x200B;

This team at Chibi has been constantly delivering what they promised to their community. Starting from a 10X launch to 120X on CMC and Coingecko listing, they went ahead and got a CEX listing for the community.

&#x200B;

They are ahead of time in launching the NFT market where you can buy Dog NFTs and the fund would be used by dog shelters to adopt and help dogs in real. Yes, that's a lifetime of donation when people keep buying dog NFTs on Chibi market.

&#x200B;

After a month of launch, they still sustain a minimum 12X from sale price while most other meme tokens have toppled.

&#x200B;

I think these guys are just getting started, maintaining strong levels since sale. Product wise they are launching the first part of the product. Theres so much more to come.

&#x200B;

Best level to ape in, I have attached all links here for your referral.

&#x200B;

Their NFT launch is around this crazy concept of Initial NFT Offering (world's first INO) check their TG for whitelist.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,$Elonone - Gasless NFT Marketplace - Play 2 Earn Crypto Game -Vitalik Buterin Burned 38% - $1000 USDT Giveaway," **$1000 USDT GIVEWAY**

***2 Runners up get $1000 worth of Elonone!***

0.1 Eth purchase of Elonone per entry.

Example: 0.1 Eth = 1 entry and 1 Eth = 10 entries.

Entries made AFTER the time of this post are included.

Draw will be made on Saturday 16th April live on VC.

You must also NOT sell any Elonone before the draw to qualify.

You can enter as many times as you like.

Good luck!

**ABOUT THE TOKEN:**

**$ELONONE** is a utility token that powers a revolutionary new gasless NFT marketplace and a play to earn crypto racing game.

* Gasless NFT Marketplace called AstroZero.
* Play 2 Earn crypto racing game called Rocket Dash
* Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply!
* Liquidity locked for 100 years.
* 13700 holders and rising.
* Low market cap.

**Gasless NFT Marketplace**

Elonone will be the token that powers the revolutionary upcoming gasless NFT marketplace called AstroZero. This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.

AstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.

We strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.

There is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.

Not only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.

We aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.

**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**

* Zero gas fees.
* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%
* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.
* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.
* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.
* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.
* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.

**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**

Elonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.

In Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.

Rockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.

If you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.

Crypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.

**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**

* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!
* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.
* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.

**Liquidity locked for 100 years**

The Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.

He did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.

**13700 holders and rising**

Elonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.

With the project we are building it is easy to see why.

**Low market cap**

At the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.

We are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.

Now is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.

**Tokenomics**

2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.

It pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.

**Info**

* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year
* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit
* Liquidity locked for 100 years

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Nilla Inu | The Cryptocurrency Project with an Unbeatable 8% USDT Reward Mechanism for Token Holders | Active Community and Experienced Developers | App Coming Soon,"Nilla Inu is a revolutionary cryptocurrency project that offers its token holders an incredible 8% USDT reward on every transaction. This reward mechanism is unique in the cryptocurrency space and provides a passive income stream to token holders, encouraging them to hold onto their tokens for longer periods.

The 8% USDT reward mechanism is automatically distributed to all Nilla Inu token holders, and the rewards are distributed proportionally based on the number of tokens held. This means that the more Nilla Inu tokens a holder has, the more USDT rewards they will receive.

What's more, the USDT reward mechanism is sustainable in the long run. A portion of the rewards is used to support the development and marketing of the project, which helps ensure that the token has a long-term vision and strategy for growth.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,StrikeX - $STRX - ( Road to $1 Lambo Giveaway ),"These are my views and my opinion on StrikeX and TradeStrike Ltd. These views do not reflect on an official TradeStrike Team standpoint**

Before I start, here’s a link to my previous [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/s1s4lk/striex_dd_strx_blockchain_advisor/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

**News**

StrikeX will be giving away a Lamborghini as well as some amazing prizes all the way up to $1.00. As seen in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/strikexofficial/status/1482019771977801729?s=21) 

All details needed are in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/strikexofficial/status/1482020183720005636?s=21)

**What are the prizes ?**

* A New York City break for 2 people (Flights included) **($0.20)**

* Rolex & 20,000 STRX **($0.60)**
* 50,000 BUSD **($0.85)**

**How does this work ?** 

A 3+BNB buy will enter you into the Tier 1 giveaway. Tier 1 consists of the NYC holiday, Dubai holiday and 15,000 BUSD. 

A 5+BNB buy will enter you into the Tier 2 giveaway. Tier 2 consists of 75,000 BUSD (one 25,000 BUSD prize and one 50,000 BUSD prize) A Rolex and 25,000 STRX and finally, the most awaited, Lamborghini. 

Each prize has a price target, once these targets are hit and remain at or above the target price for 3 consecutive days then the winners will be drawn.

For the Lamborghini, the winner will be drawn once the price remains at or above $1 for 7 consecutive days. 

**When will the Lamborghini be bought ?**

The Lamborghini will be bought at $0.65 and will be used for marketing purposes. 

**How long will the giveaway run for ?**

The giveaway will run until all price targets are hit or until 31 December 2022.

**Can I enter even if some target prices have been hit ?**

Yes. You will be able to enter all the way up till the end of the giveaway.

**Are my entries only for one prize ?**

No. Your entries are valid until you either win the prizes or until the giveaway has ended. Please bare in mind that if you only have 1 entry then you can only win 1 prize.

**Conclusion**

Even I didn’t expect this ! The prizes up for grabs are some of the best prizes I’ve seen a Crypto company offer. I am most definitely getting myself an entry or two. 

This announcement is a win win for everyone, those who enter **and** those who don’t. Either way, every single person is earning money. There should be no complaints with this announcement. 

Ben Phillips and Thomas Smith have both tweeted out this giveaway too, this will bring so much attention to us. Last time I checked, over 200BNB has already been entered. I can’t wait to see this number in a weeks time ! 

Well done to the StrikeX team, the marketing team and the community. You all deserve this.

Anyways, Here’s to Health, Wealth and Prosperity 🍻⚡️

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,🏆 🎁 Tired of Meme Coins? Check this | Pre-Launch | No Loss Lottery | Lifetime Tickets | Referral Rewards | Fair Launch | Doxxed Devs Team | Long Term Project 💎," I have been exploring and evaluating the cryptocurrency world for quite some time now in the crypto community's interest and trying to bring the best and most trustable projects. I had a detailed look at [Amnext’s](https://amnext.io/) [docs](https://docs.amnext.io/) and thought of sharing my detailed review for the DeFi users.

The name Amnext suggests that you can be the next in line to **change your life.** I can say that it breathes life into an ecosystem that can change people’s lives.  
Amnext’s USP is its unique lottery, where **no one loses.** The **Lifetime Tickets do not expire**, and everyone has a chance to hit the jackpots.

***Here Are Some Key Points To Note:***

* Lifetime Tickets
* No-Loss Lottery
* Farm Rewards ( Liquidity Mining )
* Referral Rewards
* Fair Launch
* Will not launch until Audits are done
* Development Team can be checked on Linkedin/Twitter

***So, Why Should People Participate?***

1. The entire ecosystem has been built around making sure that you always have a chance to win. The positive features of the Amnext Dapp, as listed below, should encourage the investors to participate in the program.
2. Once you purchase a **Lifetime Ticket**, you enter into the lottery draw for life. This new **UNIQUE concept** of Lifetime Tickets generates the possibility of winning the draw every time the jackpot is generated.
3. For every dollar you deposit on **No-Loss Prize Pools**, you are entitled to win big prizes in form of BNB/CAKE/USDT/BUSD/VAI and earn passive interest of AMC tokens; even if you don’t win, you keep all your money and until you withdraw you are entitled to win!
4. The more the number of people you invite on the Lifetime Tickets Lottery, the more rewards in AMC you will achieve. However, there is a cap on the number of tickets you can get.

***Conclusion***

In my honest and humble opinion, Amnext have a lot of Potential aside of most DeFi projects you can easily check the Team behind it and their Linkedin/Twitter. It could quickly create a massive market cap and do a **1000x gain** and continue grow in a long term run.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Royalty Holdings Token $RHT pays weekly dividends in $USDT just for holding. No staking and not a reflection token.,"Passive Income of the Future:

1% tax on every trade goes to a holding portfolio that then pays out earnings/profits every Sunday to holders. The portfolio consists off (stocks, real estate, bonds, crypto, royalties etc.) All holders are paid in $USDT. Four stream channels are also donating their ad revenue to the holding portfolio, so holders can increase their dividends without having to trade, thus creating a positive feedback loop. This is very much a hybrid/merging of a traditional dividend ETF and a crypto.

Due to misinformation, rug pulls, scams, phishing attempts, and costly financial barriers beginner investors are apprehensive to participate in crypto leading them to miss out on legitimate crypto investments. Royalty Holding Token, we want to demystify investing in crypto and return investing power to users by influencing community conversations and the way they can directly impact the value of $RHT. $RHT is able to do this by creating transparency, trust through community involvement, and taking the investor beyond being a bag holder. 

Overall, $RHT is changing the crypto landscape by creating a hybrid of traditional investments that investors control the direction and distance RHT can grow. The main purpose of the token is to hold and earn $USDT every Sunday. The $RHT Project differs because utility is built within the eco system, meaning that users are not waiting on programmatic development for it to be implemented in order to have real world value.

Traditional crypto tokens have moved from proof of work (PoW), algorithm-based mining, to proof of stake (PoS), where investors are rewarded for holding their token. $RHT* revolves around the PoS concept, which rewards investors for holding their token and sending the staked crypto to a contract to earn rewards. Instead, $RHT holders don’t even have to stake their tokens, members get rewarded for holding the tokens in their web3 wallets that support the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) like Metamask.

The $RHT project is founded on transparency and building on where other projects have failed. Unlike burning tokens for large supply coins like Shiba Inu, Paw, and Luna Classic (LUNC), RHT has a supply of 100,000,000 total supply, so unlike other crypto projects, $RHT does not have a large number of tokens, so no need to burn them because $RHTs value continues to grow as more people generate passive revenue through blockchain technology.

Projects that support the RHT ecosystem are Bricks Buster, Prof. Void’s Twitch and Medium, VSMage’s three Twitch Ch’s, and Crypto/Royal Earn Tube who has created the DRIP team where the rewards on Sundays are reinvested back into $RHT. The image below explains why this system benefits the RHT holders. Therefore, the community defends the floor and simultaneously raises the value of $RHT.",9,2023-06-23 19:41:53,9

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,FCFPAY is live and merchants are onboarding | $FCF has closed a MAJOR partnership with a crypto company known worldwide!!| Partnership will be announced next week! |The World's 1st RST token (Revenue sharing token)| Profits from the ecosystem is shared with the community daily!,"The $FCF team has won the Crypto Innovation of the year at the dubai crypto expo! FCF PAY is changing the way the world spend and earn cryptocurrency.

The team has been approached by big entities in dubai and currently have dozens of massive deals on the table. 

Major mainstream marketing campaign signed up with the Chambers group (they represent over 50 household brands)

FCFPay is live and functional, merchants/freelancers/stores have started using it! FCFPAY is the first cryptocurrency payment gateway of its kind. It allows merchants to accept any cryptocurrency as payment!

Partnership with Everly Market is rolling out this month. Fcfpay will be integrated in their network of merchants in the USA.

Discover our Revenue Sharing Token Ecosystem! (RST) A real world product(FCFpay) that keeps fueling our investor token $FCF!

$FCFpay integrates with the two biggest e-commerce platforms – WooCommerce & Shopify. But FCFpay doesn’t stop there… The flexible API allows it to be integrated into practically any existing payment system, even in physical retail stores! In fact, a large proportion of the first merchants to use it will be physical stores.

Imagine paying directly with crypto! You can nowshop online or in person, and spend your crypto gains without having to send them to the bank or use a “crypto credit card” that is actually just swapping your crypto for fiat. Crypto is about to fulfill its true purpose as the CASH of the internet!

Fcfpay allow you to buy flowers with BNB and order food with Cardano (or any other crypto)... just about any combination you can imagine, and all without requiring you to use a traditional offramp, such as a centralized exchange.

This will allow FCF to unite the $4 trillion-dollar online shopping industry with the cryptocurrency world. This unification positions FCF to lead the way towards mass adoption and secures the future of FCF as an essential crypto technology!

That’s why their motto is “EMPOWERING CRYPTO”!

$FCF was already listed on 4 exchanges over a period of just 4 weeks! LBANK, HOTBIT, COINSBIT AND LATOKEN… and there are more to come!

The payment gateway will incentivize adoption by featuring a fee structure that is lower than PayPal and credit card processing companies.

Every payment gateway transaction will also induce a buy back and BURN mechanism in FCF, thereby increasing the value of your FCF by reducing the overall supply!

$FCF rewards holders with BNB dividends based on trading volume (5% of each transaction goes to the dividend pool and is distributed proportionally) AND from a portion of transaction fees once

FCFpay is launched. Yes, you will earn dividends on every payment gateway transaction! This safeguards your investment from bear markets by establishing a second source of dividend revenue! Imagine receiving a portion of the $4 trillion-dollar e-commerce industry simply by holding FCF!

Become an FCF affiliate! Earn a stream of income of 0.1% off every transaction processed through FCFpay for 3 years upon having a merchant implementing FCFpay with your affiliate link!

Refer your friends and family to purchase $FCF token with transactions over 1500$ and earn 1.5% of the transaction as a commission and have the new investor get a 3% refund!

Register for your affiliate ID code here: [https://affiliates.frenchconnection.finance/?RefID=MQU8Wm](https://affiliates.frenchconnection.finance/?RefID=MQU8Wm)

As a great cherry on the cake, FCF is launching its 2nd platform on the ecosystem! FCFPoker, Web3 poker that integrates NFTs and support cryptocurrency payments in exchange of pokerchips. The revenue will be sent in the ecosystem like all the other platforms!

The Dev is always active and always OVERDELIVERS.

Dev is Doxxed, KYCd and a Certik audited!

Right my fellow apes! 🦍 A week ago I brought you Carillonium (Carom) if you bought that and held, you're now rich and going to get richer (check my post history for proof.) Now let me bring you another rocket ship (a literal ship) to the next destination!

The shitcoin/memecoin selection is ever-growing, each one offering less than the last. I've stumbled across a coin I'm satisfied to diamond hand and keep my investment in for both short-term AND long-term gain.

Let me introduce $MOONPIRATE. ☠️ By far the best community, the best use case, and the fastest I've ever seen a coin take off. They hit something like 25,000 holders in about four days. That makes safemoon look like a failure!

Without further ado:

☠️ MOONPIRATE - The first and only cryptocurrency to offer market and sell RUM* ☠️

*Yes this is LEGIT. They're in advanced talks with a distillery in California to start shipping Moonpirate rum: https://twitter.com/MoonpirateBSC/status/1384125713238818820

PROS:

Massive Telegram where everyone talks like pirates (win????????) 💣
Undoubtedly the best branding I've ever seen for a coin ☠️
Dev is based and has worked on awesome projects before (x1800, x2000)💣
Fastest growing community I've ever seen
Got rappers like Fat Joe on board to promote the coin☠️
Blockfolio & Coingecko listings coming very soon so expect a ridiculous PUMP💣💣💣💣

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,"MetFX – Constant giveaways! | Now is your chance to get into Metaverse early! | | First round of seed sale complete, many more to come | NFT platform out in less than a month | Team of 22 people | Approximate launch – first week of April","🔥Now is your chance to get into the Metaverse! Be part of this amazing project as it prepares to launch its amazing ecosystem full of incredible assets and zones to explore! 🔥

**Join the community of this amazing project to stay up to date with the latest news:**

[https://t.me/MetFXWORLD](https://t.me/MetFXWORLD)

**🚨 Important information about the future of the project:** **🚨**

🌟Finished first seed round. Many different more to come. Approximate launch – end of March, beginning of April. Suspect to change.

🌟Huge buzz is growing and now is the chance to get into Metaverse early!

🌟Fully working demo in a few weeks available for all to see.

🌟NFT platform out in less than a month

🌟Metaverse will be available on – Web 3 (PC), phones, VR devices such as Occulus

🌟Option for selling and buying of digital land

👉 **What is MetFX exactly? Fasten your seatbelts – it’s quite a project!**

In MetFX, users enter a 3D space where they can get the full movie going experience from the comfort of home. They can attend public showings to see the latest films or buy real estate to build their own private screening rooms. And in the marketplace, they can find a look for the MetFX world that suits their personal style.

Users can join from any device – and behind the scenes it’s all supported by a reserve-backed currency (MetFX) that users can stake to earn while they watch. 

👉 **Enter the Metaverse – take your first steps into the MetFX world**.

Front and center on the platform is the MetFX World, a Metaverse where players can buy real estate, lease theatres and ultimately play games.   
 The MetFX world will be accessible at launch, with an NFT-themed city player can explore. And as the world expands – billboards, stadiums and racetracks will be added, keeping the experience fresh for all visitors and residents.

All land sales will be denominated in stablecoins ( e.g. USDT) to reduce price volatility of these long-term assets.

👉 **What is going to be included in the MetFX’s Metaverse project actually?**

🔥Real Estate – Crypto enthusiasts have shown a growing demand for Metaverse plots, and MetFX seeks to meet this demand through MetFX World’s own real estate market.

🔥Sports – MetFX will feature stadiums and fields where players can watch horse racing, soccer, tennis and other sports events right in the Metaverse.

🔥Parks – Players can develop their land into public or private parks and add trees, fountains, and more to get the aesthetic just right.

🔥Private Rooms – MetFX offers private rooms that players can build to host closed screenings from their personal collection.

👉 **Can you guide me what can be bought in their exclusive Marketplace?**

Users can choose from exclusive MetFX NFTs or buy NFTs and in-game assets from their favorite artists. From Avatars to automobiles there are plenty of accessories to collect. And a flat 12% fee on every sale is reinvested into developing new content for the users.

✅Avatars - A key draw of the Metaverse is the ability for users to choose a look that they feel best represent themselves. 

✅Automobiles – Much like Avatars, Automobiles are NFTs that correspond to a unique 3D vehicle in the Metaverse. Users can show-off when pulling up to the cinema, or let their friends pile in for a drive-in experience.

✅NFT Gallery – Assets from other platforms can be added to the gallery as well for users to display their full collection of NFTs on the ETH blockchain. And as with all NFTs, these can be bought and sold freely between users.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Get Your Early Position Now - Fair Launch - Long Term Project - 3700+ TG Members and not even launched! 1000x GEM - Doxxed Devs - No Loss Lottery - Lifetime Tickets - Referral Rewards - Staking - New Concept - No Launch Until Security Audits Are Done!," I have been exploring and evaluating the cryptocurrency world for quite some time now in the crypto community's interest and trying to bring the best and most trustable projects. I had a detailed look at [Amnext’s](https://amnext.io/) [docs](https://docs.amnext.io/) and thought of sharing my detailed review for the DeFi users.

The name Amnext suggests that you can be the next in line to **change your life.** I can say that it breathes life into an ecosystem that can change people’s lives.  
Amnext’s USP is its unique lottery, where **no one loses.** The **Lifetime Tickets do not expire**, and everyone has a chance to hit the jackpots.

***Here Are Some Key Points To Note:***

* Lifetime Tickets
* No-Loss Lottery
* Staking Protocol
* Rewards in AMC by depositing into Prize Pools
* Referral Rewards
* Fair Launch
* Will not launch until Security Audits are done
* Development Team can be checked on Linkedin/Twitter

***So, Why Should People Participate?***

1. The entire ecosystem has been built around making sure that you always have a chance to win. The positive features of the Amnext Dapp, as listed below, should encourage the investors to participate in the program.
2. Once you purchase a **Lifetime Ticket**, you enter into the lottery draw for life. This new **UNIQUE concept** of Lifetime Tickets generates the possibility of winning the draw every time the jackpot is generated.
3. For every dollar you deposit on **No-Loss Prize Pools**, you are entitled to win big prizes in form of BNB/CAKE/USDT/BUSD/VAI and earn passive interest of AMC tokens; even if you don’t win, you keep all your money and until you withdraw you are entitled to win!
4. The more the number of people you invite on the Lifetime Tickets Lottery, the more rewards in AMC you will achieve. However, there is a cap on the number of tickets you can get.

***Conclusion***

In my honest and humble opinion, Amnext have a lot of Potential, aside of most DeFi projects you can easily check the Team behind it and their Linkedin/Twitter. It could quickly create a massive market cap and do a **1000x gain** and continue grow in a long term run. For sure not another MEME COIN.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,$Upi 🐶 The hottest pet friendly project is here | CMC listed ✔ CoinGecko listed ✔ Actually Doxed Team - LinkedIn Profiles ✔ App is in AppStore and Google Play ✔ NFTs for your pets!,"Not saying I know anything but they have been teasing a major announcement on top of their already major celebrity power. Now is the time to get in and if you're reading this, consider yourself lucky AF. I know I'm personally sick of these ""first name and pic"" dox and ""website in development"" BS. Their entire team is actually doxed - here's CEO LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/karimquazzani/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karimquazzani/).

This is probably one of the most legit and underrated projects out there, but don't take my word for it - please DYOR and remember that this is not financial advice!

**Project Details**

$UPI aka Youpee is a crypto utility token from Pawtocol - $UPI was created as a way for animal’s in need to help themselves!

Pawtocol is a global online community of pet lovers who are disrupting the pet industry by leveraging blockchain technology while monetizing data about their pets.

Data is aggregated from IOT devices like our Blockchain Pet Tag, vets and more. Users maintain full control over the data about their pets.

**What we do -** *Working to create a better, safer pet industry*

1. Help a global community of pet parents collect and process data about their pet's well-being through the use of sensors and professionals to help prevent illness through tailored care and nutrition instructions.
2. Give users a Universal Pet Income (UPI Token AKA Youpee ) that compensates them for the value of the data they provide to the network. UPI can be exchanged for products and services on the platform.
3. Help eliminate predatory marketing practices while recommending medicines, foods, treats, and toys from providers proven to benefit pet well-being.

**How we do it**

*Rewarding Participation - We want to make sure everyone feels rewarded when using the Pawtocol app.*

* Userbase - With UPI and points for sharing data about their pets, shopping, reviewing products and more
* Businesses - By putting them in front of pet parents that our AI thinks would benefit from their product or service

*Artificial Intelligence - Bringing the world's most powerful technology to pet owners.*

* Health Tips - The AI is always analyzing trends, assessing risk and providing advice making your job as pet parent easier
* Recommendations - By analyzing relevant breed and location data the AI's suggestions get smarter as it gets to know your pet

*IoT Technology - Using IoT sensors and embedded tech to collect and share pet data*

* Blockchain Pet Tags - Your pet brings their data with them everywhere and it shares what you want people to know
* New Devices - With the ability to integrate 3rd party and official IoT devices, no pet data is out of reach

**Features**

* Virtual pet adoption - sponsor a pet from a shelter
* Animal NFTs - a marketplace dedicated to pets with a set amount proceeds donated to Animal Welfare Organizations
* Blockchain Pet Tags - connect a pet to the Blockchain with the app that also CREATES NFTs!
* Treat! Toys! Foot! - Pet’s can earn $UPI with the data they generate and for their own shopping!

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Who are the penguins behind this new crypto project?,"TipsyCoin is gaining some traction. It claims to be a coin that makes people happy and to be fair, drinking does make us forget our worries. I find it pretty funny that the project tells us not to buy too much or we will get drunk. I came to know of this project through Illiquid Capital. They have been promoting it quite strongly for some strange reason. 

I dug deeper and followed their social accounts – their Discord is quite active and I found a post stating that no launch date has been given as they are doing some beta testing and will be having an audit. They said that $tipsy will be available in the first quarter of next year on Pancakeswap. Hopefully, when I can finally get my hands on this coin, I will also have access to their hangover-cure NFTs haha. 

Apparently if I were to own some $tipsy, I would get more $tipsy overtime. What’s interesting about this though is that they do not mint new coins but rather these rewards come from a sell tax (which they call ‘alcohol tax’). While a part of the sell taxes go towards holders as rewards, another part is used for buying up and burning $tipsy. The cool thing is that there is no buy tax, and I also like that their coins have a max supply because I am tired of speculating on the US dollar. 

Many projects look promising but then they end up doing a rug pull. So it’s great that the team is transparent about their allocation, and their equity is vested over 12 months. Their liquidity pool is locked for 5 years which is basically forever in crypto terms. What I appreciate most is their generosity. They had a Twitter endorsement from a Danish humanitarian called Anja Ringgren Lovén who made headlines years ago when she was saving a starving African child. TipsyCoin has supported Anja’s projects and they seem to have some history of working with Pfizer to save children from pneumonia. I will probably ape in with a few BNB and hopefully I get to win some USDT through their giveaways. My only concern is that the team behind TipsyCoin is anonymous. 

 What do you guys think?

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,$DOKY - a meme coin supported by Binance Top influencer - 4.3K+ Holders Right Now - Check Out Our Binance Article,"The world of cryptocurrency is full of meme coins, each trying to be the next big thing like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu or Pepe. But most of these coins are about dogs, cats, or frogs. 

While the market is flooded with dog, cat, and frog-themed coins, i found a one new entrant stands out for its distinctiveness and i do think this can be a next big meme coin if it catches some attention: The Donkey King, also known as 'Doky'. 

#Donkey king (Doky) is a Solana meme coin. Here’s why I am bullish on Doky meme coins:

**Uniqueness: A Refreshing Idea**

The first thing that got me interested in this meme coin is it's different from other meme coins. Wif , Pepe and other meme coins that made it to the top had one thing in common and that is all of these came up with a different meme idea. A copy pasted idea doesn't really last long in my opinion.

Donkeys are different and fun, making Doky stand out. People are always curious about new things, and a donkey coin is a fresh idea that can grab the  attention.

**Minimal Developer Involvement**

One of the most appealing aspects of Doky meme coin is the minimal involvement of developers in holding the coin’s supply. With most of the Doky supply held by the community and only 5% retained by the developer for project development, there's a reduced risk of large-scale sell-offs that can crash the coin’s value. 

This approach fosters trust and transparency, as the community knows that the developers are committed to the project’s growth rather than short-term gains.

**Doky MarketCap**

As per CoinMarketCap data Doky is currently sitting at $1.8 Million marketcap. 

If we compare it with the coins that made it to the top $1.8M marketcap is nothing. Pepe and Wif alone sitting at $6B and $3 billion marketcap. So the potential is huge if things start taking off and it takes no time for a meme coin. Most of you know that.

Meme Coins have so much potential and can make you life changing money if you get into it early and have a right choice.

# 💲DIVIDEND REWARDS

## 

**For every down there’s an UP!**

The biggest flaw in the dividend rewarding tokens are the contract sells. This is necessary for holders to get their rewards. The contract reserves taxed tokens and sells them to itself to get BNB. This  is needed to buy USDT which then get send to holders as dividend rewards. Those sells look bad on a chart and can even cause panic sells.

**FOMO; The Fear Of Missing Out.**

By implementing the rebase mechanic *(which was first introduced on the ethereum chain)* we can negate the contract sells and whale dumps. The value of your holdings won’t in  or decrease. But the chart will look better for new investors and create FOMO as it will only go UP!

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,📈 Baby Satoshi ($bSATOSHI) partners with Ethereum Vault ($eVAULT) | Passive Income Power Duo 🔝,"#What is Baby SatoshiINU: 

- Passive income is the only true way to build wealth, with Baby Satoshi on Uniswap, you can build your wealth with Bitcoin rewards sent to you automatically just for holding

- $bSATOSHI holders receive their share of 8% reflections from all transactions direct to their wallet as #Bitcoin. The rewards are paid out automatically and are proportional to the amount of tokens you own vs the total supply of coins. Just sit back, relax, and collect your passive gains!

- Reflection tokenomics are hot right now — but who really wants DOGE or SHIB?  Get BTC, the OG of crypto and the base reflection here to stay!

###Social links for Baby Satoshi Uni:

✅ Reddit: r/BabySatoshiUni

&nbsp;

####📍 Already listed on CoinGecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/babysatoshi


####📍 CoinMarketCap on the way 🚀

&nbsp;

Baby Satoshi has also partnered with Ethereum Vault $eVAULT to bring cross partner promotions, contests and co branded applications as milestones are hit. Lite Paper V1 has also been released.

&nbsp;
####Why and How did this partnership happen?

- Both projects ran into each other when a community member brought up the idea.  One project is an original USDC reflection token and the other ($bSATOSHI) is an original $wBTC reflection token.  As both were early to the space, it was genuinely fitting.  

- So what does this mean?

- Besides expanding both brands in cross community promotion, both tokens have agreed to developer an Apple/Google App that will track reflections for both as the first loaded tokens on “Ethereum Vault” app.  Within the app, “Satoshi Swap” will be integrated as well.  

- The team has agreed to launch this at a combined 1000 holders and so far, the community is excited for this approach.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,Introducing Bitcorn - The First and Only Solana DEX Token with Unique Potential,"Hello, fellow crypto enthusiasts. I am excited to share a fresh and innovative project that has recently entered the market: Bitcorn. This project is designed to stand out not only with its unique concept but also with its strong technical foundation and early-stage investment opportunity.

Why Bitcorn?

Bitcorn is a creative fusion of Bitcoin’s credibility and the charm of simplicity, represented by corn. While the concept is playful, the project itself is backed by a serious mission: to be the first and only token exclusively available on Solana DEX. This ensures high-speed transactions and low fees, leveraging Solana’s superior blockchain technology.

The project aims to create a sustainable and rewarding ecosystem for its holders, focusing on long-term growth rather than short-term hype. With a limited supply and a solid roadmap, Bitcorn is positioned to be a standout project in the competitive crypto market.

Key Features:

 • Built on Solana: Faster and cheaper transactions compared to many other blockchains.
 • First on Solana DEX: Bitcorn holds a unique place as the only token of its kind on this platform.
 • Community-Centric: The team is highly active and committed to building a loyal and informed community of investors.

Tokenomics and Launch Details:

Bitcorn has a total supply of [X] tokens, with fair distribution to ensure no whales dominate the market. The initial liquidity is locked, providing added security for early investors. With the project still in its early stages, this is an excellent opportunity to join before the broader market takes notice.

CA: F76Go1TqbZwnG17BhbQMovEJQHnmXuBBHAjGd3v1pump

How to Get Involved:

 • Website: https://bitcornsol.top/

 • Telegram:@ BitcornCTO

 • Twitter: https://x.com/BitcornCTO

If you are looking for a high-potential project on a fast and efficient blockchain like Solana, Bitcorn could be the perfect opportunity. As always, do your research and invest responsibly.",1101,2024-11-18 13:59:50,6

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,$BELLS: The True Origin of Memecoins Returns,"$BELLS – The First Memecoin Returns to the Spotlight

Contract: 0xBa2A3Dad197D6fee75471215eFD5C30c8C854e11

The history of memecoins is being rewritten. While many believe Dogecoin, launched in December 2013, was the first memecoin, the true pioneer of this movement is Bellscoin ($BELLS). Created by Billy Markus (@BillyM2k), the same developer behind Dogecoin, Bellscoin came into existence roughly 8 days prior to Dogecoin, making it the first-ever memecoin. In fact, Dogecoin itself is a fork of Bellscoin, marking $BELLS as the foundation from which the meme token revolution emerged. This long-forgotten origin has now been brought to light, as even Billy Markus confirmed in a recent post: BillyM2k confirmation.

Reviving Bellscoin’s Legacy on Ethereum
For nearly a decade, $BELLS remained overshadowed by Dogecoin’s rise to global fame. However, the memecoin that started it all is now poised for a resurgence. The revival of $BELLS on the Ethereum blockchain signifies a new beginning for the project, promising to reclaim its place as the true originator of the memecoin movement. As Dogecoin led the charge in popularizing dog-themed tokens, $BELLS is set to reignite the excitement for memecoins, this time with renewed purpose and a historic legacy to back it.

The Potential for $BELLS
With the spotlight returning to its roots, $BELLS holds immense potential to become the next big breakout in the memecoin space. Its historical significance, paired with the revival on Ethereum, positions $BELLS to capture the attention of both seasoned crypto investors and a new generation of enthusiasts. As it rides the wave of nostalgia and meme culture, $BELLS is poised to lead the next chapter in the memecoin revolution.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,🔥Insider Protocol - $IPRO | 🔥 ICO still at 3.5 USDT | Imperium blockchain based on the mimble wimble protocol testnet launch beginning of november (7.3 usdt/ipro after launch) | Set up for Binance Launchpad | Nice entry point for newcomers !,"The Mechanics of the Future team from the Insider Protocol project has been working on creating an anonymous and non-traceable cryptocurrency IPRO based on the MimbleWimble protocol, which should soon surpass the well-known Monero (XMR) and Dash. MimbleWimble is a protocol with wide scalability and increased privacy. It uses the technology of confidential transactions, encrypting all inputs and outputs, as well as their public and private keys. MimbleWimble also uses CoinJoin. The technology allows you to take payments from multiple senders and combine them into a single transaction, which makes it impossible to determine for a third party which recipient of the payment was intended.

''After years of hard-working finally, we are ready to launch the TESTNET of our MW-based blockchain within several months for public testing. Untraceable transactions and hidden wallet data are coming soon!''

In the first iteration, over 30 cryptocurrencies will already be available, including the IPRO itself and its derivatives in the form of DeFi.

By default, all transactions will be private with the ability to send comments to the transfer while hiding the sender's address.

**TESTNET** 

IMPERIUM launch, Fastest transaction speed (faster than Solana protocol). There is almost no commission, they are so small that you won't notice them. The ability to get and send private cryptocurrencies. Protection from spam attacks on the blockchain while maintaining minimal transaction fees.

One of the unique features will be that users will be able to not only create their own DeFi apps but also deploy them on their own. From our side, there will be smooth and seamless integration with our ecosystem, IPRO based finance, wallets, etc. Users will be able to create their own financial products in the form of lending, stable coins, pools and provide access to them to other users.

Atomic swaps with a bond against ETH, USDT, USDC, WBTC, and DAI. The ability to create a global account for users (optional). At the moment, several startups of the gaming industry, based on cryptocurrency, are already taking part in testing and development.

**Stable coin**

We are planning to launch our own stable coin with the support of our insurance fund and hedge fund partners.

**Binance partnership**

Besides going to Binance. Launchpad we are also going to integrate part of our ecosystem with the Binance Smart Chain

**VPN**

Wormhole VPN protocol (working title) will also be implemented for modules of the entire ecosystem. In case of blocking and the impossibility of working of the project nodes due to the negative and stupid policy of any country in relation to cryptocurrencies and the inclusion of locks at the state levels, in response, an automatic bypass of such locks through the darknet nodes will be included.

**Blockchain Documentation and Validator nodes**

On the launch day of the MW-based blockchain, the full documentation of the project will be available for third-party devs. The information will be especially interesting for those who decide to use our ecosystem to launch their own apps.

We are also working on the validator nodes and the definition of holders' rewards of our main asset IPRO. The information will be available on the 2nd Stage.

**Blockchain and wallet features on mainnet**

\- Atomic Swaps

\- DAPP

\- DAO Governance

\- connection of BTC, ETH, LTC, DASH, XMR, QTUM, and many other networks for swaps

\- multi language interface

\- desktop and mobile wallets (macOS, Windows, Linux)

\- browser extension version like MetaMask

\- more details will be revealed after the testnet launch

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,"MetFX – Experience the Metaverse! | First round of seed sale complete, many more to come | NFT platform out in less than a month | Fully working demo in a few weeks | Team of 22 people | Constant giveaways | Approximate launch – first week of April","💎Look what I found – it seems to me like the most awesome Metaverse project to anticipate for 2022! It has everything what a Metaverse participant and an investor would want! Check it out! 💎

**Join the community of this amazing project to stay up to date with the latest news:**

[https://t.me/MetFXWORLD](https://t.me/MetFXWORLD)

**🚨 Important information about the future of the project:** **🚨**

🌟Finished first seed round. Many different more to come. Approximate launch –  end of March, beginning of April. Suspect to change.

🌟Fully working demo in a few weeks available for all to see.

🌟NFT platform out in less than a month

🌟Metaverse will be available on – Web 3 (PC), phones, VR devices such as Occulus

🌟Option for selling and buying of digital land

👉 **What is MetFX exactly? Fasten your seatbelts – it’s quite a project!**

In MetFX, users enter a 3D space where they can get the full movie going experience from the comfort of home. They can attend public showings to see the latest films or buy real estate to build their own private screening rooms. And in the marketplace, they can find a look for the MetFX world that suits their personal style.

Users can join from any device – and behind the scenes it’s all supported by a reserve-backed currency (MetFX) that users can stake to earn while they watch. 

👉 **Enter the Metaverse – take your first steps into the MetFX world**.

Front and center on the platform is the MetFX World, a Metaverse where players can buy real estate, lease theatres and ultimately play games.   
 The MetFX world will be accessible at launch, with an NFT-themed city player can explore. And as the world expands – billboards, stadiums and racetracks will be added, keeping the experience fresh for all visitors and residents.

All land sales will be denominated in stablecoins ( e.g. USDT) to reduce price volatility of these long-term assets.

👉 **What is going to be included in the MetFX’s Metaverse project actually?**

🔥Real Estate – Crypto enthusiasts have shown a growing demand for Metaverse plots, and MetFX seeks to meet this demand through MetFX World’s own real estate market.

🔥Sports – MetFX will feature stadiums and fields where players can watch horse racing, soccer, tennis and other sports events right in the Metaverse.

🔥Parks – Players can develop their land into public or private parks and add trees, fountains, and more to get the aesthetic just right.

🔥Private Rooms – MetFX offers private rooms that players can build to host closed screenings from their personal collection.

👉 **Can you guide me what can be bought in their exclusive Marketplace?**

Users can choose from exclusive MetFX NFTs or buy NFTs and in-game assets from their favorite artists. From Avatars to automobiles there are plenty of accessories to collect. And a flat 12% fee on every sale is reinvested into developing new content for the users.

✅Avatars - A key draw of the Metaverse is the ability for users to choose a look that they feel best represent themselves. 

✅Automobiles – Much like Avatars, Automobiles are NFTs that correspond to a unique 3D vehicle in the Metaverse. Users can show-off when pulling up to the cinema, or let their friends pile in for a drive-in experience.

✅NFT Gallery – Assets from other platforms can be added to the gallery as well for users to display their full collection of NFTs on the ETH blockchain. And as with all NFTs, these can be bought and sold freely between users.

# FUTURE

# Locker of Anake

The locker of Anake will allow teams to lock the liquidity raised from their IDO in an innovative, safe, and transparent way.

Instead of simply locking the liquidity through a classic smart contract, the Locker of Anake will store and lock the liquidity within an ERC721 token (NFT), allowing his owner to move it from a wallet to another and always keeping the unlock schedule.

Not only this, but the Locker of Anake will allow projects to split the locked liquidity into multiple NFTs held by different team members. That feature is not only convenient for teams so they can share the liquidity's responsibility in case of a wallet loss/hack but also very convenient for investors who always fear the moment the liquidity unlocks. Indeed, having the liquidity split assures investors that one single person cannot rugpull an entire project.

Moreover, if the project is transferred to a new team, the previous liquidity owner(s) can sell the liquidity to the new team.

The wheel of Kronos allows a project to vest tokens for teams, influencers, or anyone of their choosing to have them automatically locked and doled out based upon a pre-defined time frame.

Same as the Locker of Anake, the Wheel of Kronos will store and vest the specific tokens within an ERC721 token (NFT). That way, team members/influencers can transfer their vested tokens from a wallet to another and or even split them into multiple wallets.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,$Nitefeeder is the Only Matt Furie Coin to Hit $17m Without any CEX yet. Let that Sink In.,"I was away from Reddit due to vacation and wedding planning, but I am BACK and will be making regular viral Reddit posts again. It was unfortunate timing with the overall market taking an absolute beating, but it is what it is. The mission to $100M+ market cap for Nitefeeder continues.

For those who don't know me, I've pushed numerous projects to $100M+. Many have seen 100x+, many 50x+ returns, and so on. It's all been documented on my [Twitter](https://x.com/Cryptovechkin) and TG. Nitefeeder WILL be next.

In fact, if you've followed along the Nitefeeder journey, you'd know just how impactful my Reddit posts have been. My last [9 Reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nitefeeder/comments/1d7m0fz/nitefeeder_reddit_archives/) and their effect on Nitefeeder price action, for example:

1. 40% pump
2. 60% pump
3. 170% pump
4. 40% pump
5. 48% pump
6. 50% pump
7. 45% pump
8. -5% drop (I blame the overall market for this one 🤣)
9. 40% pump

I've also donated $50k+ to the project so you can bet your ass I'll be here long term. In total, the community and whales have donated $400k+ to the multisig marketing wallet and we'll continue to donate.

# Overall Market Sentiment

The overall market is currently in [extreme fear](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/), which, in my 9 years of crypto experience, has always been the absolute best time to buy in. ""Buy when people are fearful, sell when people are greedy"" is a motto to live by, especially in the crypto world.

The last time Bitcoin dumped to $50K, Nitefeeder was at just a $1.7M market cap. This time, Nitefeeder is hovering between $4-5M. In this sense, Nitefeeder is holding quite well relative to the rest of the market. Just wait until BTC finally breaks out of its $50-70k range and sends to new heights. What do you think would happen to Nitefeeder then?

# Future Plans

Nitefeeder hit a **$17M market cap all-time** high without a single CEX listing. You can't say that about ANY other Matt Furie coin. In fact, I would go as far as to say that you can't find that for any other ""memecoin"" in general. We know how to use funds and we know how to time the market. The CTO team consists of multiple people who have pushed numerous projects to $100M+. We are not messing around.

Our plan is to be listed on a CEX as soon as possible without using any Nitefeeder tokens in the deal. This is because CEXs would just dump the tokens you give them directly on the market. Instead, we will be using ETH and USDT in the deal so that the listing only benefits us.

We also have two casino games to be launched as soon as audits on the contracts are complete. We have hired a professional content team to bust out memes daily. They are the same team behind Mumu's run-up to $200M+.

The highly anticipated P2P game is coming together very nicely and is still planned for an early Q4 launch. Teasers and trailers will be released well before then. This is a coin where you can just buy a bag and come back to it in a few months, and I guarantee you won't regret your decision.

# Summary for the Newcomers

In 2004 Matt Furie made his [first drawing of Nitefeeder](https://web.archive.org/web/20041015182817/http://www.mattfurie.com/out.php?id=3). This was a **year before** he first drew Pepe and **two years before** he created The Boys Club comic. Nitefeeder is the [ONLY character](https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1dv93m2/nitefeeder_is_the_only_character_in_both_matt/) in both of Matt Furie's comics The Boys Club and The Night Riders. Being Pepe's pet in the Boys Club comic, Nitefeeder fits many of the popular narratives including pets, birds, Boys Club and the Night Riders.

Throw in gaming and gambling, and you have a **bluechip** memecoin in the making. Nitefeeder is a $50m+ market cap memecoin disguised as just $5m. There’s a reason why $Kendu, $Hoppy, and $Wojak [millionaires have been investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1dxoy4i/nitefeeder_pumps_3x_as_wojak_and_hoppy/). It doesn’t take a genius to see how undervalued Nitefeeder is.

**What are Tokenized Stocks?**

Tokenized stocks are tokenized derivatives that represent traditional securities, particularly shares in publicly listed companies traded on regulated exchanges such as Scotts Miracle-Gro, Curaleaf, Aurora, Apple, Tesla and others.

The key benefits of tokenized stocks include fractional ownership of traditional securities, 24/7 access to markets, and greater liquidity to name a few. These digital assets are backed 1:1 by traditional stocks, entitling holders to the same economic benefits of owning the underlying stock.

RastaSwap has been developed to be the #1 AMM Decentralized Exchange for Tokenized Cannabis stocks, and a bridge between the traditional stock market and crypto market, making it easier to invest in cannabis stocks and assets placed in different countries at the same time from anywhere in the world.

**What is Decentralized Exchange (DEX)?**

A decentralized exchange (or DEX) is a peer-to-peer marketplace where transactions occur directly between crypto traders. DEXs fulfill one of crypto’s core possibilities: fostering financial transactions that aren’t officiated by banks, while brokers running on blockchain with public registry of operations, handle all interactions automatically through Smart Contracts. There are Many popular DEXs, like PancakeSwap, Uniswap and Sushiswap.

**What is AMM?**

AMMs systems took off after they were first implemented by Shearson Lehman Brothers and ATD in the early 1990s.

In crypto, AMM is being used for the most important existing decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap and it allows digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way, by using liquidity pools rather than a traditional market of buyers and sellers. Prices are determined by a constant mathematical formula.

Liquidity pools can be optimized for different purposes and are proving to be an important instrument in the DeFi ecosystem

RastaSwap it’s a AMM Decentralized Exchange community owned, which means that all liquidity pools are managed and owned by the community sharing the profit from all transactions on the exchange.

**Passive Income**

RastaSwap is a community owned and driven project. All Profit-sharing from all liquidity pools and transactions fees on the exchange are distributed to RastaCoin ($RCOIN) holders, everyday at 4:20 PM in form of $ETH, $BNB or $CAKE automatically deposited to your wallet . The tech behind this project will be managing the pools and farms so users can sit back, relax, and receive their profits automatically deposited in their Wallet.

**A Secure Platform to Trade and Launch 4:20 Friendly Tokens**

Our goal is to create a platform where any cannabis initiative can receive funds with RastaSwap. This can include startup projects or already established cannabis businesses. They will be able to issue tokens backed in real stocks or assets.

**RastaCoin - $RCOIN Token Details**

$RCOIN is the governance token of the RastaSwap project and it's mandatory to participate on voting and funding. When a new token is offered on market, having $RCOIN will be necessary in order to participate and the $RCOIN used will be burned to reduce the token supply.

**Ticker:** $RCOIN

**Token Specification:** BEP-20 / ERC-20

Diverse in Nature, Chiba Inu offers investors many things that are often overlooked or oversold.

We've taken careful measure to ensure that our Team is transparent and communicates clearly with our community.

Be it new or experienced traders, Chiba Inu aims to create an atmosphere easily digested by all. We are one.

Our telegram hosts 'Daily Voice chats' in which investors can interact with the team; making suggestions and requests.

We believe in transparency and honesty; which is why we warn our investors prior to all pumps and sell offs (within our knowledge).

ChibaInu's Social media platforms are managed by active moderator members of the community; there is constant interaction between marketing and investors.

Once finalized, our Team will release our prized creation; ChibaSwap (our Native Non-profit Dececntrilized Trading Platform)

Taxes associated to ChibaSwap will be allocated accordingly to Breast & Prostate Cancer Research Charities.

We encourage safe trading and healthy lifesyle choices, we'd like to inspire others to adopt similar natures.

It is our aim and practice to provide the best trading experience we can to new and existing users.

We will continue to burn LP tokens and add liquidity to our LP's, including USDT and BUSD pools.

In the future, ChibaInu intends on offering our investors more, including but not limited to Staking and Farming protocols.

We offer a truly mixed set of tools between our core members; Team discussions about improvements and integrations are held daily.

Having set our minds to fulfilling the needs and requests of our community, there is high likelihood that we will explore NFT's in time.

ChibaInu has been generous to founding investors; holding regular giveaways withing our Telegram community.

This is but an example of what can expect and look forward to when joining the ChibaInu revolution.

We are here for one reason; to create a more safe and enjoyable user experience to help raise worldwide Crypo Adoption.

It would for the benefit of the entire Blockchain Community that more projects like ChibaInu meet the criteria of today's investor.

Safe, fun and beneficial to society in a way that offers others a better chance at life; without investing directly in Cryptocurrency.

Thank you for choosing Team Chiba, you're in good hands.

USDT,CryptoMoonShots,💲DollarUp 🔥|Brand New Rebase Token with USDT rewards| Dev Based| The Chart is Always Going Up🚀 💹 Just Launched! 💹 |,"&#x200B;

# What is DollarUp $DUP? 

&#x200B;

DollarUp is the next generation of rebase tokens, meaning that the code is completely unique, and brings many improvements to some rebase tokens! So far, rebase tokens came with just green chart but this contract promises green bills for holding as well !! That's right - USDT rewards !!

&#x200B;

Missed OnlyUp? Well you've got the chance to get in early in a token that uses the same concept but the contract has been improved to keep the hype going forever ! Real 1000x potential ! 🚀

&#x200B;

**Contract:** 0xf10a6cF35010617aE7B608a18545EA0036157AaA 

&#x200B;

**What is a Rebase?**

&#x200B;

A price-elastic token, or a rebase token, is one where the project’s total token supply is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts on a routine basis.

&#x200B;

These token supply adjustments, called “rebases,” take place per market demand and are done in such a way that users’ proportional holdings ultimately don’t change and thus aren’t diluted. Rebases are performed per a specific target price, with the idea being that a token’s nominal price will steadily be moved over time toward its target, in our case, toward the price of USDT!

&#x200B;

**Do I lose/gain money when a positive/negative rebase happens?**

&#x200B;

No, the amount of tokens is not representative of the value you are holding within rebase token projects. Because the rebasing happens to the total supply of tokens in circulation the value of your holdings stay the same after a positive or negative rebase happens

&#x200B;

**Why REBASE + REWARDS ?**

&#x200B;

The biggest flaw in the dividend rewarding tokens are the contract sells. This is necessary for holders to get their rewards. The contract reserves taxed tokens and sells them to itself to get BNB. This is needed to buy USDT which then get send to holders as dividend rewards. Those sells look bad on a chart and can even cause panic sells. Once the chart becomes too red, we can rebase and the chart becomes all green. It gives a psychological advantage to the holders.

USDT,Altcoin,I want to share 1 tip so you can see the dip coming.,"First off, I should preface this with a little bit about me. Been around btc since 2012 and holding since.  I dabble in alts that I believe in. Good team / clear white paper and a solid value prop. I will never pump a coin just to pump, but I will dump a coin/token if I lose faith in the alt team or I don't like what's coming out of their camp. I'm pretty good at seeing through people.  If I bring up a coin it will come with sound reasoning. Moving on... getting to my tip.  

I believe everyone knows that BTC whales control the altcoin market. They have so much buying-power it’s insane. Many belong and participate in ‘whale rings’ and these rings purchase specific coins together and because they are using what is essentially all profit from mining or purchasing early BTC they can buy massive amounts of altcoins, pump the volume and price up substantially. This is one reason why things are volatile and will always be. Crypto wealth is extremely disproportional.  Dips happen often because if you buy a lot of coins for little money, you can make massive gains on a slight uptick and shortly after the whales are dumping. It's all strategic. Speculators tend to attribute dips to nonsense. From country or bank banning crypto or whatever. This type of BS is not the reason things go red. The reality is that whales influence the direction of the market. Call it what you want. This is how I see it. 

A lot of people ask me about timing/dips. Obviously, I don’t have all the answers but I’m pretty good at spotting where things are heading over a 24-72 hour period. It's not rocket science. Pattern recognition is pretty easy if you understand the order books and depth charts. But a really good indicator of a market shift or whale ring movement is putting USDT on your favorite list and watch it. When a dip is coming and things are going from green to red, give USDT a look (on the exchange you trade on not just CMC) and if it’s 1:02-1.03+ this means whales are using USDT as a bridge before they crash the market for the little guys. If you spot 1.03 you can be sure the whales are dumping the altcoin and putting their short-term gains and profits into USDT until the cycle starts again. If you review the USDT historical charts you will see high volume at these price points. USDT is a good utility to maintain gains if used properly. Generally speaking, whales tend not to go from altcoin to bitcoin when they know everything is about to dip because again, they control the market. Whales often swim together (pod, gam, school etc whatever you want to call it) and they pull out ( go their own way) at different times typically 12-24 hour periods because this is global and people sleep while others are up. 

USDT is a misunderstood coin. It’s a tool, a bridge, a vehicle... Not an ""investment."" Put it on your tracker and keep your eye on it when refreshing your alt portfolio. 

Hope this helps. If it doesn’t - don’t use my tip. 

Edit: so my intention was to post this just before the dip started but the original post got deleted by the auto mod. It was manually published after I discussed the issue with the human mod. If you view this pic you will see a before and after of the dip. I think this makes my point... sorta.  https://m.imgur.com/a/KNVpI",413,2018-01-22 06:21:15,143

USDT,Altcoin,Best DePIN projects,"
With the next bull-run around the corner, I feel like DePIN (Decentralised Physical Infrastructure) will be the darling category. Every other category has the stigma of being magic internet money made up of only ones and zeros. But DePIN projects have physical, tangible assets that you can hold and point to as something that exists in the real world. DePIN will appeal to traditional stockmarket investors and act as the bridge between investing in real world assets and digital assets.



With that in mind, what’s your favourite DePIN project and if you could, please share info such as:


1. real-world problem it solves


2. the physical assets that exist


3. non-crypto partnerships (real-world companies that see value in crypto projects), and any other stats such as


4. buyback / burn details


5. number of users


6. market cap


7. token price


7. circulating supply etc.



My personal pick for top project is World Mobile Token


Real-World Problem: 40% of earth’s population still have ZERO internet access. Therefore, ZERO access to education, healthcare & financial services and limited access to a better life. Telecomms is a $3 Trillion industry. There are currently 1000 Mobile Network Operators servicing half the world. But they leave the rest of the world untouched because they have deemed it financially unviable to develop infrastructure in remote areas. World Mobile, however, have to team, the tech and the Sharing Economy Business Model (this part is key) to deliver twice the speeds at half the price. And before you say it, Starlink is not cheap and is internet only (see Elon’s most recent tweet about this), whereas World Mobile is more like a AT&T/Vodafone/T-Mobile type organisation. However, World Mobile does work with Starlink for their backhaul services. World Mobile plans to Connect the Unconnected (1 billion by 2030).

 

Physical Assets

Aerostat: Their biggest physical asset just launched in Mozambique (with many more in the pipeline). The World Mobile Aerostat is essentially a blimp that is tethered to the ground. It hovers at 300 metres and provides internet access to everyone within a 75km radius. Other physical assets include:
Air Nodes (many variations and sizes, but picture a box with an antenna connected to a pole with solar panels at the top and rechargeable batteries at the bottom),
Earth Nodes (computer that validates transactions on the blockchain) and

Users: 51,000
Average revenue per user: $1.50 per month in Africa, $55 per month in USA
Buyback: 18% revenue is used to buy WMT off exchanges every week  (most recently US$4,213 / 30,094 WMT)
Total buybacks since May 2023: 591,214 WMT = US$74,197 at current price of $0.1255

Forget 1 billion users by 2030. Imagine 1 million users. If US$4,357 is being bought weekly with only 57,000 users (at ARPU $1.50 per month, not the higher $55 in USA yet), we can extrapolate to 1 million users and expect US$76,000 per week being bought back. Imagine the buy pressure without even factoring investors. This is how we get mass adoption of crypto. Users using blockchain without knowing it.

They have recently announced they will consider Bitcoin, Tether, and Lugano’s LVGA tokens as legal currency within the city.

USDT,Altcoin,"Confirmed reversal indicator on the Daily Chart of TLOS ""Bag Some"" has Appeared after the Collaboration Announcement with GameStop!","2 days ago, GameStop made an exciting announcement that sent shockwaves through the crypto and gaming communities. The renowned retailer revealed its partnership with Telos Network, a prominent Layer-1 blockchain protocol that has now rebranded itself as ""Layer Zero"", (meaning on google: https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+layer-zero+blockchain&oq=what+is+layer-zero+blockchain&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30l3j0i390i650l3.9178j0j4&client=ms-android-xiaomi-rvo3&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8). This strategic collaboration marked an important milestone in GameStop's Web3 expansion strategy, generating significant interest and speculation among investors and enthusiasts alike.

Following the announcement ( https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/gamestop-teams-up-with-the-telos-foundation-to-grow-web3-gaming-strategy/ar-AA1bZRTG ), it became evident that this partnership had a direct impact on the price of the TLOS token, the native token of Telos Network. The chart displayed above clearly depicts a substantial price pump for the TLOS token, the market's enthusiastic response to the news. This surge in value demonstrated the market's anticipation and optimism surrounding the potential synergies between GameStop and Telos. Chart here: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/telos/

Given the notable price movement and the growing buzz surrounding this collaboration, many individuals have aped into this market. The term ""ape"" in this context refers to entering a market with significant enthusiasm and investment, often driven by FOMO (fear of missing out) and high-profit expectations.

Before deciding to explore this network and potentially invest in the TLOS token, it is crucial to assess the fundamental aspects of Telos. One of the key features highlighted by the network is its promising no-downtime characteristic. This means that the Telos blockchain aims to provide a highly reliable infrastructure, ensuring uninterrupted availability and functionality. Such a feature can be particularly appealing to users who value stability and reliability in a blockchain network.

Additionally, Telos claims to offer the almost-zero  transaction fees compared to other blockchain networks. Lower fees can be a significant advantage, as it enables users to conduct transactions more cost-effectively and facilitates broader adoption of the network. However, you still need to conduct thorough research and evaluate the network's fee structure in relation to its scalability, security, and overall performance to gain a comprehensive understanding of its competitiveness.

DYOR: A lot of hype has obviously been out by the latest deal between GameStop and Telos, but investors should proceed with caution and complete thorough due diligence before making any choices. Happy Trading 📈 🙂",21,2023-06-03 20:46:33,10

It is nearly just a year old with 5 out of 9 dApps released of its roadmap. It is a low cap worth $70M, so it could still be out-sourced by larger competitors in time. Additionally, the bear market has stagnated price growth; although its price has remained relatively stable for 5 months.

From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

**Market Overview**

September has been a pretty negative month with the overall market seeing its value decline by 7%. The fear and greed index slipped back into extreme fear and now sits at fear. However there are reasons to be positive. Firstly the Chairman of the Fed, Jerome Powell, told congress he did not intend to ban crypto currency, although he said stablecoins needed greater regulatory oversight. Secondly, the massive recent negativity surrounding China’s ban on crypto looks to have been overdone as usual. It is evident that the Chinese crypto enthusiast has no intention of letting the crypto revolution pass him by. It appears as though they have started trading through DEX’s as witnessed by the surge in trade on Dydx. Finally the Chair of the SEC said that he supported a bitcoin ETF, another positive step forward for the industry. So all in all a positive week.

**Trending**

**Regulators target DeFi**

The SEC is investigating Uniswap Labs, the organization behind the leading DEX Uniswap. It is early days yet but is a sign of things to come. That news was followed by the announcement that New Jersey had served a cease and desist order on Celsius, a leading yield farming platform which advertises, ‘earn 17% yield on your crypto’. Alabama and Texas are also looking at doing the same. Both Celsius and Uniswap rolled out the same statement that they are willing to work with regulators. Finally, Coinbase was told in no uncertain terms that if they continued with their plans to launch a lending platform the SEC would sue. Whilst Coinbase continued to deny that lending represented a regulated activity, they had no choice but to shelve or bin their proposals.

Check out our [Staking and Yield Farming Review](https://medium.com/the-capital/weekly-staking-and-yield-farming-review-23rd-september-2021-6904585050c4) which sets out our thinking on these regulatory actions and what strategy investors should follow.

**The UK’s Post Office enters crypto**

Yes you heard it right! The Post Office announced that its app can be used to connect to a decentralized exchange called Swarm Markets, from there vouchers can be purchased that are redeemable for crypto. British politicians were up in arms about the announcement. The fully diluted market cap of Swarm is a modest $70 million, could be worth a closer look assuming the unhappy politicians don’t get their way.

**That old chestnut - China**

The recent stumble in the crypto market was blamed on China’s now outright ban of crypto no doubt to protect it’s digital yuan which it is rolling out. This should be no surprise. China has been tough on crypto for some time, the only surprise is this didn't happen sooner. Crypto will do just fine without China.

**Binance again**

Every month there is never any shortage of negative stories to write about when it comes to Binance’s trials and tribulations. This month saw the announcement that both the IRS and the DOJ are investigating. It is reported that this is for market manipulation and insider trading. Binance also announced it was withdrawing from yet another market, Singapore. We do hope that investors who use Binance’s central wallet have started to move their crypto into their own wallet.

**Robinhood and PayPal**

Robinhood announced that they were rolling out a crypto wallet with transfer features allowing customers to store crypto and move in and out of their apps. The market considers Robinhood a serious threat to Coinbase’s business with this move. Meanwhile back in the grey and damp UK PayPal announced they were introducing crypto trading services through their PayPal accounts. Of course there is a limited selection of coins available including the Bitcoin fork Bitcoin Cash valued at a ridiculous $10 billion.

**Cardano introducing its own stablecoin**

September saw the launch of the much anticipated and long overdue smart contract functionality on the Cardano blockchain. Named the Djed, it is an algorithmic stablecoin as compared to one backed by fiat. Its new stable coin is expected to make transaction costs on the Cardano network cheaper and more predictable. Its announcement comes at a time when US regulators are considering regulating or banning stablecoins.

**Finally…**

There is talk that the SEC is investigating Tether, the leading stablecoin player. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone following the shenanigans at Tether over their total lack of transparency since inception. There have been multiple reports of investigations into breaching banking and security laws.

Of course I know I wont be able to time the peak of the next potential bullrun, but thats a whole other subject. Up until now I have been using tether, but with everything going on I wont be doing that in the future. And we all know that eth and btc can fluctuate as well as altcoins, so Im not really sure of that option either. That leaves the option of cashing out - I have never done that before because of the tether option, but it seems the fees for this are quite high if using coinbase. So please, share your strategies for keeping your funds ""safe"" when you think a bullrun is comming to the end. How do you typically cash out?

From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

**Market Overview**

The crypto market continues its new bull run, which re-commenced in July, hitting a new high of $2.7 trillion. Both Bitcoin and Ether also reached all time highs in October. Binance Coin, Tether and Cardano make up the top five by market cap. The Fear and Greed index currently sits at ‘Greed’, which compares to last week’s ‘Extreme Greed’ and last month’s neutral.

**Trending**

**SEC Approves Bitcoin Futures ETF**

After years of false starts the crypto industry finally got its ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). The SEC approved the ProShare Bitcoin Strategy ETF. After two days on the NYSE ProShare’s ETF became the fastest fund ever to reach $1 billion in assets under management. Physically based bitcoin ETFs, where you invest directly in bitcoin, are still waiting approval, but it is a promising start.

**SEC Chairman claims U.S won’t ban crypto**

It came as a relief to the market when Gensler the Chairman of the SEC declared that the U.S would not ban crypto but would seek to better regulate it. Although the final decision would be up to Congress. That regulation is most likely to be focused on the stablecoin market to begin with.

**Walmart enters crypto**

Walmart shoppers can now buy bitcoin at 200 kiosks in its stores. The test is with Coinstar which offers bitcoin at more than 3,000 kiosks.

**Axie Infinity creator raises $152 million**

Axie Infinity is one of the most popular play-ro-earn games on the blockchain commanding a $38 billion valuation (fully diluted). An Investment in the creator rather than the tokens is a telling sign that the tokens do not represent good value. Avoid for now.

**Memecoin mania**

Shiba Inu, the memcoin named after another dog, saw its token rocket in value before falling back after a comment from Musk that he didn't own any. But that comment didn't stop its rise and it is now valued above Dogecoin at $38 billion. Of course that has reignited the search for the next Doge or Shiba, a search we won't be embarking on.

**Squid Games pump and dump**

A token inspired by the Netflix show Squid Games saw its price spiral upwards by 380,000% on its debut. That upwards momentum continued as the price hit $2,861. However the price came crashing down as the founders cashed out with a $12 million profit and left the ‘project’. That my friends is the danger of investing in memecoins and projects with no fundamentals.

**NFT mania**

Coinbase announced it was launching an NFT marketplace focusing initially on Ethereum based NFTs.

**The good and bad of Robinhood**

Robinhood’s announcement that it was launching a crypto wallet hit the share price of Coinbase particularly after they revealed they had already signed up 1 million people to the upcoming product. However Robinhood suffered its own set back a few days later when it reported its quarterly earnings. The main cause of concern was the fall off in crypto trading from $233 million in the previous quarter to $51 million in the current. The shares tanked.

**USDC finds itself under investigation**

One of the leading stable coins, number two behind Tether, was issued with a subpoena from the SEC back in July, only recently coming to light however. It was also disclosed that the investigation continues. USDC announced it was shifting its reserves to only cash and treasuries. It is expected that the SEC will oversee the stablecoin market in the short term, something which will no doubt send shivers up the spine of Tether.

**Tether’s house of cards**

Last month we reported that the SEC is investigating Tether. This month they were hit with a $42.5 million fine by the CFTC. It was also reported in a Bloomberg expose that billions of dollars of client money has been invested in risky crypto projects, something the team at Tether initially denied but was later confirmed by Celsius who benefited from an investment of $1 billion. This is a devastating revelation and is a sure sign that if there was ever a bank run investors would suffer massive losses.

**New York targets DeFi Lending**

Both Nexus and Celsius received cease and desist letters from the New York Attorney General. Nexus and Celsius are lending platforms targeting private investors.

**Finally...**

A new survey suggests 11.4% of adults around the world own crypto. Nigeria, Malaysia and Australia have the highest rate of adoption. Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Philippines, Mexico and the US make up the top 10.

USDT,Altcoin,What Is IOTA And Should You Invest?,,51,2017-12-17 21:06:06,14
USDT,Altcoin,Shyft network sub 20million gem,"Hi guys my friend researched a project called $Shyft network.

The project derives its because of the shyft we are seeing within the blockchain space and how crypto is going mainstream, with this coming significant regulations. 

Shyft developed in from 2017 has only launched in the current year 2021. A project under development for 4 years and has 1 product out which is being used and integrated. 

This product is veriscope.

Then problem we are facing is the fact that aml/kyc procedures are becoming forced upon the digital asset space. As a result digital IDs are necessary to get into a polkastarter Sale, paid sale or even duckstarter sale. To use exchanges we all need to perform kyc. This is what Shyfts first product entails. It is adopted by the likes of binance, tether, bitfinex and other crypto exchanges. 

Simply put, if you signed up at binance and kycd and they are in the shyft network. Your data,  only by your consent can be leveraged to another exchange should you register , so instead of kucoin verifying your kyc, they leverage the shyft network to obtain your identity data, which complies to the fatf travel regulations which is being phased in, a review on compliance will be done in June 2021. So instead of binance and kucoin having to consistently spend resources kyc the same person twice, it's leveraged, as the network grows this will create massive savings. This is very much detailed in the article I have written which is also detailed in the whitepaper of shyft.

If this isn't big enough, the catalyst for the price is the mainnet,  shyft will move onto their mainnet soon, which is a fork of ethereum with slight extensions to ensure TX fees are low, whilst maintaining security and ensuring the blockchain is fast. 

In addition the team has partnership with the government of Bermuda,  this entails digital identification with potentially expanding this framework to offer financial services to individuals within Bermuda, essentially banking the unbanked or underbanked individuals. 

Lastly the team is public:
Advisors include:
Rick McDonnell and Josee Nadeau both individuals previously worked at fatf, which is imposing regulations, in addition to joining binance legal advisory team.

Peter Warrack: part of legal advisory for bitfinex

Anthony di Lorio: Co founder of ethereum.

This only has a market cap of sub 20 million and I advise everyone to do their own research.

USDT,Altcoin,Recent scams or suspect tokens,I hope too many people didn’t get caught up in that bitconnect mess! Now they say tether is suspect! It pays to do your research and not ride the hype train!!,12,2018-01-28 13:33:18,15
USDT,Altcoin,"Most talked about and upvoted cryptos in r/altcoin and r/cryptocurrency, week ending 2018-01-19","tl;dr: (skip to “Trending Cryptos”, esp. if you've already read the intro from my post last week)

**INTRO**

Like most of us here, I’ve been following the posts on this subreddit diligently, and have been able to make some good crypto investments from all the shilling, discussion, and even fud that happens here!

I don’t have enough time to read everything and constantly check the reddit app, but I still don’t want to miss out on opportunities that come from a crypto being talked a lot about on here.

So I developed a program for myself that collects data on the cryptos that are being talked about most (both in terms of number of posts, and total number of upvotes) on r/cryptocurrency and r/altcoin. I can quickly browse the headlines of the top posts it collects, as well as see at a glance which cryptos are “trending” or “buzzing” on the subreddits in the recent weeks. The program also pulls in Coinmarketcap API data, like current market cap and 7 day price change. Aggregating all this data automatically has saved me a lot of time and allowed me to focus my research efforts on the cryptos that I think could have the highest potential e.g. low market cap, recently “buzzing” cryptos on r/cryptocurrency and r/altcoin.

I’ve decided to share the outputs of my program, as well as some highlights I’ve written, here for the benefit of this subreddit (and may do so periodically). Let me know if you have any feedback, questions, or suggestions, always looking to improve and share more interesting data here!

**TRENDING CRYPTOS**

**Highlights:**

1. **BitConnect** lost almost all its value this past week, with a large increase in the number of posts, and the popularity of those posts, about it. BitConnect's increase in buzz is almost entirely attributable to the community pouncing on it for being a scam / pyramid scheme.
2. **COSS** and **Aigang** were lower market cap coins that fell in price, but experienced a modest increase in buzz. Some continue to remain optimistic about the prospects of COSS, and there have been several posts reviewing Aigang as more and more people learn about it.
3. **NEO** was the only coin to have an increase in price this past week. Buzz for NEO is still remaining steady, at the top of the list in terms of both post count and score/popularity.

(inf means infinity, which occurs when a number is divided by zero i.e. a week over week change number is calculated when the week before last week had a zero value)

USDT,Altcoin,"Most talked about and upvoted cryptos and altcoins on reddit, week ending 2018-02-03","What a roller coaster it’s been! Glad January is over.

I wanted to continue sharing something with this community that seems to be helpful, but please keep giving me feedback! 

I wrote a program that scrapes reddit posts from r/cryptocurrency and r/altcoin, and calculates how much certain cryptocurrencies are mentioned, to help give an early indication of the next potential 10x crypto. Ok fine 10x is _highly_ optimistic, but understanding crowd sentiment has proven to be a good place to start for more research. 

Here are some of the numbers for this week (if you prefer to follow along via email, [you can do so here](https://cryptomintclub.com)).

**Note**: *always* do your own research. Not all cryptos with a lot of mentions are being talked about good/positive reasons (e.g. BitConnect). Keep reading for info on getting a list of all recent posts so you can browse the headlines and gauge sentiment.

**RECENTLY TRENDING CRYPTOS**


**Highlights:**

1. **Nano** (formerly known as Raiblocks) saw a lot more discussion about it this week. Raiblocks rebranded to Nano, and got listed on Binance.

2. **OriginTrail** and **Blockport** were some lower market cap coins that have appeared on the top talked about cryptos list this week.

3. The community talked less about **BitConnect** and **VeChain** last week compared to the week before, as BitConnect being a scam is common knowledge now, and VeChain takes a small breather from its recent flurry of news.

USDT,Altcoin,Why Ripple Will Explode Soon!,,0,2018-02-01 12:07:40,10
USDT,Altcoin,Altcoins that pay dividends or that are backed by non-crypto assets-,"I am looking for altcoins to hedge against cryptocurrency market movements.

Coins that are linked to something non-crypto. Examples would be:

- Profitable service that pays out dividends
- Coins are ownership of assets  or at least partially backed by non-crypto-assets.
- Coins that are pegged to fiat currencies. precious metals etc.

Examples of coins:

Nubits
Tether
Xaurum
BitGold
Monkey Capital(??)

You get the idea.",2,2017-08-31 09:40:41,10
USDT,Altcoin,Who needs stablecoins?,,6,2018-02-27 12:16:52,8
USDT,Altcoin,Price stable altcoins,"I think that price stability will save crypto from never getting adopted by the mainstream market.

Realistically volatility is what prevents consumer adoption.

Merchants cannot properly sell their stuff if in a matter of a day or an hour the price fluctuates a lot as it would force them to recalculate the price of all items they sell, which is simply not convenient nor even possible.

Same case for wages, if the the price drops after receiving the wage, the employees getting paid in coins would loose their purchasing power.

Same for individual transactions, in a matter of hours, the seller that has sold his service or item could loose the value of his transaction.

This is all especially true in a capitalist society where rich whales can manipulate the price, just as media that can do mass opinion manipulation (be it fudding or positive extrapolation) and overall market speculation from traders/bots.

So crypto NEEDS price stability.

Then what about Tether/BitUSD? They are doing hard pegs backed by entreprise assets. Basically it is centralized and one point of failure, while also being dependent from the USD as it is pegged to it (which is a problem as if the dollar falls it falls). Crypto is in the first place about decentralization so it is no good as these hard pegged coins like Tether would become like fiat but instead of having govs backing it, it would be private enterprises, so arguably an even worse scenario. Especially as the bigger such projects get, the harder will it be to maintain the centralized hard peg (they could also terminate him on a whim or getting shut down by govs or political/economical incidents).

That's why we must have a decentralized peg that brings stability without compromising decentralization, and from the last news there is only Bitbay developing something like that (called rolling peg or dynamic peg). It is scheduled for Q2 2018. It is gonna be huge in my opinion. The only weakness of it is regarding positive growth. If the market cap grows a lot (and the project must grow to get adopted and used), the price can move up fast, but thankfully it remains a stable progression thanks to the peg. Once the market cap stabilizes after the growth, it will be the most advantageous scenario ever because we would have total price stability while remaining entirely decentralized (compared to Tether and similar projects that sacrifice decentralization for stability).

What do you all think about the issue of volatility?

USDT,Altcoin,A couple of questions,"Hello, I've been reading (lurking) on here, and other subreddits, for about 10 months now. Over the last 8-9 months I've been (very slowly) investing in a few different crypto currencies.
There are a couple of things I have questions about though. I have searched around, but either couldn't find an answer, or didn't understand the information (this specifically regarding my second question). 
I'm not looking for ""x exchange is better"" or ""xcoin is better"" answers. I'm looking for answers regarding the steps to purchase ""x coin"". But if your answer suggests a more efficient way by USING a different exchange/coin, I'm open to suggestions.

In this scenario, I'm using Coinbase, Binance, and Bitcoin as my examples..

I've seen posts about buying Bitcoin through coinbase, transferring to Binance, then setting a limit order ""x Satoshi > x coin"".
But in this scenario, if the price of Bitcoin changes, (to my understanding) that affects your price of ""x Satoshi"".

Wouldn't I ""take less of a hit"" if I sell my Bitcoin for Tether, THEN set a limit order for ""x coin"" (assuming tether's price doesn't change)?

I'm a visual learner, so it's a little difficult for me to wrap my head around this.

My secon question is regarding taxes ( I live in the U.S.
 If I invest$100, then sell at $1000; is tax @ $1000 or $900?

Thank you for your help.",9,2018-09-22 17:58:54,5

USDT,Altcoin,WAVES news and updates,"**Waves (WAVES),** one of the top 50 currencies jumped  more than 11% on Tuesday, 19th Dec. It was caused by the most recent announcement of  virtual asset exchange Huobi. In the news it was  announced that Tether (USDT) support for WAVES assets in its international and Korean markets. 

 Huobi Global added **WAVES** paired with USDT at 10:00 UTC on Tuesday, saying the the coin will meet its Tether listing standards.  It is needed to mention that Korean Market  supports BTC and ETH trading for WAVES as well.

Of course, such news played its role and had an effect on the perfomance of WAVES . The price of it rose from $2.61 several minutes before the Huobi Global listing to $2.64 around 30 minutes later. The asset sustained its momentum and changed hands at $2.70 at 11:17 UTC, which was an 11.03% increase on a daily basis, as per Coinmarketcap data. WAVES clocked $25.9 million in trading volume in the last 24 hours, with Binance BTC, ETH, and Binance Coin (BNB) markets accounting for 45.5% of it, or $13.1 million. Trading in BTC and Ethereum amounted to $459,414 (1.6%).

At the moment,  **WAVES** ranks at number 21 on the cryptocurrency market capitalization list with $271.2 million in value.  

Therefore, I would say now it is pretty good time for looking more closely at this altcoin and it going straight to the green zone, strengthening its positions as possible.Expecting the range in the next 24 hours  of **$3,47-4.**

USDT,Altcoin,"Quadringa misleads Candains into thinking they hold CAD. You actually hold ""Quad Bucks""","Some not so great news for Canadians. I was informed today that holding CAD in the popular exchange Quadringa doesn't mean anything. You are actually holding Quad Bucks.

Terms:
7.2 All account fundings are considered to be purchases of QuadrigaCX Bucks. These are units that are used for the purposes of purchasing Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. QuadrigaCX Bucks are NOT Canadian Dollars. Any notation of $, CAD, or USD refers to an equivalent unit in QuadrigaCX Bucks, which exist for the sole purpose of buying and selling Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

So it looks as though tether isn't safe, quadringa is no longer safe....what options do we have left?

Four times faster, four times the supply, will stabilize at ¼ of BTC, or roughly 30x what it is now. But still, what happens when the mines run out and you have to depend on the holders to maintain the network? Actual specie is very hard to destroy, that’s one of the things that makes it specie. But BTC and LTC don’t exist without their networks, and do we trust those networks to exist when there’s no more mining incentive to keep ‘em clean? Asking for a friend
 
(The Evil One )

4 - Dash
 
Dash is probably a scam but probably too smart to get caught. Which means it isn’t actually a scam. God I just wish it would go away. It’s like that asshole in high school who you saw kill a kitten onetime but you know will show up to reunion in a sweet car and the sexiest spouse. Whatever they want, they get, especially if they don’t deserve it.

3 - BCC
 
The trillion-satoshi question: what coin will coinbase list next? But we know the answer: it’s BCC. In any kind of normal investing environment, this would be the single most obvious and actionable piece of information. But this isn’t going to happen until January 2018 and that is just soooo many lambo-moon cycles from now, so everybody is just waiting on the timing. It’s stupid and I hate it but it’s true, especially because the tech on BCC kinda totally sucks. It’s hella slow and basically rests on Moore’s law being Newtonian, if not Einsteinian, in its consistency. If we were at all smart we’d all buy it & take the next four months off. But we won’t because we’re dumb fucking manimals who love the hunt. Fuck you BCC, for making an idiot out of me every goddamn day. Speaking of impatience

2 - XRP
 
Yeah I get it. It’s not a crypto. It hates you because you aren’t a bank. It’s mobbed up and centralized and all that shit. It’s everything we told ourselves we weren’t here for. But here’s the facts: that central bank you hate so much? It’s powerful not because it issues fiat currency. It’s powerful because it controls the rate at which banks lend to one another. That’s the realness, friend, because that’s the rate that matters and that’s what XRP is targeting. Ever try and make a swift transfer? Holy shit does that shit suck and suck slowly.
 
You want to whine about big banks? Well pick a side. Goldman or the Fed. Because XRP is going to actually do what everyone wishes BTC could - assuming they don’t get friendster’d by some better version down the line – it’s going to liberate the financial system not for the mommas and the poppas but for the pros. And sadly, we are living in the pros world. Anyone who understands the monetary system from a non-ideological position knows this. But it’s going to take five years and we all plan on being dead of MOON POISON by then. Fuck us.
 
** The Golden Child **
 
1 - Monero
 
Monero knows kung fu. Monero smells like jasmine and happiness and fresh baby. Monero puts the crypt back in crypto. Monero is Han Solo if Han Solo was also Pirate King of the Orz. Monero got laid four times while you were reading this. Monero solves all the problems. Not only is much closer to actually being *anonymous* than Dash and the rest of the JV wannabes, it avoids the future mining problems of BTC/LTC by maintaining a just-low-enough 0.3% inflation rate until the end of time, which means the mines will never run out, which means there will always be an incentive to keep it up and running. It already has a dedicated community of buccaneer utopians living it up on magic islands just over your horizon. Honestly, I wrote this entire post because I want someone to explain to me the problems with Monero because I can’t find ‘em. Dive in, lean back, and do not forget to *enjoy the sauce*

USDT,Altcoin,HUOBI LAUNCHES NEW CRYPTO MARKET INDEX - HUOBI 10,"Huobi, which is one of the top 3 cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, announced that they will be launching a new crypto market index called Huobi 10

According to a press release, Huobi 10 will track 10 different digital assets traded against tether \(USDT\), a dollar\-pegged cryptocurrency, on its platform in real time. This will allow the index to “reflect the overall performance of Huobi Pro market,"" enabling investors to get an aggregated feed rather than having to check on individual assets one at a time.

**COMPOSITION OF HUOBI 10 INDEX**

The list includes Bitcoin \(25.96&#37;\), Huobi Token \(25.57&#37;\), EOS \(15.57&#37;\), Ethereum \(12.30&#37;\), Bitcoin Cash \(5.55&#37;\), XRP \(4.30&#37;\), LTC \(3.31&#37;\), IOST \(3.02&#37;\), Ethereum Classic \(2.57&#37;\), Dash \(1.82&#37;\)

You can check out Huobi’s official release here: [https://www.huobi.pro/huobi\_index/](https://www.huobi.pro/huobi_index/)

**Maintaining Alpha Through High Performance**  

According to the historical data from March to May, the alpha of Huobi 10 Index compared to BTC is \-0.0028, while the beta of the index based on BTC is 0.79. And to top it off, Huobi 10 Index has scored well against Bitcoin \(BTC\) as well. This proves that Huobi 10 Index is effective in maintaining alpha while suppressing volatility.

**A Whole New World Of Financial Products**

With the creation of the Huobi 10 Index, Huobi is opening the gates to a host of blockchain financial products like crypto ETFs and blockchain derivative products. And the wait isn't too long either as these are expected to be released as soon as early June.

Earlier this year, with the launch of bitcoin futures there was talk of bitcoin indexes and bitcoin ETFs being launched. Huobi aims to bring investors one step closer to this with Huobi 10 and the crypto ETFs and financial products based on it.

Truly exciting times are ahead of us.",6,2018-05-29 13:11:36,1
USDT,Altcoin,Looking to begin purchasing altcoins,"I'm looking to get into buying and selling altcoins for cash. The further I look into it, the more questions I have. What I'm trying to do is buy and sell altcoins against fiat money, primarily the USD. I've looked around for exchanges and came across HitBTC which has a slew of altcoins to buy from.

Now, concerning the selling process. It does not seem like I can sell altcoins on that exchange and then withdraw them for USD. It doesn't even seem like I can purchase altcoins with USD directly. It seems like I may need to purchase Tether (USDT) to then begin trading against that. I'm just wondering if I'm completely off track or if I'm correct to assume this so far. Also, is there another exchange with a good amount of altcoins like HitBTC? I've seen some bad things coming from that exchange concerning losing BTC and money.

I'm looking for altcoins mainly because of the daily fluctuations and low price point to begin trading. Does it seem feasible to purchase USDT (Tether) to purchase altcoins then sell the altcoins after it increases for more USDT (Tether), then convert the Tether to USD for use. I'm mainly looking for quick turnarounds.",1,2017-11-10 17:59:46,3
USDT,Altcoin,Comprehensive overview of STABLECOINS - PART 2,"FIAT COLLATERALIZED STABLECOINS
**Fiat collateral for creating a token represents reserves held by a central entity.**
How it works: The mechanics for implementation are fairly straight-forward. A third party takes deposits in US Dollars (or another desirable fiat currency) and issues a unit of stablecoin for every dollar deposited. To cash out a unit of stablecoin, the third party wires US Dollar to the holder and burns a unit of the stablecoin.
Pros:
* Easy to conceptualize
* Value will match USD with certainty if properly implemented (digitized dollars without capital controls)
Cons:
* Must trust third-party to hold fiat collateral
* Need additional third-party for audit to make sure appropriate collateral is being held and units of stablecoin match deposits
* Expensive and slow to audit

Also, here are this week's stats on the most mentioned cryptos on reddit, as well as some recent posts from other redditors that I found extremely educational!

**Background:** I wrote a program that scrapes reddit posts from r/cryptocurrency and r/altcoin, calculates how much certain cryptocurrencies are mentioned, and uses a machine learning model to give each post a sentiment score. Understanding crowd sentiment can help give an early indication of the next potential 10x crypto, or just a general understanding of where the market could be headed. I'm always doing more research into the data so stay tuned for updates, and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!

**RECENTLY TRENDING CRYPTOS**

**Interesting Highlights**

1. Jibrel Network (not in the table below but in the Google Sheet linked to below), a recent ICO, started getting discussed more in the reddit community. Jibrel is one of the few to completely pass [icocheck.io's ICO due diligence checklist](https://github.com/ico-check/ico-check/issues/14), a resource I highly recommend using.

2. Another recent ICO to appear for the first time on this list is THEKEY. Looking at the posts and comments themselves (in the Google Sheet below), most of the posts are link posts and not text/self posts, and the comments overly positive, indicative of paid shills and/or bots.

USDT,Altcoin,The People's Republic of Cryptocurrency,"As a thought experiment, let’s assume all the recent 
rumors about Chinese regulation are true. What can we infer about how events will play out in the Middle Kingdom? 

  
**PBOC Will Ban Private Exchanges**

  China will ban private exchanges from trading against CNY. It’s 
inevitable.  
  PBOC has to maintain control of the value of the Yuan. The Chinese 
economy is currently almost entirely dependent on their export market. 
This market is maintained by keeping the Yuan at a fixed value, which increases 
international dependence on Chinese exports.  
  Current crypto-exchanges undermine that control and allow money to 
flow out of the country at an unpredictable rate.
  

 **PBOC Will Create A People’s Coin Exchange (PCE)**

  You can’t just shut things down without offering an alternative. 
Shutting down private exchanges will not stop the masses from trading in
 cyptocurrency, only drive them to operate in the dark, creating 
an unregulated black market.
  China already has immense problems with tax evasion. Tax evasion is 
rampant, and so taxes are kept high to compensate, which punishes 
legitimate business. Creating a PCE solves these problems. If the only 
place to trade Yuan for Crypto is through a PCE, then all transactions 
can be taxed and monitored. The higher amount of taxes being collected 
means that overall tax rates can be lowered, further strengthening the 
Chinese economy. 
  A PCE also prevents Yuan from leaving the country, which maintains 
PBOCs control of value. Furthermore, as China currently has 25% of the 
crypto market, consolidating that power will strengthen PBOCs influence 
over the global crypto market.
  

**PBOC Will Create Its Own Cryptocurrency (CNYT)**

  In order for a cryptocurrency to truly see widespread adoption, it 
needs to be stable. 
  This can only be accomplished through strict regulation. PBOC has 
strong incentive to create a CNY Tether (CNYT). A stable cryptocurrency 
will quickly dominate the market, being the only way to enter/exit 
trading at a fixed value without relying on fiat.
  It’s stability also allows it to be used for everyday purchases. 
Most importantly, having an internal blockchain allows PBOC to monitor 
the national and international movement of all Yuan, while keeping those
 records shuttered from the world.

  
**PBOC Will Approve ICOs On The PCE**

  The current pause on ICO trading is temporary. China’s recent pause on
 ICOs should be seen as indicative of their commitment to becoming 
international leaders in blockchain technology. The majority of current 
ICOs are infeasible, if not outright swindles. 
  By weeding out these bad actors, China can sow the field for useful 
technologies to bloom. Regulating the space will boost speculator’s 
confidence, promoting a surge of both private and institutional 
investment. More investment means faster growth.
  It’s important to note that, in many cases, the majority stockholder 
in the largest companies in China is, in fact, the state itself. 
This allows the state to maintain final say of private industry without 
stifling innovation. The government will often initially back competing 
companies, letting the strongest dominate the market with an implied 
monopoly.
  The same strategy will be applied to ICOs. This allows a period of 
rapid innovation, with a guarantee that the ultimate winner is the 
state.

  
**NEO And The PCE**

  Noting the above, it seems logical to conclude that NEO will be one of
 the first ICOs approved on the PCE. NEO is a Shanghai based platform 
for Smart Contracts and dApps. The project is also currently superior to
 comparable platforms in scalability (1000tx/s), quantum proofing 
(NeoQS), interoperability (NeoX), and consensus (dBFT). 
NEO already has a rapidly expanding international development base 
(CoZ). NEO is also programmable in C# and Java, and as such has a low 
barrier-to-entry for development. As such, NEO is intrinsically useful 
as the framework upon which to build a new wave of real-world blockchain
 applications.  
  As these projects will be funded through ICOs, it stands to reason 
that PBOC would only allow them to be developed using a Chinese 
platform.  As NEO is already a highly visible and developed project, 
with a fundamental goal of government compliance, the simplest and most 
effective strategy for PBOC will be to back the established platform.  
  NEO is highly centralized, with a strong emphasis on Digital Identity 
(KYC). It’s sister project, OnChain, has already been deployed in the 
private sector to provide legally verifiable digitally-signed documents.
 NEO and OnChain have inter-compatible frameworks (DNA). Thus, if these 
two platforms see widespread adoption (NEO as the public chain, OnChain 
as the private chain), every transaction on the chain will be linked to 
real world entity. This is in line with PBOC’s ultimate goal of not only
 tracking monetary movement, but knowing its point-of-origin.  
 
**The Road Ahead**  
  
  Though all of this is speculation, it seems a viable strategy for 
China to dominate the global crypto space.
  If they are not planning this course of action, should they be?

USDT,Altcoin,I Made a currency on Horizon. The goal of this currency is to be US's monetary system.,"The currency I made is called Liberty, prefix LBY, and is intended to be an non-inflationary currency for the United States. It is the first of its kind. Unlike Tether, we know the supply of this currency, and that certainly should eliminate inflation. The basis of this currency will go towards what makes America great. That is, the pursuit of Freedom without hinderance. By choosing this currency, we will put faith in the fact that technology can and will bring us more freedom given that we make the right decisions.

Specs: 

Number of Tokens: 325,841,868
Current Price: 1 LBY to 1 HZ

Rules:

As the creator of this token, and to give everyone a fair chance, I will not buy any LBY token until they are all sold. I will never raise the price during this sale.

Subreddit location:
https://www.reddit.com/r/LibertyHorizon/

To purchase, this must be done at http://nexthorizon.github.io/hz-source/#
If you are registering for the first time I recommend you send a small amount of HZ to another HZ address from that website wallet to write your private key onto the blockchain and maximize security. The wallet will prompt you to do so.

USDT,Altcoin,USDT => OPCT - worth a try?," I generally tend to give most altcoins a chance. You never know which one skyrockets eventually, so I usually invest a modest amount in the ones that look trustworthy. Or a larger amount if the project is really good.

Now that KuCoin launched a new trading pair OPCT-USDT and I have some spare tether on my hands, do you guys think it’s safe to take the risk and make the coin a good chunk of the portfolio?

USDT,Altcoin,Seascape.network the STEAM of DeFi...20x potential. Ticker: CWS/USDT on MXC.com,"Many of you have been waiting ages for my next investment call, and I've worked very hard to make sure I do not disappoint! Feel free to share my DD in any other subreddit or social media platform to raise awareness.

KEY DETAILS: CWS/USDT ([https://www.seascape.network/](https://www.seascape.network/))

**24h Trading Volume on MXC:** only 87,603 USDT

**24h Trading Range:** $25-$28.267

**Market Cap:** $26m (Audius was $27m when I first called them, it hit an ATH of $580m)

**Investors:** Binance, LD Capital, Paka, Spark Digital Capital, Nabais Capital, M6, DU Capital, JRR Capital.

**Partners:** Chainlink, Moonbeam, Opensea, Maker, Binance Smart Chain, Matic, Treasureland etc...

I got in at $25 today for $25k so far invested. Seeking price target of $500 (20x on $26m mcap to $520m in less than 8 weeks). Likely they will be listed on Binance around $125m mcap or sooner. It's Alt Season now so they *may* increase quicker OR ath may be higher OR both. Remember Audius took nearly 4 weeks to double from my 22 cent call then it exploded to $4.99. Price increases are not linear.

Recall, I developed a deep learning assisted bot to search the internet and work out which of these 1000s of silly coins will gain. CWS/USDT also popped up as another prime candidate gaining the traction metrics leading to organic big gains over the next few months. Add in a coordinated HODL at this volume level and you have a 20x-er. Untouched it has reached $50 by itself, **uncorrelated** generally to BTC, so its a prime alt season huge upswing candidate. Technicals also show a quick fib retracement to $50 within the next 2 weeks or sooner with good buying activity. No one was keeping track of what I said with Audius, this time, it may be different?

**Special Considerations:** Becoming the STEAM game distribution platform for DeFi is a much more realistic proposition than becoming a massive AAA-game developer such as the Activision of DeFi, we are years away from seeing anything like that. I've overseen game production in my past and it's a tough business! Delays happen all the time, and its ends up being expensive and taking much longer than anticipated (even if you x2 or x3 your most conservative time length expectations). Mu**ch better to be the picker and chooser of great games.** I also have contacts at Supercell (who made the great Clash of Clans) and I will hook these guys up. I spent the last few days talking to the founder of Seascape and drilled him for information and believe they are on the right track.

Like Audius, this is a coin with a website that the GENERAL PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND with a product that can be used now, granted they only have a few games, they are developing their blockchain to make it very cost effective and scalable for much bigger game titles to use them as their **in-game coin economy** partner, even if they have better distribution than seascape now. Seascape is an **in-game economy technology partner first and foremost. They are doing the hard stuff, unlike Ultra, so that they later this year become the distribution partner of choice for DeFi game titles.** Ultra is just steam with tokens and they are already around $250m market cap right now, so you see, Seascape could blow them out of the water!

**SEE BELOW FOR COMPETITOR ANALYSIS for when Seascape was JUST $528k mcap** at a $10m private investor valuation (when they first listed - they caught up to that private investor valuation within weeks and that was picked up by my crypto bot - very sorry for the few weeks lag, my bot still needs to crunch data, still working out how to find gems right when they first list but that's an extremely hard thing to do!!)

However, as with Audius, I hope another 20x is good enough, BUT I picked this up much sooner than Audius after listing so 30x is my hopium target although I don't want to be too bold. I am seeking $750 take profit if this one keeps rising strongly after surpassing $500.

NFTs: 25,000 NFTs minted on BSC and millions of dollars dropped to users through their LP mining game. Increase in its NFT economy alone could add an extra $50m-$100m to its mcap over the next few months.

**High number of coins in a few wallets:** Audius had a similar position where 84% of coins were held in 2 wallets. Seascape's token release schedule is structured to cause growth in their ecosystem and corresponding growth in their price to mitigate future inflation effects. Essentially new games will be backed by newly released CWS acting as collateral for newly minted game coin economies generated on the Seascape blockchain. This means, as a new game grows its user base and its in game economy grows in value, those additionally released CWS should in effect pay for themselves mitigating inflation effects. Interestingly, Audius had a similar reason for releasing new coins, i.e. to attract new artists, and it grew from $27m mcap to an ath of $580m.

USDT,Altcoin,Kaspa (KAS) 🦾: Redefining Blockchain Through High-Speed Block Production,"Kaspa is a Layer 1 blockchain that sets itself apart with a unique technology known as blockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). Traditional blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, follow a linear structure where one block follows the next. Kaspa, however, employs a blockDAG, allowing multiple blocks to be generated and confirmed simultaneously, which significantly increases throughput and lowers confirmation times. In practical terms, this means Kaspa can handle a much higher number of transactions per second compared to traditional blockchain designs, positioning it as a highly scalable solution for a variety of use cases.
In the world of Layer 1 blockchains, scalability is a recurring challenge. Many networks struggle to balance speed, decentralization, and security—a problem known as the blockchain trilemma. Kaspa’s approach is groundbreaking because it essentially bypasses this trilemma by creating a network where transaction speed and decentralization do not come at the expense of security. With the potential to produce 10 blocks per second, Kaspa has one of the fastest block production rates in the industry, making it suitable for high-frequency applications such as decentralized exchanges, gaming, and financial transactions.
Kaspa’s recent performance on the charts shows a corrective wave pattern, suggesting it may currently be undergoing a short-term retracement. This could be a buying opportunity for long-term investors, especially if Kaspa finds support at key Fibonacci retracement levels around $0.066 and $0.08. The price is also approaching a critical area on its exponential moving average (EMA), which has historically provided a strong support base during downturns. While it’s experiencing a consolidation phase, Kaspa’s fundamentals remain robust, and its unique technology positions it as a potential leader in blockchain scalability.

USDT,Altcoin,[URGENT] DYOR on this Project Before it's too Late,"Ladies and Gentlemen,

We went through a tough couple of weeks.

The recent events led to BTC dropping as low as **$53K**, causing **fear in the market** and many weak hands to either sell their entire holdings or scale down on their positions at the **worst possible occasion**.

https://preview.redd.it/zb3hafyajvdd1.jpg?width=963&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bea615499825787344eed404f90213cd2fa02847

  
Just as there couldn't be a worse moment to sell your beloved crypto, there wasn't a better time to get a position or top up your bags **at such a discount**.

 

When you have your eyes on **good projects with strong fundamentals**, you need to take calculated risks and buy the jeets' bags.

After only 5 days from a moment of ""**Extreme Fear**"", based on the ""**Fear and Greed Index**"", we're now back at a decent level of ""**Greed**"".

https://preview.redd.it/pmhj6nfcjvdd1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e42f279382b2fd59527fb383b61b37b8db6925f1

  
One of the ways to distinguish a good project from a less good one is to pay attention to **how the chart responds** when the market goes up after a dip.

Good projects with strong fundamentals have already **shown signs of a strong reversal**, gaining **50%**, **100%** or even more from the lowest point touched during the market crash.



One of those projects is certainly **$KENDU (Kendu Inu),** which went from as low as **$68M** back to almost **$150M** as soon as the market showed some strength.

 

That is an extremely bullish indicator to look for in a project.

https://preview.redd.it/h87d2ntdjvdd1.jpg?width=871&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2288fcc8d9531332c4aef39aacc4c862f4b10593

**COMMUNITY SENTIMENT**

Another important thing to look for is **how active the community is during a market crash**.

 

**Most ""projects"" go straight to zero or almost in this phase.** People in the TG group go silent, stop raiding, are sad, and eventually start looking around at the next shiny thing.

This never happens at **$KENDU**.

There is such a **big core group of OGs** who are always ready to **work and lead by example**. People coming to the Telegram group are always surprised by the warm welcome and the work ethic of the **$KENDU army**.

**The Kendu Inu community is more active during the dips than most communities are at ATHs.**

You want a **very active community** that is **always positive** about the project and ready to spread the word, especially when all the others around you are **too lazy and depressed** to do so.

https://preview.redd.it/cbf2wjpgjvdd1.jpg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bb459e0141fb998c9ba991fd2e300793ff1b977

  
**COMMUNITY GROWTH**

**But how fast is this strong Kendu community growing?**

Well, let's look at the data. Data does not lie.

 

**The project launched on Feb 21st.**

**May 1st -->** **160** members of the subreddit - **1300** on-chain holders – listed on **1 CEX**

**Jun 1st --> 1345** members of the subreddit- **6000** on-chain holders – listed on **2 CEXs**

**July 19th -->** **3554** members of the subreddit – **12701** on-chain holders – listed on **14 CEXs**

https://preview.redd.it/ay6ubk5jjvdd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98f10c2f3a8d6be101230fe6095bc25a64c97007

**100% organic**, after a slow start, Kendu Inu has seen exponential growth in the last couple of months.

**Kendu Inu has a very strong floor** thanks to diamond-handed holders with a big vision, a beautiful chart, **holders count growing daily** and good supply distribution where nobody holds more than roughly **2%.**

 

**That is the result of a combination of:**

-            Fair launch

-            Organic growth

-            No supply to KOLs

-            No big influencers calling you from the start and letting jeets form the floor.

-            An army with an extreme work ethic

**SUPPORTED BY SHYTOSHI KUSAMA  - TOP 50 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN CRYPTO –**

**Shytoshi Kusama** was included in the list of the **top 50 most influential people in the whole crypto space** earlier this year, as he has a huge reputation and a **multi-billion dollar project** under his leadership.

He recently left an interview where he said his goal for **SHIB** is to reach **One trillion dollar** market cap ($1000b).

He would never risk any of that to support a project that is either a **scam** or a mere **pump and dump.**

As of today, Kusama has followed the page on X and joined the Telegram group to say hi and ask for details after **$KENDU** went from **$2.8M** to **$60M** market cap in just a few days.



He asked: ""**Why up so much? lol**""



It has also been confirmed that he has been holding a fat bag of **$KENDU** since at least **$1M** market cap.

Even though all details have yet to be revealed, it is known that **$KENDU** will play a role in the Shib ecosystem, which might explain Shytoshi's involvement in Kendu Inu.

Make no mistake, though, Miazaki has always said that **Kendu has its own identity** and will not just be one of the small dogs existing under the SHIB umbrella.

At the same time, being a partner of the 2^(nd) biggest meme coin that ever existed from such an early stage is an extraordinary achievement.

**COINBASE LIKES THE STOCK**

News from last week: **Coinbase Wallet** showcased **Kendu Inu** in their new video ad (you can find it pinned on their X page)

**$KENDU** is the only meme project displayed there that is not in the multi-billions of market cap.



To be specific, these are the market caps of all the coins/tokens displayed in the video ad (at the time of the video being posted):

**KENDU**: $104 Million  
**USDC**: $33 Billion  
**SOL**: $66 Billion  
**BTC**: $1.2 Trillion  
**ETH**: $371 Billion  
**USDT**: $112 Billion  
**MATIC**: $5.0 Billion  
**PEPE**: $3.7 Billion



The second smallest meme **coin** in the video is $PEPE, which is sitting at $5.1b, about 40x from where $KENDU is right now.

**Read between the lines, people.**

The craziest thing about it all is that Dev said he had nothing to do with the Coinbase video ad.

He said ""I wish I could tell you I have buddies at Coinbase, but I don't. **That's because of you guys.**""

**Community-driven** projects focused on **organic growth** are the best.

**KENDU CHADS IS 99% COMPLETE**

Miazaki has always referred to Kendu as an **ecosystem**, it's always been part of the name of the TG group even. He says the **Kendu Inu Ecosystem** **will be the biggest in DeFi**, meaning there are big plans for Kendu in these coming months.

 

Kendu Inu's first **dAPP** is about to be released to the public.

**Kendu Chads** is not the final boss, it is only **the first piece of a big puzzle**.

Kendu Miazaki has left hints about what that may or may not be throughout the weeks.

 

**What we do know about Kendu Chads to date, is:**

* You need at least **5M** tokens to participate
* It is not staking
* You can earn **ETH** with it

 

There are no (and never will be) ""**sell the news**"" events at **Kendu Inu**. Therefore, details about Kendu will only be known once the **dApp** is out and ready to be used.

 

Even though Miazaki is an ""alpha vault"" (meaning he does not release info on the future on Kendu beforehand; he creates and then tells you what it is once it's done), he's hinted at the fact that **the goal is for Kendu to last for a long time, definitely more than a cycle**.

He once responded positively to a question from someone asking him if Kendu was supposed to maintain his value during a bear market.

https://preview.redd.it/s5ix9mfxjvdd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1d565ff999ee91ed8b967f58354113a219af522

  
**WHERE IS THE MARKET HEADED?**

It is clear that the cycle is, so far, repeating itself.

**There is no better entry than now** if you want to get into a project. Take a look at the picture below (right side) and see where we currently stand:

**On the final dip that usually precedes the start of the real bull run.**

We had the **BTC ETF** come out in January, and we have the **ETH ETF** going live just a few days from now.

**Rate cuts are planned for Q4**, and that, combined with the expected result of the **US elections**, should signal the start of the most fun part of the **bull run**.

There is going to be so much money flowing into the space.

Every project that is not a scam and has done well these past few months will inevitably do well in the coming bull run.

And when there is so much greed in the air that every shitcoin is in the green, what do you think is going to happen to such a strong project like [$KENDU](https://x.com/search?q=%24KENDU&src=cashtag_click)?

""Multi billions is not the goal. It is my standard"" - Kendu Miazaki.

USDT,Altcoin,CME Gap,"11/1/2024 10:00 PM #Bitcoin Update:

The #BTC/USDT price has now formed a new CME gap at $69,249, where we should see it trading around over the weekend. I believe the price will move up to the $69,990 resistance, then come back to the CME gap before breaking out towards the $71,979 resistance. 📈

As with any pattern, we could still see it fall below the CME gap, breaking the bottom trendline of the rising wedge and dropping to $69,000, or possibly the $67,000 support, before moving back up. Either way—up or down—90% of the time, the price moves toward the CME gap like a magnet! 🧲✨ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/",2,2024-11-02 02:10:59,52

USDT,Altcoin,"The Rise of peaq A New Era for Machine Economy
","on the search for the next PNUT and DOGE i stumbled upon some new projects and was waiting for some nice price action and i saw PEAQ, At its core, peaq is engineered to facilitate the seamless integration of machines, devices, and physical infrastructure into a decentralized, blockchain-based economy. This vision is realized through:  
  
**Decentralized Governance and Utility**: peaq provides the infrastructure for machines to operate autonomously, offering services across various dimensions - from land-based vehicles to drones in the sky or even equipment in space. This not only decentralizes control but also democratizes access, aligning with the ethos of Web3 where users and machines can interact without intermediaries.  
  
**Ecosystem Richness:** The ecosystem of peaq is vibrant, supporting over 30 projects with more than 850,000 devices connected. These projects range from energy management to mobility solutions, each designed to leverage the blockchain's capabilities to provide real-world services. This extensive network showcases peaq's commitment to not just theoretical blockchain potentials but actual, tangible applications.  
  
Users can stake Bitget's BGB or USDT to earn from a reward pool of 12,125,000 PEAQ tokens. This initiative not only incentivizes early adoption but also spreads awareness and investment in peaq's technology. The event runs from November 12 to November 19, 2024, offering a tangible way for crypto users to engage with peaq's ecosystem.  
  
peaq is not merely participating in the blockchain revolution; it's leading a charge towards a new paradigm of physical and digital integration. what's your thought on the project Growth ?

USDT,Altcoin,I want to share 1 tip so you can see the dip coming.,"First off, I should preface this with a little bit about me. Been around btc since 2012 and holding since.  I dabble in alts that I believe in. Good team / clear white paper and a solid value prop. I will never pump a coin just to pump, but I will dump a coin/token if I lose faith in the alt team or I don't like what's coming out of their camp. I'm pretty good at seeing through people.  If I bring up a coin it will come with sound reasoning. Moving on... getting to my tip.  

I believe everyone knows that BTC whales control the altcoin market. They have so much buying-power it’s insane. Many belong and participate in ‘whale rings’ and these rings purchase specific coins together and because they are using what is essentially all profit from mining or purchasing early BTC they can buy massive amounts of altcoins, pump the volume and price up substantially. This is one reason why things are volatile and will always be. Crypto wealth is extremely disproportional.  Dips happen often because if you buy a lot of coins for little money, you can make massive gains on a slight uptick and shortly after the whales are dumping. It's all strategic. Speculators tend to attribute dips to nonsense. From country or bank banning crypto or whatever. This type of BS is not the reason things go red. The reality is that whales influence the direction of the market. Call it what you want. This is how I see it. 

A lot of people ask me about timing/dips. Obviously, I don’t have all the answers but I’m pretty good at spotting where things are heading over a 24-72 hour period. It's not rocket science. Pattern recognition is pretty easy if you understand the order books and depth charts. But a really good indicator of a market shift or whale ring movement is putting USDT on your favorite list and watch it. When a dip is coming and things are going from green to red, give USDT a look (on the exchange you trade on not just CMC) and if it’s 1:02-1.03+ this means whales are using USDT as a bridge before they crash the market for the little guys. If you spot 1.03 you can be sure the whales are dumping the altcoin and putting their short-term gains and profits into USDT until the cycle starts again. If you review the USDT historical charts you will see high volume at these price points. USDT is a good utility to maintain gains if used properly. Generally speaking, whales tend not to go from altcoin to bitcoin when they know everything is about to dip because again, they control the market. Whales often swim together (pod, gam, school etc whatever you want to call it) and they pull out ( go their own way) at different times typically 12-24 hour periods because this is global and people sleep while others are up. 

USDT is a misunderstood coin. It’s a tool, a bridge, a vehicle... Not an ""investment."" Put it on your tracker and keep your eye on it when refreshing your alt portfolio. 

Hope this helps. If it doesn’t - don’t use my tip. 

Edit: so my intention was to post this just before the dip started but the original post got deleted by the auto mod. It was manually published after I discussed the issue with the human mod. If you view this pic you will see a before and after of the dip. I think this makes my point... sorta.  https://m.imgur.com/a/KNVpI",419,2018-01-22 06:21:15,143

USDT,Altcoin,Eigenpie: Liquid Restaking Platform on EigenLayer,"Imagine a platform where users can maximize their passive income while contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem. That’s exactly what Eigenpie offers. As a Liquid Restaking Platform within the EigenLayer ecosystem, Eigenpie empowers users to restake their assets, validate new services, and earn rewards—all while maintaining liquidity through Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs). Native ETH holders and liquid staking participants can enhance the utility of their ETH and ETH Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) by depositing them into Eigenpie. How would you like to see your ETH work harder for you?

Once deposited, Eigenpie restakes these assets through Node Operators on EigenLayer. These operators use the ETH and LSTs to support new “Actively Validated Services” (AVSs). In return, users receive LRTs, allowing them to earn rewards while maintaining liquid positions. Imagine earning rewards without locking up your assets. How would that change your investment strategy?
EGP is the governance and reward-earning token of the Eigenpie ecosystem. By integrating with different protocols and fostering innovation, Eigenpie aligns the platform’s growth with participants’ prosperity through EGP, driving user engagement. What features would you like to see in a governance token?

The project has reached a total locked value (TVL) of $1.17 billion, demonstrating steady growth and strong market confidence. What do you think contributes most to Eigenpie’s growing TVL? By supporting ETH and LSTs for re-staking, users can earn LRTs through Eigenpie, enhancing yield and liquidity opportunities. How important is liquidity to you when choosing a staking platform?

Eigenpie partners with platforms like Pendle, Pancake, and Camelot, and is backed by well-known institutions such as Arbitrum Foundation, PancakeSwap, and Relayer Capital. How do partnerships influence your trust in a platform? With solid fundamentals and improving market conditions, Eigenpie is a project worth watching in the secondary market. Its now listed on Bitget and Bitget is hosting a PoolX event where users can mine $EGP from a 6,255 $EGP pool by staking USDT or $EGP. Have you checked out the PoolX event on Bitget yet?

Eigenpie isolates risks related to any specific LST asset accepted by EigenLayer. Holders receive a specific Liquid Restaked version of their underlying assets, linked to the performance of the specific token that was restaked. How does risk isolation impact your decision to stake?

Through its alliance with ssv.network, users can seamlessly access Native Restaking on Eigenpie. This decentralized validation process aims to increase the reliability and potentially the rewards of staking operations, enhancing revenues for native restaking participants within the EigenLayer framework. What are your thoughts on decentralized validation processes?

Explore the future of liquid restaking with Eigenpie and unlock new opportunities for passive income and ecosystem growth. How will you take advantage of these innovative features?

USDT,Altcoin,8-Bit Coin ($COIN) - S&P 500 on steroids,"“We have created $COIN in 2024 with one simple goal, to render it as the most valuable gaming-focused  asset”. -Team

This project was created to level up game development on the Solana network. The goal is to on-board the next wave of web2 gamers into web3

I have always been bullish on GameFi. The potential of on-boarding players all around the world is huge there and 8-Bit Coin can be one of the best performers this bullrun.

$COIN is backed by **BONK whales that made millions** on this coin and now decided to create their own coin.

The interesting thing is that 8-Bit Coin has 3 liquidity pools. **Solana, USDT and previously mentioned BONK**. The connection between these 2 tokens is inevitable there and you can see it even on the official BONK X

This project is still in its early stages so buying now can he a huge opportunity that you do not want to miss. The chart itself looks insane and it will continue the established trend.

As one of our community members said. **“Literally the simplest hold, it's like watching the S&P on steroids.”**

USDT,Altcoin,crow with knife meme coin technical analysis from experienced FX trader - 07/08/2024,"[Yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowwithknife/comments/1eldann/crow_with_knife_meme_coin_technical_analysis_from/), we spoke about the global market crash and recovery and how CAW landed to a previously mentioned zone and rebounced hard....it was actually one of the top performers in the market yesterday. Already CAW has seen 100% growth from the dip on monday.

Today CAW has continued its rise and has managed to push through the 100 daily EMA, middle bollinger and the 40 mark which is both key level wick and a psychological round number however it is struggling to completely break this level so considerign it's a wednesday which is typically a quieter volume day I am not confident it will manage this today as much as I want to see the break today / expect to see it this week.

If price does fail I imagine it will remain in the high 30s before pushing to the purple zone on Thur or Fri...if it does break we will see the upper box trigger today.

I expect this purple box to break quite quickly if not right away and will update future levels once it does however the first one is quite wide as we see some wicks, a third touch trend line (if we do the same as the fib and ignore the oversold candles) and where the second highest peak meets the pivot at 70.

Price will most likely react to this quite wide area and we will see a bounce back down to the outside of the channel or a trend retest where price could revisit the low 40s before it makes its run for it's ATH.

When we looked at the CAWPrice/USD chart instead of the Market cap chart we saw the attempt at the 3rd touch to be much cleaner.

Yesterday price made a strong recovery and a further attempt at the [trend line break](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LmTtWBt7/)

The second attempt failed but is currently sitting at a point where it might make another attempt to break. The pattern below could be forming a bullish flag which would indicate another run higher...price is also curently sitting on a trend line indicating further support. The risk to this is that a bullish flag typically loses strenght when it becomes 1/3rd as long as the flag is high so we may need a catalsty to break the trend line without another pull back and attempt

Not much more to say until price breaks this line...if it fails it will probably move back to the trend retest we spoke about yesterday and if it does break we will see a decent rally before it pulls back to retest this current trend line. Once that line has been re-tested we take off.

**Proposed strategy**

DCA, buy dips , be patient...the roof is going to become a floor soon

USDT,Altcoin,crow with knife meme coin technical analysis from experienced FX trader - 08/08/2024,"[Yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowwithknife/comments/1em5xjk/crow_with_knife_meme_coin_technical_analysis_from/) we spoke about the recovery of CAW to the purple box that's been discussed since the [26th](https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1ecix4j/comment/lf58w8l/?context=3).

I suggested it would fail to trigger the box and then price would fall back to the high 30s before it headed higher on thurs/or friday. Price got so close to the box though ...that I have been debating calling it a hit.

Why this matters is that if then 3rd touch of the big trend line running from the peak is triggered on it's 3rd touch it will be FAR easier to break.

https://preview.redd.it/3dnojbhddehd1.png?width=1428&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6935af31ff81c2c11ecad79a14fc046615d7d39

Now I typically chart in market share view on DEX screener v USD however you can also chart on price view also versus CRO. This gives us 4 slightly different charts. By slighty different I mean price will be 2-3% off. If we were to look at price v usd chart we do actually trigger the box

https://preview.redd.it/36wwlk8deehd1.png?width=1700&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf719148a8c62363d479f529db3c4b08a50ad403

Price then pulled back to the trend line retest of the 6 week down trend line shown and the 38 fib of the latest move up as shown [here .](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ii3Bu7FR/)

https://preview.redd.it/i48j4pj4jehd1.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cee55ada7ee0d3288547ad2280fa9561174876

This means that despite a significant pull back later in the day the price action is pretty bullish and pretty soon ill be able to start discussing our next price targets in more detail

There is however still some downside risk as BTC looks like it's struggling to find bullish direction.

**Proposed strategy**

USDT,Altcoin,Bitget has announced its new Launchpool event,"Nowadays it is probably hard to find new events providing bountiful earning opportunities for traders, users and newbies. Sometimes we look for events that provide plenteous benefits but eventually end up getting very tiny amounts of reward for participation. Bitget is offering its Launchpool event for one of its newly listed ZETA projects sharing a huge amount of approximately 336k USDT worth of rewards. However individual reward depends on the amount of BGB that has been staked by a single participant implying that it can vary from participant to participant. The amount of BGB can a single person stake is capped at 100k BGB which is almost impalpable. 

Regardless of BGB staked, prize pool ROI can fluctuate over time and is 0.88% at present seems dynamic as incredibly increased from 0.5% thus it's albeit inevitable to change. Henceforth we might expect ROI to go as higher as the amount of BGB continues to accrue meanwhile we can't ignore the potential of BGB as it keeps rising with it. More than 36 Million BGB was staked so far assuming steady growth in its price. As I can remember the price of the BGB gained significant changes since the launchpool announcement from 0.58 cents to 0.64 cents which ultimately amplified those portfolios endured holding since the beginning of this Launchpool. The more the amount of BGB will be staked more the price will be enlarged resulting in participants ending up getting decent ROI on their investments and ZETA as a staking reward which is lucrative from my perspective.

USDT,Altcoin,Cryptocurrency is the next generation of money without intermediaries,"First thing that comes to my mind when it comes to crypto adoption is payment system. After all, BTC was created to cut middleman in everyday transactions. Right now, we can see more countries are open to crypto payments, and in my opinion we will see more and more in 2022.  

Second thing is UI, newbies in crypto are still not tech friendly, and they need simple solutions. I would like to hear your opinion on this topic, and especially about Utrust payment platform that is driving adoption through their merchants and different services in the HOLD app. 

 Just in case you don't know, Utrust is a seamless integration that gives e-commerce businesses the power to accept BTC, ETH, EGLD, DGB, USDT, USDC, UTK and other major cryptocurrencies as a means of payment for goods sold and services rendered.

USDT,Altcoin,Palmswap: A Non-Custodial Perpetual DEX on BNB with up to 50x Leverage,"The total volume of spot trading on all cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide exceeds $50 billion per day. While this is a large value, it pales in comparison to **the trading volume of crypto derivatives, which is $150 billion daily**. Derivatives are responsible for the majority of trading volumes in the crypto market, and a significant portion of stablecoin supply is also used in derivative trading. In other words, **derivatives are the backbone of the crypto market**.

Most of the trading in crypto derivatives is currently concentrated on centralized exchanges, with DEXs accounting for only a few percentage points. However, decentralized exchanges are growing much faster. In the foreseeable future, **trading volumes for derivatives on DEXs will increase to hundreds of billions and, eventually—trillions of dollars**.

Among the decentralized exchanges for perpetual contracts, notable projects include dYdX, Perpetual Protocol, GMX, Vela Exchange, Metavault Trade, MCDEX, TakePile, Palmswap, and several others. dYdX and Perpetual Protocol are well-known and covered by many analysts. I want to cover their lesser-known counterparts, which are riskier for trading and investing, but could potentially offer a higher upside. This article will examine [Palmswap](https://palmswap.org/).

# Palmswap v1

Palmswap is a decentralized exchange for trading perpetual contracts with leverage on the BNB Chain.

The exchange was launched in 2022, and in October of last year, the team **raised over $4 million** in investments. Additionally, several million dollars were also raised in March of 2023.

In February, the Palmswap team launched Alpha Mainnet. Palmswap V1 is built on an AMM algorithm and allows trading of perpetual contracts with leverage of up to 10x. The exchange offers limit orders, market orders, stop-loss orders, and take-profit orders.

# Palmswap v2

This summer, v1 will cease operation and be replaced by Palmswap v2. The main difference between v1 and **v2 is the on-chain trading engine**. While v1 is based on AMM, v2 is built on a synthetic architecture that is more scalable and sustainable.

https://preview.redd.it/7et7fe5xdr1b1.png?width=2133&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dbefb8909dac5abd310877ae4e026b6f691a080

The full list of v2 features includes:

* Perpetual trading (long and short);
* Up to 50x leverage;
* No registration or deposit required (non-custodial);
* All trades are on-chain;
* 0% price impact;
* Median spot prices. No scam-wicks;
* No order books or liquidity for each pair. Single PLP vault for all trading pairs listed for higher capital efficiency;
* Synthetic leverage. Up to 50%+ more capital efficient;
* Real-time spot prices on-demand and on-chain via Chainlink;
* 1-click trading;
* No front-running;
* Liquidity providers (USDT) will be receiving up to 60% of trading fees;
* PALM token stakers will be receiving up to 30% of trading fees;
* New UI/UX.

# PLP Event

Liquidity providers are critical for the success of Palmswap v2. To attract them, Palmswap plans to hold a [PLP Event](https://palmswaporg.gitbook.io/copy-of-palmswap-v2/ecosystem/lp-event) in the coming months.

In exchange for providing their capital in the form of USDT, liquidity providers will receive a share of the trading fees, as well as PALM tokens. **A total of $500,000 worth of PALM tokens will be distributed among liquidity providers.**

https://preview.redd.it/cr1x1ip0er1b1.png?width=1230&format=png&auto=webp&s=729b78c853b51313c9ee5ea009d8f4bf5a5e636d

Liquidity providers will receive 1 PLP (PALM Liquidity Provider) token for every 1 USDT they contribute. The full list of rewards for PLP token holders includes:

* 60% trading fees paid in USDT;
* Losses credit to vault, PLP benefits;
* Borrow Fee;
* Liquidation Fees;
* Mint / Burn fees.

The PLP vault acts as a counterparty for all trades made on the platform:

* When traders win (positive PnL), their profits are paid from the vault.
* When traders lose (negative PnL), their losses are sent to the vault.

The vault not only incurs losses from traders, but also receives a significant **60% portion of leverage trading fees**, as well as 100% of the mint/burn and borrow fees paid hourly, which are proportionally divided among PLP holders to incentivize them to remain in the vault.

The synthetic nature of the Palmswap protocol v2 eliminates the possibility of impermanent loss, because liquidity is provided solely through USDT.

Palmswap’s Roadmap

* May 15, 2023: Applications for participation in the PLP event started.
* June 1, 2023: Launch of the [referral program](https://docs.palmswap.org/protocol/referral-program). Referrers receive a share of trading fees for inviting new users.
* June 20, 2023: Deadline for applications for the PLP event.
* June 27, 2023: Early PLP event access.
* June 27, 2023: Global Event starts.
* July 5, 2023: Launch of Palmswap v2.
* July 26, 2023: Start of [Trade 2 Earn](https://docs.palmswap.org/ecosystem/trade-2-earn) competition, which will run in two stages in July — August of 2023, and in August 2023 — July 2024.

PLP minting will begin on June 27. PLP can be exchanged for USDT eight days after the launch of Palmswap v2.

Conclusion

Palmswap is a DEX for leveraged trading on the BNB Chain. The second version of the protocol, which is launching this summer, looks promising, and the team seems to have enough capital to see their vision through and weather out the crypto winter.

USDT,Altcoin,The Crypto Listing Paradox: The struggle for all Small Crypto Projects and How to Prevail.,">**The Crypto Listing Paradox: The struggle for all Small Crypto Projects and How to Prevail.**

In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, gaining a listing on a centralized exchange (CEX) can be a pivotal moment for any project, opening doors to liquidity, exposure, and potential growth. However, for small crypto projects, this journey comes with a paradoxical perverse challenge – the Crypto Listing Paradox.

*“The business model of centralized exchanges as we know today, encourages fraud and project failure.”*

CEXs, often regarded as gatekeepers to broader market participation, present a complex set of requirements for projects seeking a listing. While these platforms can significantly boost a project’s credibility, the demands placed on small crypto projects, with a small marketcap, can be financially frightening. Here’s a breakdown of the challenges faced by these projects:

1. **Listing Fees:** CEXs typically require projects to pay substantial listing fees (up to $500.000), acting as a barrier to entry. For smaller projects with limited resources, this initial financial burden can hinder their chances of securing a listing. So CEXs will let those projects pay with their own tokens. After the project gets listed, the tokens are being dumped by the CEX to pay for the fee and the token price plummets. Leaving the crypto community and the project with bags full of sand.
2. **Market Maker:** Beyond listing fees, CEXs may recommend or mandate projects to engage market makers to enhance liquidity. This adds another layer of cost, as market makers often charge fees for their services.
3. **Marketing Campaigns:** To stand out in the competitive crypto landscape, projects are often asked to invest in marketing campaigns like trading competitions. This expenditure, while potentially beneficial for exposure, poses a challenge for projects operating on tight budgets.
4. **Community Engagement:** CEXs expect projects to bring in traders from their own community. This requires active participation and engagement, putting the onus on project teams to foster a vibrant and involved user base. This often results in buying fake followers and pumping fake volume to meet the CEXs requirements.
5. **Volume Maintenance:** Maintaining a high trading volume is crucial for remaining listed on a CEX. Failure to do so can lead to delisting, resulting in the loss of funds invested in the listing process.

The paradox lies in the fact that the only way to avoid paying exorbitant listing fees for listing a token on a CEX is, to already be a sizable project.Which only seem to be achieved by being listed on a CEX. Paying exorbitant listing fees is a risk that always reflects back to the crypto community.This Catch-22 situation creates a perverse challenge for small crypto projects striving to gain visibility, traction **and protecting their community.** These things cannot possibly go together.

However, there is hope. The crypto community plays a vital role in breaking this paradox. Collective action, even in small doses, can significantly impact a project’s trajectory. A few minutes of engagement each day, whether through group messages, tweets, retweets, or comments on influential accounts, can contribute to building the necessary momentum.

While the Crypto Listing Paradox poses a significant hurdle for small crypto projects, community support and active engagement can be powerful tools for overcoming these challenges. By fostering a collaborative spirit within the crypto space, we can help promising projects defy the odds and thrive in the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets.

Justmoney’s decentralized cryptocurrency platform, [just.money 1](https://just.money/) on Polygon, Ethereum, Tron, Binance Chain, and BTTC addresses the Crypto Listing Paradox by providing a cost-effective defi platform. It offers projects an opportunity to list tokens free of charge across multiple blockchains, within a fast growing decentralized crypto ecosystem that goes beyond the limitations of traditional centralized exchanges. Here is how:

1. Projects or tokenholders can provide liquidity that can be redeemed anytime.
2. Providing liquidity the liquidity provider earns 83,30% of the trading fees from the platform.

*For example: the annual interest on the JM/USDT pool on Binance Smart Chain is at the time of writing, over 12%.*

1. The other part of the fee (16,70%) is being used to maintain the platform.
2. The JustMoney Suite for small crypto projects comes with an Automated Market Maker, a Payment Terminal, an Invoicing System and many more tools.
3. All services are free of charge but financed by each transaction.

*“This business model is much more sustainable than current business models of the traditional centralized exchanges.”*

The recent partnership between [TheManeToken 1](https://x.com/TheManeToken?t=tbAdgiS60Fc6WaKg6B70tQ&s=09) and [JustMoney](https://x.com/JustMoneyIO?t=9YHn8Qd2IkC4qij__IePkQ&s=09) can tackle the Crypto Listing Paradox by leveraging Mane Token’s marketing expertise. Mane Token’s strategic campaigns and engaged community can enhance visibility for projects on Justmoney, fostering cross-promotion and addressing B2B needs. With Justmoney’s presence on multiple blockchains, the collaboration aims for sustained ecosystem growth, offering a decentralized and sustainable alternative to traditional exchange listings and marketing campaigns.

USDT,Altcoin,"Confirmed reversal indicator on the Daily Chart of TLOS ""Bag Some"" has Appeared after the Collaboration Announcement with GameStop!","2 days ago, GameStop made an exciting announcement that sent shockwaves through the crypto and gaming communities. The renowned retailer revealed its partnership with Telos Network, a prominent Layer-1 blockchain protocol that has now rebranded itself as ""Layer Zero"", (meaning on google: https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+layer-zero+blockchain&oq=what+is+layer-zero+blockchain&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30l3j0i390i650l3.9178j0j4&client=ms-android-xiaomi-rvo3&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8). This strategic collaboration marked an important milestone in GameStop's Web3 expansion strategy, generating significant interest and speculation among investors and enthusiasts alike.

Following the announcement ( https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/gamestop-teams-up-with-the-telos-foundation-to-grow-web3-gaming-strategy/ar-AA1bZRTG ), it became evident that this partnership had a direct impact on the price of the TLOS token, the native token of Telos Network. The chart displayed above clearly depicts a substantial price pump for the TLOS token, the market's enthusiastic response to the news. This surge in value demonstrated the market's anticipation and optimism surrounding the potential synergies between GameStop and Telos. Chart here: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/telos/

Given the notable price movement and the growing buzz surrounding this collaboration, many individuals have aped into this market. The term ""ape"" in this context refers to entering a market with significant enthusiasm and investment, often driven by FOMO (fear of missing out) and high-profit expectations.

Before deciding to explore this network and potentially invest in the TLOS token, it is crucial to assess the fundamental aspects of Telos. One of the key features highlighted by the network is its promising no-downtime characteristic. This means that the Telos blockchain aims to provide a highly reliable infrastructure, ensuring uninterrupted availability and functionality. Such a feature can be particularly appealing to users who value stability and reliability in a blockchain network.

Additionally, Telos claims to offer the almost-zero  transaction fees compared to other blockchain networks. Lower fees can be a significant advantage, as it enables users to conduct transactions more cost-effectively and facilitates broader adoption of the network. However, you still need to conduct thorough research and evaluate the network's fee structure in relation to its scalability, security, and overall performance to gain a comprehensive understanding of its competitiveness.

DYOR: A lot of hype has obviously been out by the latest deal between GameStop and Telos, but investors should proceed with caution and complete thorough due diligence before making any choices. Happy Trading 📈 🙂",22,2023-06-03 20:46:33,10

USDT,Altcoin,StrikeX DD - $STRX - This Past Month,"\*\*These are my views and my opinion on StrikeX Technologies Ltd. & TradeStrike BVI. These views do not reflect on an official TradeStrike Team standpoint\*\*

Before I start, please take some time and read my other \[DD’s\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/TradeStrike/comments/12n4zeg/strikex\_dd\_strx\_the\_king\_of\_rwa/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradeStrike/comments/12n4zeg/strikex_dd_strx_the_king_of_rwa/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf))

\*\*A summary of what’s the come\*\*

* StrikeX secures large institutional client
* StrikeX Wallet Roadmap
* Wallet Download Milestones 
* Verification on Twitter 

\*\*StrikeX secures large institutional client\*\*

This is a big one to start off with, on the 8th May we got the announcement that StrikeX has secured an institutional client for their new Web3 Consultancy Service.

\*\*What is a Web 3 Consultancy Service?\*\*

StrikeX will provide education and advise corporations on the full potential of Web3 and it’s ever changing digital landscape. StrikeX will be the market leading advisor for this industry. 

\*\*What does this mean for StrikeX and it’s followers?\*\*

StrikeX is evolving and extending their reach in this industry. This means that the organisation is becoming more than a project that can deliver innovative products and bridge the gap between traditional finance and web3. 

“Furthermore, we are thrilled to have already signed our first client, a prominent UK-based financial institution with global operations.” \[Medium\]([https://blog.strikex.com/strikex-secures-large-institutional-client-e0d819de0266](https://blog.strikex.com/strikex-secures-large-institutional-client-e0d819de0266))

The above statement from StrikeX adds some proof that this amazing concept can and is working.

“We aim to empower institutions, including financial organisations, corporations, government entities, and nonprofits, by equipping them with the knowledge and tools needed to navigate the realm of the blockchain.” \[Medium\]([https://blog.strikex.com/strikex-secures-large-institutional-client-e0d819de0266](https://blog.strikex.com/strikex-secures-large-institutional-client-e0d819de0266))  This shows that StrikeX is here for the long term, from being For The People and providing retail investors the best trading platform to being the go to for institutions to learn about the blockchain. 

What this means for the StrikeX holders is that we are buying into more than just a 24/7 Tokenised Marketplace. We are buying into a massive organisation that will specialise in so much more than originally thought. Thus creating more demand to be a holder of this coin. 

\*\*StrikeX Wallet Roadmap\*\*

There are 13 steps to this new roadmap and I will try and give as much detail as possible.

* P/L algorithm replacement
* This has been long requested by the community and the Team are showing that they are listening.
* Ledger integration
* Ledgers are one of the most important devices in the crypto world as they keep your tokens the safe they can be since it is a physical cold wallet storing device. Having Ledger integration in the StrikeX Wallet allows users from all over to use the wallet to link with their device. This will attract more serious users.
* Buy/Sell checkout workflow V2
* This is quite self explanatory, it’s an update on the checkout when you buy or sell. 
* Biometrics on/off button 
* There will be an option for you to toggle the biometric login.
* Arbitrum & MATIC integration
* Integrating Arbitrum & MATIC will cause a spike in downloads as both communities love it when a wallet supports their network.
* V2 in-app browser / Marketplace 
* This feature will cause a lot of people to come to StrikeX Wallet as it is one feature I personally use a lot on other wallets. If this is done correct and seamless to use then I believe this could be the factor that causes StrikeX Wallet to really take off. 
* In-App Notifications 
* There will be updates and you will be notified within the app itself.
* Additional on/off ramp service (BANXA)
* BANXA is a trusted company that allow on and off ramping fiat. Having them will enable StrikeX Wallet users to have the option between Transak and BANXA to on and off ramp. 
* NFT Integration
* The NFT marketplace has over 250,000 users per month who are actively trading on OpenSea alone. This marketplace is ever growing and this means that StrikeX opens that door for scaling with them. 
* Service Availability / Support page
* There will be an area where users can view & request support for any problems they may come across during their time on the wallet. 
* Full V2 Interface UI Update 
* The best looking wallet out there is about to look even better. 

\*\*Wallet Download Milestones\*\*

Recently on the 4th of May the StrikeX Wallet surpassed 12,000 users in total with 5,000 on Android. Since the launch at the end of September 2022 the wallet has scaled beautifully in downloads. Smashing through the projections and has been very impressive.

\*\*Verification on Twitter\*\*

\[TradeStrikeBVI was verified as an official organisation on Twitter\]([https://twitter.com/tradestrikebvi/status/1648983287237337090?s=46&t=qgFIuoGqkM\_ep9eF5UBTEg ](https://twitter.com/tradestrikebvi/status/1648983287237337090?s=46&t=qgFIuoGqkM_ep9eF5UBTEg)) in April, this is a great step to mitigating the fake accounts that try to scam holders & followers. 

\*\*Conclusion\*\* 

StrikeX is moving in the best direction, with outstanding news like securing an institutional client for their Web3 Consulting it shows that they have the trust of major entities. 

A few people are scared because the price is very low and they aren’t seeing their holdings grow in value as much as the bull market in 2021. However, there is a massive group who know what they hold and why they are holding, they have been surprised with the extra catalysts like TradeX, StrikeX Wallet and now the Web 3 consulting. Personally, I bought because of TradeStrike: The 24/7 tokenised marketplace for the retail user. And that hasn’t even came out yet! All these extra products are amazing to hear for me, a long term holder. 

The paper hands will forever regret selling in 2023 when StrikeX is the market leader battling with the likes of Binance.

&#x200B;

\- Over 5500 holders

\- Tokenomics: 100 trillion supply, with burn capped at 70 trillion tokens (40 trillion burned on day one)

8% tax per transaction, 2% goes to redistribution, 1% burn, 5% marketing and dev wallet (of which 30% is injected as liquidity, 20% goes to marketing and 50% funds development)

\- Registered as an LLC (SGE LLC) in Michigan, USA

&#x200B;

What is SGE? There are 3 major components to SGE. 1) An NFT platform for space photography (astrophotography) 2) An iOS and Android app to remote control deep space telescopes to mint your own NFTs, where you pay for time with SGE tokens and 3) sgechain blockchain auditing division for new cryptocurrency projects - this is unique as there are no real auditing services with a doxxed team. Ankur Shah is the chief auditor who is the CEO of Erience Solutions in New York. The first audit has been completed! This auditing service is poised to set a new benchmark in crypto auditing with in-depth analysis of the audited contract. 

&#x200B;

\-The team behind SGE is fully doxxed and there is a great Telegram community involved with the project. The project is audited by [solidity.finance](https://solidity.finance) with a perfect score: [https://solidity.finance/audits/SGE/](https://solidity.finance/audits/SGE/) In the future, a set portion of the dev/marketing fund will be used to send kids in the United States to Space Camp and for STEM bursaries to support education in the STEM field.. 

&#x200B;

SGE also has a partnership with Blockchain App Factory whom are assisting in producing our NFT Platform which will be live later this week.

In April, a partnership with Down Under Observatory in Colorado USA was made. Down Under is ran by Terry Hancock who is a NASA affiliated astrophotographer and will be providing NFT's for the platform.

SGE has obtained a partnership with crypto influencer Crypto Wendy O and has brought her on in an advisory role. This week, a dedicated social media manager has been brought on to help promote SGE via the social media channels.SGE has an official WSB facebook partnership.

**SGE Design Team is also working on a potential partnership with Tom's Shoes.**

&#x200B;

***In addition tomorrow we'll get a youtube video from Chico Crypto (250k subs) !!***

USDT,Altcoin,"MaxxChain: The upcoming Layer 1 Proof of Work EVM Blockchain is coming soon. PWR (Power) coin presales sold out, CEX launch incoming!","MaxxChain, the upcoming Layer 1 Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain powered by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), is thrilled to announce the successful conclusion of its 2-Phase presale for $PWR coin, the platform's native chain coin. The presales witnessed overwhelming demand, resulting in both phases being completely sold out, amassing a total of over $250,000 USDT.

With the resounding success of the presales, MaxxChain eagerly looks forward to its upcoming listing on its first centralized exchange (CEX) in August 2023. Investors can anticipate an estimated opening price of $0.012, offering early investors a promising opportunity for growth.

The presale success has limited the available avenues for acquiring $PWR coins before the mainnet launch. Interested individuals can now accumulate $PWR coins by staking $MAXX tokens on BSC and ETH networks. The $MAXX utility tokens, developed and deployed by the Maxx team on the BSC and ETH networks, will also be listed on MaxxChain (paired with $PWR) following the mainnet launch.

The fully diluted pre-mined market cap for $PWR coin is projected to be $12,000,000. However, to enhance the coin's value and attract potential investors, a burn of 60% of the supply is planned shortly after launch. This strategic move will result in a reduced market cap of $4,800,000, amplifying the coin's attractiveness and potential for growth in the market.

MaxxChain's mission is to simplify the crypto space for developers, projects, and users, and as part of their commitment, they will emphasize education for their users while fostering developers and projects in need of assistance. The platform will provide extensive resources through its website and knowledge base, along with programs designed to nurture projects during their early stages of growth.

USDT,Altcoin,StrikeX DD - $STRX - (The King of #RWA),"**These are my views and my opinion on StrikeX Technologies Ltd. & TradeStrike BVI. These views do not reflect on an official TradeStrike Team standpoint**

Before I start, please take some time and read my other [DD’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradeStrike/comments/zj0umf/strikex_dd_strx_2022_with_strikex/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)


**What is RWA?**

Real World Assets. 

This acronym is taking over crypto Twitter recently and will continue to gain traction. So what exactly is it? 

RWA stands for Real World Assets. This includes, but is not limited to, Tokenisation of Real World Assets. These are assets outside of the blockchain that get tokenised to allow them to be integrated into the decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem. 

For a far more in depth [explanation of RWA’s read this article by StrikeX.](https://blog.strikex.com/understanding-the-tokenisation-of-rwas-6f82cdc1b28d) 

**Whats the difference between Synthetic RWA and Tokenised RWA?**

Synthetic:
“A Synthetic RWA token is an on-chain token that gives the holder exposure to the price of a real-world asset. Holding a synthetic asset token does not afford ownership rights to the underlying asset. Simply put, you do not own the real thing.” - [StrikeX Medium](https://blog.strikex.com/rwas-you-need-to-know-this-not-all-tokens-are-created-equal-3cf4f54e8847) 

Tokenised:
“In contrast, Tokenised RWA tokens offer a digitised replica of the real-world asset, which can provide token holders with ownership rights, such as voting and dividend payments. In short, you own the token; you own the real thing.” - [StrikeX Medium](https://blog.strikex.com/rwas-you-need-to-know-this-not-all-tokens-are-created-equal-3cf4f54e8847)

So essentially, Synthetic is a copy and Tokenised is the real thing. 

**How is StrikeX the king of RWA?**

StrikeX has been building their flagship product TradeStrike over the last 2 years focusing deeply on a 24/7 Marketplace for Tokenised Assets tailored to the retail investor. 

They will utilise their token $STRX to carry out all transactions on the [Stock Token Bridge](https://twitter.com/tradestrikebvi/status/1646197066878664722?s=46&t=0N8lW-ec-ykgUx9-y7bNhg) thus bringing the stock market volume to the StrikeX token.

“At StrikeX, we have long recognised the inevitable shift towards a tokenised economy and have spent the last two years laying the foundations of an ecosystem that can harness its truly breathtaking potential.” - [StrikeX Medium](https://blog.strikex.com/understanding-the-tokenisation-of-rwas-6f82cdc1b28d)

You can read more on this [in their recent Newsletter](https://twitter.com/tradestrikebvi/status/1643683262223589381?s=46&t=0N8lW-ec-ykgUx9-y7bNhg) 

**How is Tokenisation the future**

With major institutions like BlackRock and Citi Bank on board you can never really go wrong.

“Institutional giants such as Citi Bank and BlackRock are now touting the tokenisation of RWAs as the single biggest use case for the mass adoption of blockchain technology. With a potential market size in the tens of trillions of dollars, and the World Economic Forum suggesting that 10% of Global GDP will be tokenised by 2030, the excitement around this emerging market is palpable.” [StrikeX Medium](https://blog.strikex.com/understanding-the-tokenisation-of-rwas-6f82cdc1b28d)


**Conclusion**

StrikeX is ahead of the curve with tokenisation of Real World Assets and is one of the few projects that are actually leading the tokenised RWA wave. I have seen many projects claiming to be all about tokenised RWA however they are Synthetic. 

I genuinely believe that StrikeX is the king of RWA and is in a prime position to absolutely explode. Especially with the way things are going. 

Here’s to health, wealth and prosperity 🙌🏼🍻

USDT,Altcoin,Opacity Storage (OPCT): A Comprehensive Overview,"Good day Altcoiners! This post will be a comprehensive overview of a small market cap project called **Opacity Storage (OPCT)**.

And yes, I have a bag. It’s one of my biggest holdings next to TEL, ONE, ADA, SIA and ETH. The reason why I post this is because I think small caps also deserve a place in r/altcoin. Especially when it's a project with a real use case and is already functional. Next to all the DeFi, NFT and Meme hype I think utility tokens also deserve some love.

So why Opacity? I'll try to be transparent so I’ll give you the pros and the cons of the project.

CoinMarketCap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/opacity/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/opacity/)

CoinGecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/opacity](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/opacity)

# What is Opacity?

Opacity is a private and protected cloud storage solution and OPCT is their utility token. With Opacity, payments, accounts, and files are 100% private. At the moment OPCT is only used to pay for storage plans. 1 OPCT is currently pegged to 64GB of data storage but the peg will go when their network will be decentralized. When decentralization will become a thing the token will also be used for staking, competition between nodes and (d)apps.

Nowadays data breaches are very common but with Opacity you don't have to worry about that at all. Opacity doesn't require any personal information so you can sign-up for a plan anonymously. They store no information on its users, so their cloud is a perfect place to store private information.

Their way of doing encryption is also interesting. When you want to upload a file via Opacity, the data is split into parts (chunks) and encrypted locally in the browser. This isolation ensures that a malicious actor cannot retrieve the user’s data, as it can only be accessed with the corresponding encryption key: the ​Opacity Handle​.

So without this key no one can access your files. Even if it’s centralized and a hacker gets access to your data, he won’t be able to access it because there’s no way he can decrypt it. Can you imagine how secure and anonymous it will be when they offer decentralized storage? This would be the perfect tool for people living in heavily censored countries like China. Heck, I can name a bunch of industries that will truly benefit from this service for sharing their intellectual property, legal documents and company secrets. I’m calling it, this will be the next Mega.nz!

# What can you expect in the coming months?

So yeah, there you have it. A crypto project with a truly working product and not just hype and words. Their CEO hired a complete new team at the start of this year and they’re now with 14 employees. They held an video AMA some months ago and they do video updates weekly. For such a low mcap this project has a lot to offer. It has potential to compete against other competitors like Sia and Filecoin. Check out the infographic where you can quickly read the benefits of Opacity and compare them with their competitors. Take a good look at the difference in market cap!

# What did they deliver so far in 2021:

* ‘Galaxy’ Whitepaper 2.0 for Decentralization
* Open Beta program for Opacity 2.0
* A lot of AMA’s with their CEO
* Weekly video updates
* Community favorite and call of the month of the CryptoStarship signals group
* Added USDT pair on KuCoin this week
* They recently hired more employees to focus on marketing

# Upcoming:

* Next week: Opacity 2.0, it’s their new and improved file storage system! Think of faster upload/downloads, new webUI, new metadata system, better sharing, updated API for everyone to use, etc...
* Easier ways to pay for their services (BSC or Matic bridge, credit card payments with Indacoin)
* More AMA’s, marketing efforts
* Mobile app for Android and iOS (in Q3)
* Decentralization (first tests in Q3)
* API documentation so more people can build their Apps on their platform
* KuCoin promotions (e.g. trading competition to increase volume)

Now let’s talk about the pros and cons about Opacity. Like I said earlier, I want to be transparent and honest about my findings and not just shill. So here goes:

# Pros:

* Cheap. As of the day of writing 1 OPCT is 22 cents. You can buy a 2 TB storage plan FOR A YEAR on their site for 32 OPCT. That’s $7,04 + ETH gas fees (\~ 10 dollar). Unfortunately the Ether Gas fees are high but it still makes it one of the cheapest storage solutions. For example: a 2 TB Google Drive storage plan costs you $120 per year.
* New team with a lot of experience, check [this Medium post](https://medium.com/opacity-storage/the-journey-to-opacity-2-0-starts-now-ac14bc692d5d) to get some more info about the new team. Talking about experience: their CEO, Jason Coppola worked for *Microsoft*, *Paypal*, and *Salesforce*. He knows how to run the place!
* Low mcap, lots of room to grow. Currently rank #866 on CMC.
* No sign-ups required, truly anonymous. You don’t have to worry that your personal information gets leaked.
* Easy to use, the release of the new mobile app and website will have an easy and improved user interface. Think of Google Drive, but anonymous, protected and decentralized.
* Strongly focused on privacy, uses high encryption. Encryption happens on your computer only, even the metadata of the file is getting encrypted.
* A great community with a lot of developers. Check the [community page](https://www.opacity.io/community-page) to see what’s being built on Opacity so far. This list is only getting bigger when this project grows and API documentation will be released.

# Cons:

* Even if the decentralized network will be deployed later this year, it currently is still centralized on AWS S3. End-to-end encryption on the metadata and files is Opacity’s greatest feature, so that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It’s just that decentralization would make it so much better of course.
* High Ethereum gas fees. If you want to buy an Opacity storage plan you pay an insane high amount of gas fees. Although it’s not Opacity’s fault that these fees are so high, they are planning to use a bridge like BSC or Matic to solve this problem.
* Missed deadlines. Originally Opacity 2.0 would be released in April but it got delayed by a month. Delays are a common thing in development, so it’s not such a huge deal breaker. But I thought it’s worth mentioning it at least.
* The project has a dark past, even if it wasn’t their fault: they are a fork of Oyster (PRL). In late 2018 the founder of the project exit scammed by minting tokens and selling them on the market. Leaving all investors, including the team that worked for him empty-handed. Fortunately, he’s in jail now thanks to a 2-year investigation by the FBI and the help of the Opacity team.

Good day #RoboFamily,

As a role of developer, we always try to do things at the community’s interests. And today, we launch this airdrop, which only occurs when we hit *5,000 HOLDERS*.

We believe that the humanity of our own community is the law of attraction to $RBIF

As such, let’s work together with us the Dev Team as well as the marketing agents to spread the awareness about #RoboInu. Let’s put our hands together to build this solid foundation 🔥🔥🔥

A snapshot of all existing holders on etherscan has been captured prior to this announcement to make sure there is no manipulation. Any purchase on Bitmart if it does not appear on etherscan, you will not receive the airdrop.

When we hit 5,000 HOLDERS holders on etherscan, only existing and new wallets with the valued mentioned below will be eligible to receive the airdrops. Transferred wallets are not eligible.

At 5,000 HOLDERS (the price at the time), below wallets (wallet value) will receive the airdrop

1. USD 500 or more=> airdrop of $100
2. USD 1,000 or more => airdrop of $200
3. USD 1,500 or more => airdrop of $300

As we progress, we will expand beyond token’s value such as educational fund for college and university students.

USDT,Altcoin,Sapphire and cBridge Integration Connect Top EVM Chains,"A couple of months back, there was a key piece of development that promised to be a game-changer in the world of interoperability of the dynamic web3 dApp ecosystem. I am talking about the Celer Interchain Messaging (IM) Framework [integration](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/celer-messaging-bridge-integration) with Oasis Sapphire that enhanced OPL functionality by putting in place a robust and secure two-way message-passing bridge. Then during a recent [workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvrG-occaWI), we got the first glimpse of cBridge, still in the testing phase. We were also promised that the full Celer bridging suite would soon be available to Oasis Sapphire users, which meant both IM and cBridge. The promise has been fulfilled now. Celer's cBridge is [live](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/sapphire-cbridge-integration-announcement) on Oasis Sapphire.

The significance of this integration is far-reaching as it is a testament to interoperability and smart privacy in web3 working in tandem. It also brings together the top EVM chains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon and connects them seamlessly to Oasis Sapphire's confidential EVM. As a result, users can enjoy the experience of a premium-design decentralized non-custodial asset bridge for cross-chain token transfers in the most secure way.

USDT,Altcoin,"RBIF Weekly: Holder Percentages, Mean Holdings, Median Holdings + Burnt","Quotation from: [https://www.reddit.com/r/roboinu/comments/tktace/weekly\_holder\_percentages\_mean\_holdings\_median/](https://www.reddit.com/r/roboinu/comments/tktace/weekly_holder_percentages_mean_holdings_median/)

**Hello and welcome to all the new wallets and new holders!**

This is my weekly update on some of the holder stats and RBIF information. I am getting information from etherscan so I do not know how this interacts with Bitmart, however I assume that these numbers only include transactions outside of Bitmart. Until the Bitmart transactions are available on etherscan these stats only tell part of the story.

The first figure below shows the percentage of circulating RBIF held by the top 10, 50, 100 and 1000 wallets. As the changes are quite small and difficult to see on the figure I have also made a table below to show how this has changed over the last week.

[ The percentage of circulating RBIF held by the top 10, 50, 100 and 1000 wallets over time. ](https://preview.redd.it/43pmj0jzdcp81.png?width=5905&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f0e8350fcde086bcc4e7f90b2927556878629b2)

All of the holder percentages have increased this week. This is due to the 1 % burn that happened last week, as the total circulating RBIF has decreased by about 1.7% it is expected that all these percentages will rise. **One of the top 10 wallets have sold a small amount of their tokens or moved them (90 Trillion of 1.8 Quadrillion).**

https://preview.redd.it/d6ku7tnnecp81.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=68e1e5e147d403d02e18a2000b2c83fbc4613bd8

The second figure below shows the mean and median wallet size on the left and the percentage of circulating RBIF on the right. I have added the marketing wallet to this pie chart. I have also made a table to show the changes in the last week.

[\(Left\) Mean wallet sizes in red and median wallet sizes in blue \(Right\) percentage of RBIF in circulation and burnt.](https://preview.redd.it/2wkh4wasecp81.png?width=6850&format=png&auto=webp&s=fade17a6ad706d9a8c706fdd366403070d1f966b)

The mean and median wallet sizes have both decreased. The mean wallet size has decreased from 19.4 Trillion RBIF to 18.6 Trillion RBIF (0.74 Trillion). This is again good news and the high mean is due to a very small number of wallets holding a quadrillion coins or up (20) which skews the mean. I feel like the median wallet size is more representative. This has also come down from 0.77 Trillion RBIF to 0.72 Trillion RBIF (- 43 Billion). Again reducing the size of the median wallet should bring more stability to the tokens price.

**1.01 Quadrillion RBIF** have been burnt in the last week the majority of which is due to the 1 % burn at the end of last week and the marketing wallet has decreased by **0.95 Quadrillion RBIF,** this is again due to the burn, which burnt tokens from the marketing wallet. The marketing wallet has started building up again after this, however as most transactions are being done in Bitmart, this recovery will take a while.

https://preview.redd.it/6w0l3yoyecp81.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d7d2e60bd975562061b2c2a802d6e8e450bf523

We have also had **114 new wallets** on Etherscan in the last week (2955-3069) and the subreddit has grown by **41 users** (4233-4274). We are currently getting **17 approximately new wallets** a day for the last week. The rate of new wallets was increasing steadily to reach the burn value of 3000 wallets. This has now peaked and there has been a slight decrease in the rate of new wallets.

And I still have not broke even. Noooo - I don't count backwards, doh! It's how I count and how my mind works. I know exactly how much fiat has moved out of my bank account into the land of hopium, and I know my goal is to move back as much fiat as I can. So this is how I count shit ... what's gone in compared to what's been pulled out.

I've only been into 2 tokens during my short time in crypto. SHIB and RBIF. I bought into the hype of SHIB and learned (pretty quickly) the meaning of FOMO, buying high, and selling low. After watching the steady decline of my SHIB I thought fuck it and jumped into RBIF during the first few days of Jan 22. Timing was just good luck bought on by a soft shill. I count myself as being a holder number between 1000 - 1200 or thereabouts. Dunno exactly because it was all a blur and I was still freaking out intensely by all the hoops you had to jump through back then and all the scare stories of being hacked while doing it.

Thanks to bank statements I know how much I've spent overall and what number past nine zero's needs to be reached for me to say (truthfully) Ahh ... I've fucking broken even - now I'm making!!!

USDT,Altcoin,StrikeX DD - $STRX - (FTSE-250 CMC Markets Invest in StrikeX),"\*\*These are my views and my opinion on StrikeX Technologies Ltd. & TradeStrike BVI. These views do not reflect on an official TradeStrike Team standpoint\*\*

Firstly, before I start here is a link to my \[Previous Ultimate DD\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/13oo3xk/strikex\_dd\_strx\_this\_past\_month/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=ioscss&utm\_content=1&utm\_term=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/13oo3xk/strikex_dd_strx_this_past_month/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1))

\*\*News\*\* 

\[CMC Markets who are a FTSE-250 company have acquired a 33% stake in StrikeX Technologies, Cementing a strategic partnership to revolutionise the digital asset industry\]([https://blog.strikex.com/ftse-250-cmc-markets-invests-in-strikex-technologies-cementing-strategic-partnership-8370f21f3df2](https://blog.strikex.com/ftse-250-cmc-markets-invests-in-strikex-technologies-cementing-strategic-partnership-8370f21f3df2))

This announcement came in the AM of the 9th of June 2023 and has gained a lot of traction already. 

\*\*What does this mean for StrikeX?\*\*

This is a major step for not only StrikeX but the Web3 industry as a whole, as far as my knowledge goes; there has not been a deal like this before with a Web3 Company. 

With a major institutional entity such as \[CMC Markets\]([https://www.cmcmarketsplc.com/](https://www.cmcmarketsplc.com/)) invested in StrikeX gives a lot of comfort to those who have been on the fence for a while. Many of those who are more traditional investors may have more respect and trust for StrikeX now.

“Our partnership with CMC Markets will bolster our position as early frontrunners in this dynamic and fast-moving industry, whilst validating our long-term vision and strategy. We strive to pioneer the delivery of traditional financial instruments, such as equities, commodities and bonds to the blockchain, whilst guaranteeing security, compliance, and ease of access via intuitive, secure, and user-friendly products. We are excited by the opportunity this partnership brings and we look forward to sharing more updates as we continue to grow and innovate.” - Joe Jowett, StrikeX CEO & Co Founder.

\*\*How does this affect the Stock Token Bridge?\*\*

Now this hasn’t been confirmed however if you read between the lines then you will realise that CMC Markets activates the stock token bridge. They are the vital component to allow the tokenisation of authentic shares. 

When a user buys a stock on the Tradestrike exchange then this is sent to the broker and the broker buys on the Stock Exchange. From there the broker will then send the share to be minted and sent back to the user. 

The broker in this case is CMC Markets. 

—— \*\*This next section is the FAQ’s from StrikeX.com\*\* ——

**\*\*Q1: Why is this investment and partnership important?\*\***

There is little doubt that blockchain technology such as the tokenisation and self-custody of real-world assets can revolutionise the financial industry, what is evidently clear, now more than ever, is that much more must be done by blockchain firms to ensure their growth and innovation is not derailed by inexperience and ignorance of regulatory frameworks.

The investment and partnership of CMC Markets into StrikeX technologies represents a great leap forward for Web3, the benefits of traditional regulated trading firms stepping in to the blockchain space are multi-faceted. Bringing with them expertise in regulatory compliance, credibility and trust, valuable knowledge, and experience. This partnership

serves as a promising pathway for healthy growth and innovation not only for StrikeX

Technologies but for the wider industry.

**\*\*Q2. Why CMC Markets?\*\***

CMC Markets Plc, whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker

CMCX , was established in 1989 and is now one of the world’s leading online financial trading businesses. The Group serves retail and institutional clients through regulated offices and branches in 12 countries, with a significant presence in the UK, Australia, Germany, and Singapore. CMC offers an award-winning, online, and mobile trading platform, enabling clients to trade up to 10,000 financial instruments across shares, indices, foreign currencies, commodities, and treasuries through contracts for difference (“CFDs”), financial spread bets (in the UK and Ireland only) and, in Australia, access stockbroking services.

Given the rapid pace of change and increasing adoption of blockchain technologies in the financial services sector, our partnership and investment from CMC Markets provide us with access to highly coveted expertise and market experience. This collaboration not only validates our long-term strategy but also accelerates our development roadmap, opening up possibilities for new innovative technologies and services.

This milestone is significant for both companies and the digital asset industry as a whole. By combining StrikeX’s expertise in tokenisation and self-custody technologies with CMC Markets’ extensive financial services experience, we are now in a strong position to revolutionise the way individuals and businesses invest in digital assets.

**\*\*Q3. What is the nature of the investment?\*\***

CMC Markets has acquired a 33% stake in StrikeX Technologies, with two CMC members being welcomed onto the StrikeX Technologies board, bringing with them their wealth of expertise and experience to contribute to the growth and ongoing success of the StrikeX business.

**\*\*Q4. Are there plans to merge StrikeX with CMC?\*\***

No, this is not a merger deal. StrikeX Technologies will remain an independent company, with CMC owning a 33% equity stake.

**\*\*Q5. How are CMC Markets’ products complimentary to StrikeX Technologies (what are the future plans)?\*\***

By combining StrikeX’s expertise in tokenisation and self-custody technologies with CMC

Markets’ extensive experience in financial services, both companies are now well-positioned

to transform the way people and businesses invest in digital assets.

—— \*\*End of FAQ’s\*\*——

\*\*My Conclusion\*\*

A partnership with CMC Markets was definitely something that people needed to see, those who were on the fence and those who are already invested. This brings so much more solidarity to TradeStrike and also proves the potential. 

An entity like CMC Markets does not just do deals like this without some proper due diligence (hopefully you guys read some of my posts lol). 

The community is fired up like it used to be and the price is making everyone happy. Those who know the price doesn’t matter at this stage are still equally as happy as those who care all about the price. 

It’s a great day to be a part of something special.

USDT,Altcoin,Avalanche (AVAX) Analytical Review 📊,"[Avalanche](https://simplehold.io/blog/article/what-is-avalanche-avax?utm_source=social&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=education_post) is a fast, scalable, and decentralized platform for developers of decentralized applications (dapps). The platform allows users to create fast and cost-effective EVM-compatible dapps as well as flexible and compatible private and public blockchains (subnets). [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/) is designed to eliminate some of the limitations of older platforms, including low transaction speed, centralization, and scalability. If in numbers, [Avalanche](https://simplehold.io/blog/article/what-is-avalanche-avax?utm_source=social&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=education_post) can support more than 6500 transactions per second with an absolute finality in 2 seconds. This speed is achieved thanks to the modular Avalanche architecture and an innovative consensus algorithm.

https://preview.redd.it/oav74m71yux81.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=805f877385df3bd88eb3a994321492d67dc6cb84

# Avalanche Architecture

simThanks to its modular architecture, [Avalanche](https://simplehold.io/blog/article/what-is-avalanche-avax?utm_source=social&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=education_post) is able to achieve a high level of scalability and speed without sacrificing decentralization and security. The Avalanche platform consists of three interacting blockchains:

X-Chain (Exchange). This is a decentralized blockchain for working with digital assets. Allows users to create and exchange digital assets.

P-Chain (Platform). This is a metadata blockchain that coordinates the work of validators and allows users to create and manage subnets.

C-Chain (Contract). The blockchain is designed to create smart contracts. As part of this blockchain, developers are building EVM-compatible dapps.

&#x200B;

* **Consensus Mechanism**

The P-Chain and C-Chain blockchains are protected by an optimized Snowman consensus. This ensures high throughput and security for smart contracts. The X-Chain is functioning based on the Avalanche consensus algorithm. This is a protocol that can achieve transaction finality in seconds.

&#x200B;

* **Avalanche consensus mechanism**

The revolutionary Avalanche consensus mechanism is based on an optimized directed acyclic graph (DAG) protocol. Its essence is that transactions are processed not linearly but in parallel. This approach allows the platform to achieve low latency, high throughput, and a leading level of security. In addition, the developers have set a low entry threshold for validators — to become a validator, you need to stake 2,000 AVAX. Due to such a low threshold, the network has thousands of validators, boosting decentralization.

&#x200B;

* **Snowman consensus mechanism**

Snowman is a modified Avalanche consensus protocol. This protocol is perfectly suitable for operations performed within the P-Chain and C-Chain. Transactions in Snowman are added to blocks linearly rather than executed in parallel. 

# Avalanche Use Cases

In the crypto world, Avalanche is widely recognized as an improved copy of Ethereum. Avalanche provides the same tools as Ethereum. Only it works faster and cost-effectively. In addition, Avalanche has its own Avalanche Virtual Machine (AVM), which is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Thus, within the Avalanche, developers can create their own digital assets, non-fungible tokens, as well as decentralized applications. Furthermore, due to compatibility with the Ethereum toolkit, developers can easily transfer their Ethereum dapps to Avalanche. Moreover, the platform allows individuals and companies to easily deploy their own blockchains for both private (permitted) and public use.

Avalanche solutions are already used by such famous projects as SushiSwap, Mastercard, Binance, TrueUSDT, 1Inch, Aave, Bitgo, and hundreds of others.

# $AVAX Token

[AVAX coin](https://simplehold.io/blog/article/what-is-avalanche-avax?utm_source=social&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=education_post) is a native currency of the Avalanche platform. The coin is used to pay network fees, staking, and provide a “basic unit of account” between subnets. To counter deflation, the developers have implemented a burning mechanism — that is, all fees in the Avalanche network are burned. Users receive up to 11% APY on AVAX staking. Everyone who wants to become a validator must stake at least 2,000 AVAX.

The soldier will come out with a mask on and pretend to be a waiter and will take off the mask to be reunited.

USDT,Altcoin,🍔 BurgerCities ($BURGER) Overview,"One of the most popular decentralized exchanges on the Binance Smart Chain, BurgerSwap, has decided to expand its ecosystem and present to users a fascinating project that combines all the trends of 2021 — the metaverse, DeFi, and NFTs. This direction is called MetaFi and seems to be the next stage in the development of the industry.

https://preview.redd.it/kjpoiskgkvc91.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e56a2feb45beb29323cb6a797e27440d00fd685

### What Is BurgerCities?

[**BurgerCities**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/burger-cities/) is a metaverse integrated with DeFi and NFTs. As in other metaverses known to users, players will be able to get into virtual reality, in which they can communicate with each other using avatars, travel, participate in battles, complete game quests, and much more. BurgerCities also disposes of a play-to-earn model, thanks to which users who complete quests, combat monsters, and so on can earn tokens and NFTs for their in-game achievements.

But what distinguishes BurgerCities from many existing projects? The participants of the metaverse receive rewards not only in the course of play-to-earn but also via many other economic models. Moreover, users will be able to participate in engaging gameplay as well as use DeFi and NFT services. Players can attend NFT exhibitions and trade NFTs on a peer-to-peer basis. Moreover, trading and staking tools are available to users.  


### BurgerCities Gameplay

Users who want to enter BurgerCities will need BurgerCities NFT heroes, in other words, avatars that will become a visual representation of players in the virtual world. At the moment, the developers hold many events through which you can get The First BC Residents IDENTITY Group and Burger Cities NFT skin. For more information, please navigate to the official Discord of the project.

According to the developers, each NFT Hero is a unique character with its own attributes that can be upgraded during in-game actions.

With the help of their NFT Heroes, users can participate in interactive gameplay, perform everyday tasks and quests and just enjoy the game. In addition, players will be able to participate in battles that have now become more strategic, thanks to a wide range of skills and class combinations. In the future, the developers plan to introduce PVP and PVE gameplay. Trading is also available to users, within which they can swap tokens, in-game exchange resources, and trade NFTs.  


### Black Market

Black Market is a trading interface where users can exchange any tokens almost instantly and with minimal fees. Black Market operates according to the aggregate trading model. Simply put, the platform compares the exchange rates of partner DEXs and CEXs and provides users with the most favorable offer. At the moment, BurgerCities collaborates with leading DEXs, such as PancakeSwap, MDEX, Biswap, Apeswap, BakerySwap, and so on. In addition, the project team recently announced a partnership with the DeFi liquidity protocol iZUMi, which allowed users to provide even more liquidity and competitive exchange rates.  


### Energy Plant

Energy Plant is a section where users can become liquidity providers. You just need to choose two tokens and deposit them into the pool. For example, BURGER and BNB. After that, you will receive a BURGER token displaying your share in the pool. The number of BURGERs grows over time and can be redeemed anytime.  


### Central Bank

Central Bank is a single-asset double mining aggregator with which users can increase income from single-coin mining. At the time of writing, 4142371.58 USDT has already been locked in the protocol, while 5564562.99 USDT has been distributed among users. A wide selection of tokens is available to users. For example, the most profitable is BNB. By adding BNB to the protocol, users can earn up to 8.00% APY. The reward is paid in USDT stablecoin.  


### BurgerCities Lands

Currently, the BurgerCitites metaverse is still developing, and only key plot scenarios are available to users. In the future, the developers plan to introduce PVP and PVE gameplay. Trading is also available to users, within which they can swap tokens, in-game exchange resources, and trade NFTs.  


### Final Thoughts

BurgerCities is rapidly developing and entering into partnerships with notable projects. For example, DEGO Theater is available to game users in collaboration with DeFi + NFT DEGO protocol. The protocol creates a diversified product portfolio that includes liquidity mining, NFT auctions, NFT Minting, NFT trading, and more. BurgerCities has partnered with Treasureland, a cross-chain NFT platform with mining, trading, and other NFT-related services. In addition, StarryNift, a gaming platform and one-stop shop offering the creation, incubation, auction, and trade of NFT collectibles, has also settled in BurgerCities.  

The concept of MetaFi is revolutionary and fascinating, so a project combining DeFi, NFTs, and the metaverse has a considerable chance of success. And given the vast number of partnerships with well-known companies, BurgerCities is probably one of the most potentially explosive projects in 2022.

USDT,Altcoin,"$SENSI Updates: $SENSI Listed on CMC, AND Locking Out NOW! 1 Step Closer to Smart Staking!","Sensible.Finance’s token, $SENSI, has undergone a 2-week long consolidation and shake off of paper handed investors… While it was a rough ride, many long-term holders remain extremely bullish on $SENSI - and here’s why:

1. $SENSI has JUST been listed on **Coinmarketcap**! We are a tracked listing now and there’s no where to go but UP!
2. We’ve recently been listed on one of the 10 top CEXs in the world - [Digifinex.com](http://digifinex.com/)! With over a 100 cryptocurrencies, and being one of the leaders in liquidity and volume, Digifinex has brought us exposure to over 4 million trusted users that sees potential in $SENSI.
3. Smart Staking is scheduled to be released in the coming weeks! (But before that…)
4. **$SENSI Locking is LIVE, NOW!**

As mentioned before, $SENSI’s Smart Staking will be released in 2 stages: SENSI Locking, and then Smart Staking.

**What are the differences between Smart Staking and $SENSI Locking?**

*Smart Staking*

Smart Staking will require BNB as input for a set, fixed term stake. The BNB will be used to stake in *10-15 different, pre-audited and whitelisted high-yield farms*, each day. The rewards and initial deposit will only be able to be collected **AFTER** the stipulated term is over. Smart Staking is inherently riskier than $SENSI Locking due to the fact that they are sent out to yield farms. However, the risk is compensated for through the diversification of the type of farms that the BNB is distributed to. What this means, is that if one farm makes a loss on any given day, the gains from the other farms will be able to mitigate the losses.

Rewards will be paid out to Smart Stakers in $SENSI, of which a certain percentage will be reflected to the *dynamic reward pool* for $SENSI Locking.

*$SENSI Locking*

$SENSI Locking is a steady, deflationary rewards program for $SENSI holders. Holders will be able to lock their tokens and be rewarded a percentage of the *dynamic rewards pool* (to be explained later), that is distributed to all $SENSI lockers daily. Lockers will be able to benefit from the inbuilt 4% token burn. The rewards will be paid out in $SENSI.

So what do we mean by a **Dynamic Reward Pool** for $SENSI Locking?

You see, we can’t afford for our Reward Pool to be depleted, right? So what we’ve done, was to promise a percentage of the reward pool to all $SENSI Lockers. The percentage is **NOT** fixed - it is dynamic and changes from day to day, depending on the reflected yield from Smart Staking - we expect this to be around 0.35% to 6% of the reward pool. This percentage of the reward pool will be distributed to all $SENSI Lockers by the amount that they have locked.

For example, if a total of 10 tokens were Locked, and you locked 1 token, you will receive 10% of the percentage of the dynamic reward pool that is paid out at the end of the day, i.e., if the pool has 1000 tokens and pays out 1% that day, you will receive (1% x 1000 x 10%) = 1 token as your reward for the day.

**And why is this beneficial to all holders?**

1. Since all the rewards are paid out in $SENSI, anyone who participates in Smart Staking are essentially paying for $SENSI.
2. With the in-built burn mechanism AND a reflection of Smart Staking yield into the dynamic reward pool, $SENSI holders are automatically rewarded, AND this ensures a healthy and continuous buy order of $SENSI.
3. Smart Stakers don’t miss out, either. With a higher expected return due to the lowered amount of risk incurred through Smart Staking, it essentially ensures a much more acceptable reward-to-risk ratio. AND you get paid in $SENSI. Which grows with every transaction.

*Here’s what’s been done, and what’s coming out, next.*

**DONE:**

1. $SENSI Locking OUT NOW!
2. CoinGecko, Blockfolio listed.
3. Digifinex listed, tradable now (SENSI/USDT)
4. TechRate Audited

**WHAT’S COMING NEXT:**

1. Smart Staking Release
2. Further Audits

USDT,Altcoin,DD on SeaScape.Network: strong potential to gain x30 over the next 8 weeks?,"On February 3rd 2021, I predicted that Audius, at $0.226 with a market cap of $27m would x20, 8 weeks later, Audius hit an ATH of $4.99 with a market cap of $580m. That post is given below and everything is documented and verifiable in time.

My next prediction is Seascape, and the market cap is just $28m rn, very similar to Audius, however, in contrast to Audius, the networking effects are arguably 'stickier' and more significant within the game developer space than in the music artist space which Audius targeted. Seascape currently has a 24h trading Volume (ticker: CWS/USDT) of just $105k on [MXC.com](https://mxc.com/) and $168K on [gate.io](https://gate.io/) and $1.7m total trading volume across all platforms (coingecko numbers).

The same deep learning bot used to identify Audius identified Seascape as a prime candidate set to experience organic exceptionally outsized gains over the coming months.

**Current Technical and Price Action Analysis**

Recent price action showed an accumulation phase occurred over 5 days within a symmetric triangle formation above the $15 support zone (which held strong with heavy buyer activity seen), leading to a 50% upside breakout move, extending price action above the previous support of $24. Price action now remains steady within the $25-$30 region and it looks like another symmetric triangle accumulation will be forming before a 2nd upside breakout soon, especially if holders buy in following this post. A vigorous Elliot Wave impulse completing a fibonacci retracement to $50 is now strongly predicted, with an expectation of turning the $50 resistance level into a new support for growth towards $100. Price action has crossed and is being watched to stay above the 50 day MA.

**Fundamental Analysis**

**Investors:** Binance, LD Capital, Paka, Spark Digital Capital, Nabais Capital, M6, DU Capital, JRR Capital.

**Partners:** Chainlink, Moonbeam, Opensea, Maker, Binance Smart Chain, Matic and Treasureland.

Seascape seeks to become the STEAM game distribution platform for DeFi and this is a much more realistic proposition than becoming a massive AAA-game developer such as the Activision of DeFi, indeed, we are years away from seeing anything like that. Like Audius, this is a coin with a website that the GENERAL PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND with a product that can be used now, granted they only have a few games, they are developing their blockchain to make it very cost effective and scalable for much bigger game titles to use them as their **in-game coin economy** partner, making Seascape a great choice even if a game developer has much better distribution than Seascape now (which would only help Seascape further market itself).

Fundamentally, Seascape is an **in-game economy technology partner first and foremost. They are doing the hard stuff, unlike Ultra, so that they later this year become THE distribution partner of choice for DeFi game titles.** Ultra is basically Steam with tokens with a few big name game developers using them as first movers focused on marketing and player incentives, and hit an ATH of around $250m market cap. Seascape can do what Ultra does in a **much** more powerful way using their current technology AND Seascape intends to build out much more intensive player incentivisation than those Ultra has on offer now, so in terms of market cap, Seascape has the fundamentals to exceed Ultra by a factor of at least x3. Seascape has the fundamentals to exceed Ultra by a factor of at least x3. Price target is $750 is 8-12 weeks.

I also have contacts at Supercell (who made the great Clash of Clans) and I will hook these guys up. I spent the last few days talking to the founder of Seascape and drilled him for information and believe they are on the right track for stellar growth. Moreover, Seascape's IDO platform for launching new games will be released soon so CWS holders will automatically become investors in an entire defi games industry that will be built on top of the Seascape network, much of the token release schedule is focused on growing that so the inflation effects of new token release should be more than mitigated by their use in supporting this new gaming industry sector which could be worth billions.

[CWS = Prime HODL Token](https://preview.redd.it/90qb78e3z7w61.jpg?width=1112&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b46a82295b547dbd6ae1e0b4d5c267ec505cdf38)

**Seascape and NFTs:** 25,000 Seascape gaming NFTs have been minted on the BSC and millions of dollars dropped to users through their LP mining game. Increase in its NFT economy alone could add an extra $50m-$100m to its mcap over the next couple months.

**Whitepaper:**

[https://f2be4719-641d-430b-92d5-747132d8c9bd.filesusr.com/ugd/061436\_2d3e0cc2c8cc41a0a42e3cc2d57c7e3e.pdf](https://f2be4719-641d-430b-92d5-747132d8c9bd.filesusr.com/ugd/061436_2d3e0cc2c8cc41a0a42e3cc2d57c7e3e.pdf)

**Remember**: this is a Reddit post, it is NOT financial advice, dispense your loads where ever you wish after doing your own DD and research and maybe throwing a dart at a wall. YOLO. I'm in for around 2,000 CWS held right now.

**Notes:**

pCWS is the bridged version of CWS (the currency of Seascape on ETH) on BSC (Binance Smart Chain). Users can bridge from ETH to BSC using poly.network bridge. 1 CWS = 1 pCWS as they are completely interchangeable. Here's a walk-through of Polybridge: [https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1](https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1)

**High number of coins in a few wallets:**

Audius had a similar position where 84% of coins were held in 2 wallets. Seascape's token release schedule is structured to cause growth in their ecosystem and corresponding growth in their price to mitigate future inflation effects. Essentially new games will be backed by newly released CWS acting as collateral for newly minted game coin economies generated on the Seascape blockchain. This means, as a new game grows its user base and its in game economy grows in value, those additionally released CWS should in effect pay for themselves mitigating inflation effects. Interestingly, Audius had a similar reason for releasing new coins, i.e. to attract new artists, and it grew from $27m mcap to an ath of $580m.

**KEY FEATURES:**

* Any game released on the Seascape Platform will have the option to create their own blockchain with its own set of rules. 
* Decentralized cross-chain bonding curve market to allow seamless price discovery of digital assets for users and projects
* User-facing game store built with DeFi in mind. Any user can serve as a PoS validator. Monthly gamepasses for users, no fees for game devs.
* Implement gamified aspects of DeFi and traditional finance into games as part of core gameplay. In-game staking, CDP's and more!

During the crypto market crash all presale buyers and paperhands sold so now we have a diamond community.

Check out a great interview with the dev's:

The latest price developments: +74% in the last 30 days. 

Current price: 0.00070 usdt
ATH: 0.025 usdt, right before the crypto crash in May.
So there is lot of upside potential after the crypto crash in May. We can do a 30x to our ATH in the next months.

The project is unique because it donates in tokens. So when the price rises so will the donation and all the investments. It's a unique win-win construction.

Elongate established itself as the first, biggest and most trustworthy charity cryptocurrency token in the industry after stipulating  partnerships with EB Research, a non-profit organization for treating chrysalis , Kimbal Musk's Big Green, Children International, Action Against Hunger, The Ocean Cleanup, The Human Relief Foundation, Mark Rober's Color The Spectrum, Give India and The National Kidney foundation. Elongate raised over 3 million dollars in the first two months of existence and all donation were recorded and live streamed with presidents, vice-presidents and representatives of said foundations. All donations were in BNB.

Elongate was listed recently on a major exchange LBank (ranking #15th Worldwide in terms of 24h trading volume) and was fully certified by CertiK, a blockchain company that conducts security checks on blockchain. It was awarded a high security rating of 90/100.

Very soon, we are also planning to be listed on a top 10 exchange, which will subsequently increase trading volume by large.

YouTube personality ZHC has also decided to join Elongate and create a video to support our cause. 

To give you an example of what ELONGATE community stands for, Elongate recently made a $150,000 donation to the EB Research Partnership (EBRP), the largest global organization dedicated to funding research for the treatment of chrysalis (EB). The work of the organization is based on the treatment of chrysalis and methods for developing the treatment of millions of people suffering from other rare diseases.

Another donation was made to the Million Gardens Movement to bring gardening education and garden resources to disadvantaged communities across North America, Elongate made a donation of 400,000. U.S. dollars to Big Green, a nonprofit founded by Kimbal Musk in 2011 to tackle food-related health inequalities and create a healthier place where children can learn and grow. This year, Big Green co-launched the Million Gardens Movement with online publication Modern Farmer.

Elongate is unique in its mission, for it makes the world a better place whilst allowing you to invest in it and potentially earning from the growth of the crypto. Elongate is also in the process of launching the world's first charity-focused exchange. This includes Elongate's charity wallet, NFT campaign, and other exciting crypto innovations by the second quarter of 2021. The team just launched a revamped version of the website during the 2021 Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency conference in Miami where we also distributed merch to participants, hired a pilot to skywrite Elongate over Miami and displayed our logo on many taxis all around the conference.

We recently paid for a major marketing exposure that displayed Elongate on billboards and projected our logo on buildings all over the world (Philippines Globe of Asia, New Delhi, Paris, Barcelona, Paris, Amsterdam, Milan, London, Austin, Toronto, Berlin, Manila, Bali, Seoul, Taipei, Rio de Janeiro, Jersey UK, Vegas, Copenhagen and Seoul again). Find out more about our marketing on the pinned messages on our telegram group, please remember to use only the link from the official website [www.elongate.cc](https://www.elongate.cc)

A merch store was also recently released - 80% of all the merchandise sales will be donated to charity, the rest will be used for marketing. Elongate is currently comprised of a 475,000+ holding community, with over 315,000 followers from all platforms and channels. Two Elongate giveaways are currently active for 9000 USD and 4500 USD, these will be presented by LBank directly, the rules can be found on the official LBank Twitter page.

USDT,Altcoin,"$SENSI Devs have doxxed, Updates from AMAs, AND a Wes Spencer Video!","$SENSI Devs have doxxed, Updates from AMAs, AND a Wes Spencer Video!

This is the #SENSIREVOLUTION. 

Sensible.Finance’s token, $SENSI, has recently been listed on one of the 10 top CEXs in the world - Digifinex.com! With over a 100 cryptocurrencies, and being one of the leaders in liquidity and volume, Digifinex has brought us exposure to over 4 million trusted users that sees potential in $SENSI.

In addition, the team has doxxed on their website! You may see part of the team’s Linkedin profiles, with their CEO having an impressive background, having come from both Google and Microsoft!

The community’s trust has been steadily growing over the past weeks, as we’ve had the team dox, 2 AMAs, AND a Wes Spencer video! For the uninitiated, Wes Spencer a Crypto Youtuber that does not simply promote ANY project that he is paid to… He believes in each of the projects that he chooses to promote, as his reputation is clearly on the line.

To have Wes promote $SENSI is a great step forward in gaining more trust from the community, as well as from new investors!

Having completed our AMAs over the past week, $SENSI investors now have a clearer idea of what is to come next, with various goodies available for investors to pick out! These include:
 1. The availability of $SENSI Locking to all investors,
 2. Hints to marketing pushes,
 3. Forms of utility that the team is planning to add, such as rug checkers/contract checkers to prevent scams from happening to you guys!
 4. Listings on other CEXs,
 5. The release of Alpha Testing to investors who have signed up!
 6. Ability to farm SENSI-BNB LPs on a low-risk farm!

If you already cannot wait, join us at our Telegram - https://t.me/sensiblefinance, and check out the transcripts for the 2 AMAs (in the pinned messages)!

Now if that isn’t enough for you to look forward to, just keep a look out for Smart Staking! Why?
Smart Staking is essentially the equivalent of an ETF, in the crypto space. And what does that mean for Smart Stakers, and $SENSI Holders? What is the difference between Smart Staking and $SENSI Locking?

Smart Staking
Smart Staking will require BNB as input for a set, fixed term stake. The BNB will be used to stake in 10-15 different, pre-audited and whitelisted high-yield farms, each day. The rewards and initial deposit will only be able to be collected AFTER the stipulated term is over. Smart Staking is inherently riskier than $SENSI Locking due to the fact that they are sent out to yield farms. However, the risk is compensated for through the diversification of the type of farms that the BNB is distributed to. What this means, is that if one farm makes a loss on any given day, the gains from the other farms will be able to mitigate the losses.

Rewards will be paid out to Smart Stakers in $SENSI, of which a certain percentage will be reflected to the dynamic reward pool for $SENSI Locking.

$SENSI Locking
$SENSI Locking is a steady, deflationary rewards program for $SENSI holders. Holders will be able to lock their tokens and be rewarded a percentage of the dynamic rewards pool (to be explained later), that is distributed to all $SENSI lockers daily. Lockers will be able to benefit from the inbuilt 4% token burn. The rewards will be paid out in $SENSI.

So what do we mean by a Dynamic Reward Pool for $SENSI Locking?
You see, we can’t afford for our Reward Pool to be depleted, right? So what we’ve done, was to promise a percentage of the reward pool to all $SENSI Lockers. The percentage is NOT fixed - it is dynamic and changes from day to day, depending on the reflected yield from Smart Staking - we expect this to be around 0.35 to 6% of the reward pool. This percentage of the reward pool will be distributed to all $SENSI Lockers by the amount that they have locked. For example, if a total of 10 tokens were Locked, and you locked 1 token, you will receive 10% of the percentage of the dynamic reward pool that is paid out at the end of the day, i.e., if the pool has 1000 tokens and pays out 1% that day, you will receive (1% x 1000 x 10%) = 1 token as your reward for the day.

And why is this beneficial to all holders?
 7. Since all the rewards are paid out in $SENSI, anyone who participates in Smart Staking are essentially paying for $SENSI.
 8. With the in-built burn mechanism AND a reflection of Smart Staking yield into the dynamic reward pool, $SENSI holders are automatically rewarded, AND this ensures a healthy and continuous buy order of $SENSI.
 9. Smart Stakers don’t miss out, either. With a higher expected return due to the lowered amount of risk incurred through Smart Staking, it essentially ensures a much more acceptable reward-to-risk ratio. AND you get paid in $SENSI, which grows with every transaction.

If this doesn’t get you thinking about how to make your money work for you in Crypto, what will?
Join us - join the #SENSIREVOLUTION. The onus is on us, to make our money work for us, and $SENSI will pave the way for you.

USDT,Altcoin,"Cirus just launched on Kucoin, quickswap and uniswap this morning. Ex Apple CEO Gil Amelio is on-board as a senior advisor and it looks to be VERY interesting","I have been following Cirus for a while and think it is a VERY unique project. They are launching router hardware which will be provided by ISPs and will allow you to monetize your history instead of just big tech selling it to third parties. There is also a software based solution which will work with their infrastructure. 

A few days ago they announced that ex Apple CEO Gil Amelio will be joining the team as a senior advisor.

I would highly recommend at least checking out their webpage to get a feel for the project. This has been 2.5 years in the making and looks to be a winner.

USDT,Altcoin,So you want an early moonshot eh?,"A Real Moonshot 🌙 $SYLO.


**This might be the best coin you have ever been this early on. This is a real established project made by doxxed devs and has been audited before. You are not buying into a one  anonymous dev shi/t coin project.**

If you don’t know yet, **$SYLO** is the next big kid on the block. 

**TLDR; I think it is best compared to the iMessage of the crypto sphere. End to End data encryption messaging system that allows p2p transactions in a few clicks. With over 200+ crypto supported, sending eth to your friend is just as easy as sending usd.**

Why $SYLO?

With **End to End encryption, decentralized nodes, Limitless scale, Layer Two payment system, and smart wallet applications.** **Sylo has it all**

The Sylo Network is a decentralised communication and storage network with the performance and scalability to support millions of users. Applications use the network for decentralised, private communication, storage, and micro-payments.

Instead of centralised cloud server infrastructure, Sylo users create the decentralised Sylo Network together by running Sylo Node software on their own computers. By running a Sylo Node, users earn Sylo Token in exchange for their device automatically providing critical services to the network.

The devs are active on Twitter and Telegram and usually answer any questions within a few minutes. There has been considerable development already this year and in this bull market now... it’s just a matter of time. 


So far the team has proven dedicated and transparent is every regard. They have released all their products on time including the newest smart wallet. The wallet currently allows staking of tezos and many more currencies are supported to send. 

With **virtually no competition**, this coin is a true moonshot. Unlike the current stake of this sub, I am not promoting any safexxxx or Elonxxx. I am promoting a real project with a real use case. 

FYI: Their app is fully developed and in both Google play and the App Store under the name Sylo. May you all enjoy your encryption and payments!

I have throughly looked over this project and determined that it is a hidden gem. But Please, Do your own research! This project WILL growth with or without you.

USDT,Altcoin,Lixir: automated liquidity concentration manager for Uni V3. APP GOES LIVE 22nd May 4pm UTC," Lixir Protocol delivers optimal capital efficiency, minimum impermanent loss and solves the inactive liqudity problem in Uniswap v3 yield farming. In other words, given a token pair, **Lixir optimizes and auto-balances your positions accordingly** **to achieve maximum ROI, minimum Impermanent Loss and minimum inactive liquidity**!

**Explanatory video**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwKP1kvweU&ab\_channel=LixirFinance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwKP1kvweU&ab_channel=LixirFinance)

❓What is Lixir?

👉Lixir is a liquidity concentration manager and incentivizer that maximizes your returns in the next generation of AMMs.

❓What is a liquidity concentration manager?

👉It's a program that pools assets from users and automatically rebalances the concentration of your liquidity as price moves to maximize ROI on the next generation of AMMs like Uniswap v3. Liquidity concentration managers do two main things in these systems:

1. incentivize new liquidity to come in so that rebalancing is possible when the price of a pair moves.
2. automatically manage those rebalancings and incentives so that users earn fees and LP rewards as consistently as possible

❓What about gas fees?

👉Lixir uses an algorithm similar to that of Uniswap v2 to track pool ownership. For each re-balance, it calculates the total amount of asset value in a pair pool, at current prices. Then, for each incoming user, it calculates the value of the assets they are putting in, and mints pool tokens proportionally.

👉As a result, users only spend gas when entering or exiting the pool, and the gas costs are limited to calculating the value of their incoming/outgoing assets.

The fees to re-price the NFT on Uni v3 aren't too expensive, and are paid by the incoming users at each re-balance event, for which they are rewarded.

❓Do I have impermanent loss risk?

👉 tldr: yes, but not as much as you're used to. Normal IL risk is spread out along the whole price curve, whereas with liquidity concentration, the action happens in a narrower part of the curve.

Example: you concentrate liquidity for DAI/USDC between 0.99-1.01.

👉If the price moves to 1.01, you will be left with 100% USDC and 0 DAI, but the IL is low, because their prices are still so close to each other.

❓Sounds great! Are there any other risks with liquidity concentration?

👉Yes, rather than IL, the risk is that you won't earn fees or LP rewards when the price moves out of your range. You also won't be able to re-price/re-balance without adding more liquidity to the other side of the pair. Lixir is specifically designed to solve this problem, but the risk is there if you try to do this manually.

❓When will Lixir be operational?

👉 **APP GOES LIVE 22nd May 4pm UTC**

The APY itself on concentrated liquidity is already very competitive but once we enable farming on Monday the APY will increase remarkably!

First Pools: 💧  
\- LIX/ETH (highest cap)  
\- USDC/USDT  
\- ETH/USDC  
\- WBTC/renBTC  
\- WBTC/ETH

What's to come:  
\- Lix staking and farming  
\- Lix requirement to join farming  
\- Governance  
\- Single sided liquidity entrance  
\- Pool cap raising  
\- No pool cap after audit

❓ Is Lixir just for Uniswap?

👉No, it is for any AMM that implements liquidity concentrations. We expect several platforms to follow quickly, and we will expand the automated management to handle those use cases as they come online.

USDT,Altcoin,AMA/ELI5 Why Arbitrage Spreads Occur in Cryptocurrency? How to Spot them in Real-time & Trade them Like a Pro? Wouldn’t One Whale be able take up all the Volume?,"First I want to give you a brief intro of myself... Last November - December I started noticing arbitrage opportunities occurring quite frequently in cryptocurrency markets just before and during the bull run and it is happening all over again! I was able to capitalize off of every single arbitrage deal I ever acted on... 20% or more each time in a matter of minutes. This led me to create my own arbitrage platform so I can could get alerted to these arbitrage occurrences in real-time. Here is a nice strategy I developed I 'd like to share with everyone...

##Be Ready at all times

* having money in **USDT** ready at all times on the exchanges you are comfortable arbitraging on 

* get an arbitrage alert platform that gets you the info you need to see the quickest 

* once you spot an arbitrage opportunity or get an alert act on it as fast as you can



##Follow this quick checklist:

✔️ act on HIGH VOLUME arbitrage opportunities (unless you are investing small amounts which is supported by the current volume)

✔️ act ONLY on arbitrage opportunities based on profit potential of 13% or more

✔️ MAKE SURE WALLETS ARE ONLINE on both exchanges

✔️ buy as many coins you desire from the exchange it is selling much cheaper while paying attention to make sure the spread still exists by checking the exchange it is selling for at a much higher rate

✔️ once you are done accumulating, transfer to the other exchange and sell as fast as you can 


>From my experience I was able to transfer most ERC20 coins in 7-10 minutes time and sell them pretty fast (40k worth) over a few minutes time. Some coins are known to transfer fast like XRP, ETH, Nano, etc. so it is wise to be familiar with coin transfer times. There are some like BTG that transferred on average of 15 minutes to 30 minutes although one time it took 3 hours but I was still able to make at least 18% or more every arbitrage opportunity I ever acted on. 

## Let's talk about why arbitrage opportunities occur?

A seasoned trader will understand that most coin prices begin to rise when breaking certain resistances and trend lines. News will sometimes create arbitrage opps but they are mainly caused by huge money being pumped into coins by institutions. Last December we seen that most coins chart displayed extremely bullish patterns. Once they broke resistance it usually rockets up to a higher price and usually starts forming a new pattern that will allow the price to go even higher. The amounts of cash flowing into coins at a much faster rate creates a spread between exchanges which creates an arbitrage opportunity.



## Let me debunk the misconception that one whale can eat up all the volume for himself using an arbitrage opportunity that happened just yesterday

Yesterday **ADX/BTC** was pumped up over 65%. It was trading for **$1.19** on Bittrex and **$1.47** on Binance which is around a 25% or more price spread between the exchanges. The **24 hour volume** on **ADX/BTC** on Binance alone was over [**$51 million dollars** most of which was traded during the arbitrage opportunity](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*4_M7O1xV8ItuSFipsmeD4g.png). That is a ton of volume for literally thousands of people to make a profit from by swapping these coins between exchanges. I usually trade around 40k at a time during these occurrences and I have no trouble getting my orders filled in minutes while transferring and selling on the other exchange.

##Arbitrage opportunities are common before the start of and during bull runs

Arbitrage occurrences usually occur at the beginning of bull markets and we are beginning to see them occur more and more on high volume exchanges. This is how we see the market caps rise and prices of coins go up so quickly...  Today there was another that occurred for ticker **DNT/BTC** this time it had even more volume roughly **$70 million dollars** worth on Binance alone. Unfortunately I was watching the movie ""A Quiet Place"" at the movie theatre so I wasn't able to act on the alert I received. 

Feel free to ask me whatever questions you wish! Here is the [arbitrage platform](http://arbiswap.com) also here is a medium post I wrote that goes a bit deeper https://medium.com/@chasarcaulon/why-arbitrage-spreads-occur-in-cryptocurrency-and-how-to-trade-them-like-a-pro-51869422c5d5. I obviously am quite familiar with arbitraging and it is the only type of day-trading I personally do so let me leave this disclaimer...

USDT,Altcoin,"$CWS Seascape Network is starting to go up very nicely! Partners with Binance, and Binance is launching Binance NFT in June. Don't miss this gem until its to late. New STEAM of Defi based on NFT, nice short term 20x and long term 50x potential! Still low MC!"," As you know, Binance announced they will launch Binance NFT in June this year. This is incredible opportunity for Seascape Network because Binance is already partner with them from the start! This will be huge this summer. 

Seascape introduced new game, Staking Saloon and developers just keep on giving on this network! **Play games to earn $CWS**, there is no better than that.

[https://bsc.seascape.network/index/product.html?skin=light](https://bsc.seascape.network/index/product.html?skin=light)

$CWS was found by the same redditor who told us about $Audius before it mooned! Now, after $Audius, we have $CWS, Seascape.

The Seascape Network is basically ultimate game platform designed around the DeFi & NFT Economy

**KEY DETAILS:** CWS/USDT ([https://www.seascape.network/](https://www.seascape.network/))

**Market Cap:** $29m 

**Investors:** Binance, LD Capital, Paka, Spark Digital Capital, Nabais Capital, M6, DU Capital, JRR Capital.

**Partners:** Chainlink, Moonbeam, Opensea, Maker, Binance Smart Chain, Matic, Treasureland etc...

They are partners with Binance, so you can buy via Pancakeswap $pCWS. pCWS is the bridged version of CWS (the currency of Seascape on ETH) on BSC (Binance Smart Chain). Users can bridge from ETH to BSC using poly.network bridge. 1 CWS = 1 pCWS as they are completely interchangeable. Here's a walk-through of Polybridge: [https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1](https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1) 

Its still listed on Uniswap, Pancakeswap, [Gate.io](https://gate.io/) and Bitmax, but big exchanges are coming soon. Since its already partners with Binance, Binance exchange is probably closer than we think. 

Like Audius, this is a coin with a website that the GENERAL PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND with a product that can be used now, granted they only have a few games, they are developing their blockchain to make it very cost effective and scalable for much bigger game titles to use them as their **in-game coin economy** partner, even if they have better distribution than seascape now. Seascape is an **in-game economy technology partner first and foremost. They are doing the hard stuff, unlike Ultra, so that they later this year become the distribution partner of choice for DeFi game titles.** Ultra is just steam with tokens and they are already around $250m market cap right now, so you see, Seascape could blow them out of the water! 

**KEY FETURES:**

&#x200B;

* Any game      released on the Seascape Platform will have the option to create their own      blockchain with its own set of rules. 
* Decentralized      cross-chain bonding curve market to allow seemless price discovery of      digital assets for users and projects 
* User-facing      game store built with DeFi in mind. Any user can serve as a PoS validator.      Monthly gamepasses for users, no fees for game devs. 
* Implement      gamified aspects of DeFi and traditional finance into games as part of      core gameplay. In-game staking, CDP's and more!

USDT,Altcoin,10SET DD,"First things first I am not a financial advisor nor am I a qualified individual to give financial advice, this is an educational series I will do on Cryptos I am interested in or Cryptos that have been requested to cover. I am not sponsored by Tenset though I do have skin in the game because I did purchase a substantial amount.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Tenset is a coin with crappy (Share my tweet,) bro marketing that actually has a strong team and shouldn't be ignored.

**Summary**

Tenset is a crypto on ERC20 that is aggressively deflationary.  The holders receive dividends by just sitting in the wallet and the organization is holding fiat assets like stocks that generate dividends and crypto assets which are coins that will be staked. 30% of ALL profits go to buying back Tenset tokens and burning them. Every transaction incurs a 2% fee 1% gets burned 1% gets redistributed to all holders. The amount received isn't determined by the amount of Tenset held but by the volume of trading, this is to prevent whaling. They have a full team of people, they are posting jobs on their site, and they have a legitimate Angel investor backing them. The deflationary mechanism is set to stop once there's an online 2.1 Million in circulation.

The only way to purchase Tenset is using uniswap though they are negotiating with a few coin exchanges in Asia. They've been aggressively adhering to their roadmap over 6 Million Tenset Tokens have been burned. They have 320 Etherium staking, and 1 Million USDT in a high yield account so far. There is a max supply of 210 million coins, the majority of which are not owned by the founders. They're distributed in various funds to maintain operations there's a complete breakdown on the website.

**Risks**

This coin isn't too good to be true and there are a few factors I have been actively monitoring. The first being they said that even if there's only 2.1 million left once it hits the hard cap on deflation they want to still be paying dividends from holdings. If they do it smart they would use this as a mechanism to slowly increase more coins, too much deflation can actually drive down the price of a coin and could even crash the currency.

The crypto has only been traded by the majority of users since March. There's plenty of time for the team to not hit goals and abandon the project.

This crypto by how it's being managed has a lot of potential for dramatic price changes this is due to only 11.7K people are currently actively trading and holding this crypto. I watched it swing from $3 to $2.40 within the past few days. Such things are normal in crypto investing but if they pull off what they are trying to this has long-term potential.

Their marketing right now is pretty bad. They do twitter giveaways through a hypeman they kick crypto to and to be honest it discredits the coin. I think they are trying to attract the typical Zoomer investor since the team is also fairly young. The problem is older people are most likely going to go for an EFT 2.0 long-term HODL.

Oh also be prepared to pay AWEFUL GAS FEES!

**Things to Consider**

They have an angel investor who's helping to steer the organization and keep it on track. The coin also has good tokenomics which encourages trade and HODLING both benefit the coin's ecosystem. Without people trading one of the core deflation and dividend, systems don't activate. The fact that dividends as distributed fairly also prevent a group of whales from dominating the market by rapidly compounding their coins.

By being deflationary this coin can hold some serious value. If there's less in circulation than bitcoin it may even outpace the price. Lastly, the coin actually does something of value by paying out passive dividends to holders. The Angel investor also shut down SAFEMOON on twitter so that was also an interesting exchange. The team genuinely wants to create a coin that's focused on people trying to hunker down and invest.

&#x200B;

**SO what now?**

It's up to you to decide if it's worth your time and resources or not. My risk tolerance is different than others. After reading the white paper I felt confident about potentially losing money on something that has promise. NEVER INVEST WITH MONEY THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE. Just remember every altcoin especially new ones have a lot of risks.

&#x200B;

I hope you enjoyed it digging in and reading about these cryptos are fun for me.[Tenset.io](https://tenset.io/)

USDT,Altcoin,Why You Should Be Staking That $BET bag right now.,"$BET is the native token for [Earnbet](https://luck.earnbet.io) Casino, the Original Decentralised Casino.

Built on the WAX Blockchain, it's the first Crypto Casino to go fully decentralised, offering players provably fair and verifiable games as well as full custody of their private keys.

Here's where it goes even better than the rest.
Apart from enjoying Chainlink Oracle Integration, which is a significant passmark, the Casino shares its entire profits from wagers made in Bitcoin & Ethereum to $BET hodlers who have their bags staked on the Casino. Profits from wagers made in other altcoins are used by the Casino to buy back $BET in the open market.
In other words, Hodlers who stake their bags get to claim dividends every month from player activity on the casino. 

So far since inception in 2018, over $9m in dividends have been paid so far.

$BET holders also enjoy Governance rights thereby defining the policy direction of the Casino.
With the coming Sports Betting features coming on the Casino soon, there's been a scramble for $BET by discerning crypto enthusiasts as that means more Bitcoin and Ethereum profits to share as betting volumes rise across board.

From a meagre price of $0.01+ in October 2020, $BET has hit $0.13 in mid February 2021 climbing slowly with sustained momentum. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/earnbet/

It will interest you to note that $BET tokens has over 80% of its circulating supply already staked for dividends with a significant value staked long term.

$BET can be purchased on Uniswap, BinanceDEX & HotBit.

https://uniswap.info/token/0xfdd4e938bb067280a52ac4e02aaf1502cc882ba6

Players also earn $BET tokens for each wager placed on the Casino tables.

PS: Get a $50 BTC Bonus on First Deposit. Earnbet accepts deposits in 14 major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, EOS, XRP, BNB, BCH, LINK, LTC & USDT.

There's also an ongoing $2,000 $LINK Giveaway for the Top 50 Players on the Casino's Leaderboard this week. Promo closes on 4/20/2021 12:00 UTC .",5,2021-04-10 21:06:57,1

USDT,Altcoin,"Everyone new to crypto, chill out ""cratering"" is par for the course.","My DM's on all channels have been blowing up. Everyone was gushing the next btc, the next eth, the next, the [insert symbol]... To the m**n. (so happy to see this phrase die). I told them to chill and to not refi their home or go into credit card debt unless they want to be stressed throughout 2018. The new year's spike was temporary and everything that went up will come down. The coins/tokens with a true value prop will rise again.  

Step away from your portfolio trackers and stop refreshing every 10 min. Get back to work, go to class, hit up yoga class or go snowboarding :). 

If your portfolio is down and you are buggin' out and can't stand the anxiety and pressure that comes with gambling do yourself a favor and set a limit for over what you paid, so you don't lose and get out. Problem solved. 

If you didn't spend more than you could afford its only money and you will make more. Patience to all who are worried. ",29,2018-01-16 18:52:47,11
USDT,Altcoin,"Looking for an exchange which allows ""range stop loss""","What I mean by ""range stop loss"": Suppose bitcoin is valued at 10,000 USDT. You buy at this price, and want to sell if the price goes beyond 10400 or the price falls to 9600, i.e sell if price <= 9600 or price >= 10400. 

Binance which I use only allows one or the other, i.e sell if price <= 9600 or sell if price >= 10400 but not both. 
Kraken I know had something similar (trailing stop orders) but had since deactivated it.

USDT,Altcoin,WAVES news and updates,"**Waves (WAVES),** one of the top 50 currencies jumped  more than 11% on Tuesday, 19th Dec. It was caused by the most recent announcement of  virtual asset exchange Huobi. In the news it was  announced that Tether (USDT) support for WAVES assets in its international and Korean markets. 

 Huobi Global added **WAVES** paired with USDT at 10:00 UTC on Tuesday, saying the the coin will meet its Tether listing standards.  It is needed to mention that Korean Market  supports BTC and ETH trading for WAVES as well.

Of course, such news played its role and had an effect on the perfomance of WAVES . The price of it rose from $2.61 several minutes before the Huobi Global listing to $2.64 around 30 minutes later. The asset sustained its momentum and changed hands at $2.70 at 11:17 UTC, which was an 11.03% increase on a daily basis, as per Coinmarketcap data. WAVES clocked $25.9 million in trading volume in the last 24 hours, with Binance BTC, ETH, and Binance Coin (BNB) markets accounting for 45.5% of it, or $13.1 million. Trading in BTC and Ethereum amounted to $459,414 (1.6%).

At the moment,  **WAVES** ranks at number 21 on the cryptocurrency market capitalization list with $271.2 million in value.  

Therefore, I would say now it is pretty good time for looking more closely at this altcoin and it going straight to the green zone, strengthening its positions as possible.Expecting the range in the next 24 hours  of **$3,47-4.**

USDT,Altcoin,HUOBI LAUNCHES NEW CRYPTO MARKET INDEX - HUOBI 10,"Huobi, which is one of the top 3 cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, announced that they will be launching a new crypto market index called Huobi 10

According to a press release, Huobi 10 will track 10 different digital assets traded against tether \(USDT\), a dollar\-pegged cryptocurrency, on its platform in real time. This will allow the index to “reflect the overall performance of Huobi Pro market,"" enabling investors to get an aggregated feed rather than having to check on individual assets one at a time.

**COMPOSITION OF HUOBI 10 INDEX**

The list includes Bitcoin \(25.96&#37;\), Huobi Token \(25.57&#37;\), EOS \(15.57&#37;\), Ethereum \(12.30&#37;\), Bitcoin Cash \(5.55&#37;\), XRP \(4.30&#37;\), LTC \(3.31&#37;\), IOST \(3.02&#37;\), Ethereum Classic \(2.57&#37;\), Dash \(1.82&#37;\)

You can check out Huobi’s official release here: [https://www.huobi.pro/huobi\_index/](https://www.huobi.pro/huobi_index/)

**Maintaining Alpha Through High Performance**  

According to the historical data from March to May, the alpha of Huobi 10 Index compared to BTC is \-0.0028, while the beta of the index based on BTC is 0.79. And to top it off, Huobi 10 Index has scored well against Bitcoin \(BTC\) as well. This proves that Huobi 10 Index is effective in maintaining alpha while suppressing volatility.

**A Whole New World Of Financial Products**

With the creation of the Huobi 10 Index, Huobi is opening the gates to a host of blockchain financial products like crypto ETFs and blockchain derivative products. And the wait isn't too long either as these are expected to be released as soon as early June.

Earlier this year, with the launch of bitcoin futures there was talk of bitcoin indexes and bitcoin ETFs being launched. Huobi aims to bring investors one step closer to this with Huobi 10 and the crypto ETFs and financial products based on it.

Truly exciting times are ahead of us.",7,2018-05-29 13:11:36,1
USDT,Altcoin,Looking to begin purchasing altcoins,"I'm looking to get into buying and selling altcoins for cash. The further I look into it, the more questions I have. What I'm trying to do is buy and sell altcoins against fiat money, primarily the USD. I've looked around for exchanges and came across HitBTC which has a slew of altcoins to buy from.

Now, concerning the selling process. It does not seem like I can sell altcoins on that exchange and then withdraw them for USD. It doesn't even seem like I can purchase altcoins with USD directly. It seems like I may need to purchase Tether (USDT) to then begin trading against that. I'm just wondering if I'm completely off track or if I'm correct to assume this so far. Also, is there another exchange with a good amount of altcoins like HitBTC? I've seen some bad things coming from that exchange concerning losing BTC and money.

I'm looking for altcoins mainly because of the daily fluctuations and low price point to begin trading. Does it seem feasible to purchase USDT (Tether) to purchase altcoins then sell the altcoins after it increases for more USDT (Tether), then convert the Tether to USD for use. I'm mainly looking for quick turnarounds.",1,2017-11-10 17:59:46,3

I have made crypto news integration into slack workspace.
Main purpose is to have notifications in mobile phone.
So you are always up to date.
Great advantage of slack is that you have option to setup notification for keywords.

News are from CryptoPanic web, but I can integrate any other source.
channel: #news

Also there is channel for alerts from tradingview screener.
Signal is when SMA50 goes under SMA200.
Very helpful for finding oportunities.
channel: #long_runner

Also there is channel for USDT price movement. Some people like to be notified about USDT.
channel: #USDT

I've also integrated free signals form CryptoPing.

- What is the TPCash?

TPCash is a new cryptocurrency that aimed to make the circulation and transfer of currency between countries easier and more convenient. This also makes the trade and exchange of commodity between countries simpler by reducing documents and fees. TPC coins can be converted to major cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.

- TPCash eco-system:

Consists of six core elements: TPCash coin trading exchange, peer to peer exchange, TPCash wallet, TPC Debit card, TPCash coin mining and Tpcash commerce. The TPC coin Debit card will allow users to spend their coins anywhere VISA or Mastercard are accepted. Users will use the card to shop online, swipe at stores and withdraw cash from ATMs worldwwide. The card will be usable in any country that accepts VISA and mastercard, and will have no hidden fees.
The wallet will be available on iOS, Android, Mac OS and Windows. It will be easy to use the same wallet or accounts across multiple devices.

- Our planing is to introducing TPCash coin on Poliniex, C-cex, Coinexchange, Bittrex, coinmarketcap and other exchange.

# Introduction

*BabyTether is a new token in the Binance Smart Chain network, which allows each holder to receive permanent passive earnings, paid in $USDT.*

*What could be more stable and more confident than receiving rewards immediately in $?*

*Every week, tokens appear that pay rewards to holders in the form of other tokens (BNB, CAKE, ADA, AVAX, Dogecoin and so on). You depend at once on the price of two tokens: on the token that you are holding and on the other token in which you are credited with rewards. Of course, you can immediately sell the second token and convert it into dollars, but these are unnecessary actions, an unnecessary waste of attention and inconvenience. Especially if you are relaxing somewhere on the islands, drinking Pina Colada. Or you can hold the token that you receive as a reward, but this is an additional risk. The risk of the market falling, respectively, of this token.*

*Our team really likes the idea of ​​projects that pay rewards to holders immediately in the form of stablecoins (USDT, BUSD). But in reality, there are very few such high-quality projects on the market. That is why we are here!*

*Think about it. Why do you need extra actions? Why do you need additional risk, which is already enough in cryptocurrency? We do not see the need for this and are more inclined towards stability, to constancy. And there is nothing more stable in cryptocurrency than stablecoins. Regardless of the market, whether it goes up or down, you will always know that you have dollars in your portfolio that you can always use in real life. Better yet, when the market falling, you will have the funds to buy back the altcoins (which other projects offer you as rewards, haha) at even lower prices.*

*BabyTeather is not just a meme token, without functionality. Our team wants to make a great story out of this project. Something like BabyDogeCoin.. A wonderful project and wonderful admins. And we intend to repeat their success, but in a much more stable and acceptable form for ordinary people.*

*If you give a choice to an ordinary person who is not very familiar with cryptocurrency to buy a coin and receive rewards for it in CAKE/BNB/Dogecoin.. or in $, what will he choose? The answer is obvious. And our mission is to distribute BabyTether not in a narrowly focused way only in the cryptocurrency community, but by embracing a large number of ordinary people who are just starting to study the cryptocurrency world.*

# Features

# Dividend Distribution Mechanism

The dividend mechanism incentivizes token holders to hold in order to earn dividends from the transactions (buys and sells).

    The dividends are not dependent on the price of BabyTether. They are based purely on the volume and proportional to the BabyTether amount you hold in your wallet.

* All $USDT the contract gains are split proportionally between the token holders
* To receive dividends a minimum token balance of 200,000 BabyTether is required to be held in a wallet
* The contract keeps track of all the dividends due to each holder in a list
* Every transaction processes a certain number of users from the list
* The number of holders processed through each transaction is dynamic and based on transaction size
* Holders will receive dividends from the queue based on their position in the list
* It’s a fair system, fully automated

# Security

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Binance's decision will benefit Tether.,"JPMorgan says Binance's decision to automatically convert USDC deposits to BUSD could make Tether even more important when it comes to trading.Tethers' massive daily trading volumes represent a serious opportunity, according to the report.

Analysts at JPMorgan Chase say Binance's recent stablecoin decision will benefit Tether.

Starting September 29, Binance will convert existing balances and new deposits of USDC, USDP and TUSD stablecoins to its own BUSD stablecoin. In addition, it will end trading in pairs for the three stablecoins against BUSD and Tether (USDT), as well as major cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH.

In particular, JPMorgan believes that this decision will increase the importance of Tether in cryptocurrency trading.

""In our view, this decision is likely to strengthen Tether's importance in the stablecoin world, which has been threatened by USDC,"" the analysts wrote in a research note on Wednesday.

The investment bank noted that Tether's share of the market capitalization of the stablecoin ecosystem has been declining over the past 18 months. Using this metric, the importance of the stablecoin diminishes, the bank argued.

It is also important to see that blockchain finance with platforms like Ovenue, AValone and the like is advancing at the fastest pace and is at the forefront of all cryptocurrencies.",1,2022-09-16 17:24:13,2

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Is Tether reliable as stablecoin? How can you earn with Tether?,"A lot of questions about stablecoins, particularly one called Tether, have been going around in financial circles for months: are they as stable as they ought to be? A group of people have raised questions about Tether as a possible systemic risk to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. On August 9th, Tether put out an attestation about its reserves, a way of reassuring users that the most popular stablecoin is, well, stable.

Instantaneous unregulated funds transfers without exchange rate risk. ... Using non-stable crypto currencies introduces exchange rate risk in transfers, therefore Tether can be seen as a safer way to complete short term funds transfers. The risk is that if Tether's price suddenly collapses, those transfers could fail, which is in fact highly unlikely.

While Tether is not necessarily a long-term investment that will grow your money by itself, because it stays pegged to the U.S. dollar. There are other stablecoins that do have growing potential and of course newer coins like Shiba, Mimirtoken or Atpay for example that are small and have growing potential. There are however lending platforms, exchanges and wallets that will pay you high interest rates to store USDT on their platform.",5,2021-11-09 21:15:44,1

**PRESALE LAUNCH ANNOUNCEMENT**

**We’ve raised approximately 250 BNB to date.  There is only 78 BNB left to raise, period, and it’s going fast. We are also allocating a portion of this 78 BNB to a launchpad (announced today in our TG) for additional exposure.  When this allocation is gone, it’s gone, and after that it will have to be purchased post launch.**

**Visit** [https://t.me/PumpOfficialGroup](https://t.me/PumpOfficialGroup) **to get all the details!**

**PUMP Token**

$PMP is a revolutionary new token that is the first in ALL of DeFi to pair 75% of xSurge's $xUSD in LP as a backing asset. $xUSD is a stablecoin that only appreciates in value, giving pumptoken a unique stability unlike anything else seen on the BNB Smart Chain. A potentially revolutionary investment, Pump Token will  be a technology demonstrator for the future of decentralized stablecoin backed assets.  For a primer on $xUSD and what it is, visit buytherise.com

**WTF is $xUSD?**

$xUSD is DeFi's first ever appreciating and decentralized stablecoin that never goes down in price. Buys, sells and transfers all RAISE the price.  Interestingly, because of the wrapping mechanism inherent in $xUSD, buys and transfers raise the price linearly, however, selling the token actually raises the price exponentially.

$xUSD's real-world utilities generate revenue on its own via staking, lending, yield farming, mining, and arbitrage. These utilities create a paradigm shift from immediate price action to a sustained base APY that appreciates over time, all while abiding by XSurge's core truths:

* Every Buy, Sell Or Transfer Raises The Price
* Over 100% Liquidity Backing

$xUSD cannot be compared to a stablecoin like Tether.  $xUSD is fully collateralized, and it’s immutable.  For example, if 100 people bought $xUSD, and then 99 of them sold, the last man standing would not only walk out with full value, but would walk out with the best price.  Ironically (and quite extraordinarily) a huge selloff of $xUSD would cause the price to go parabolic in the upwards direction.The characteristics of $xUSD make it the PERFECT token to back ANY project on the BSC.  No matter what is happening with $PMP, $xUSD will always be going up in the background.  This is vitally important because ALL tokens go through bearish stretches and low volume periods.  $xUSD is the hedge against a down market and low volume.

**Why Buy Pump?**

**1. $xUSD backing and rewards:**

In addition to being backed 75% by $xUSD, $PMP gives 50% of all tax revenue back to our holders in $xUSD rewards.The longer you hold $PMP, the more rewards you will accumulate.  And getting rewarded in a token that cannot fall in price increases the incentive to keep on stacking those rewards and creating passive income.

$PMP is the FIRST token to pair such an extraordinary amount of LP in $xUSD, but it will not be the last.  Within a couple years, $xUSD will be THE premiere backing asset in all of the BSC.  $PMP holders will be the beneficiaries of every single project that uses $xUSD after it.

**2. Arbitrage:**

$PMP will launch with TWO liquidity pools!  Why?  Because we can profit off of price balancing between the two pools (arbitrage).

Our exclusive PumpBot (powered by XSurge’s Arbie) will be FEE EXEMPT, and will arbitrage the two pools 24/7.  90% of all arbitraged profits are returned back to $PMP.  This is an external revenue source for $PMP that will not require the token to be actively traded.  We can use that money for advertising, giveaways, buy and burns, wherever we feel the money can be deployed best….and the service is FREE for us, we pay nothing to use it.

**3.  The Pumpstarter:**

The Pumpstarter is our exclusive Treausry deployment model.  We will allow our own community to participate in deciding the future direction of $PMP!  The community is a HUGE part of $PMP’s identity, and we want them actively engaged in deciding the best deployment of the Treasury’s funds.

Initially, all Treasury funds will be housed in $xUSD for safekeeping, so the Treasury will begin to grow right at launch.

**4.  Future projects:**

Although we cannot divulge exactly what’s next in store for $PMP, we are actively working on the next three or four phases of the project.  The whole game doesn’t begin and end with the launch of $PMP.  $PMP is just the beginning.

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Are we giving enough attention to stablecoins?,"This is a foregone conclusion. To be honest, I'm not sure why people aren't embracing and appreciating the new way of life that blockchain platforms provide. We went years without the Internet because no one anticipated that we would need it before it was established. With blockchain and cryptocurrency, the same will be true

One of the most significant topics after BTC, in my opinion, is stablecoins. I feel we are not paying them enough attention, and they are entitled to a lot more. The only articles I've found on stablecoins include the USDT controversy, however, if you're not satisfied with Tether because of it, there are many more stablecoins to consider, such as BUSD, DAI, or BEAN.

Well-designed and regulated stablecoins might have a huge influence on our payment system, the same can be applied to BTC. However, rules must be in place to ensure ethical usage and innovation.

At the end of the day, no matter how long it takes for people to adopt blockchain platforms, they will be used by everyone. I'd want to hear what you have to say about it.",11,2022-04-08 20:09:32,14

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Crypto Payment Apps will Expedite Mainstream Adoption," I have to put it out there; for years, I wasn't sure that the whole concept of cryptocurrency was for me, but with everything that happened in the stock market during the pandemic, I decided to take a leap of faith and let me tell you, it was 100% worth it. For those of you who are new to the concept of ""cryptocurrency,"" the following few sentences are for you. It is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology- a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. Furthermore, they enable secure online payments without using a third-party mediator.

Additionally, cryptocurrencies can be mined or purchased from cryptocurrency exchanges. With that said, not all e-commerce sites allow purchases using cryptocurrencies. In fact, cryptocurrencies, even popular ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are hardly used for retail transactions.

That said, Gucci is taking the leap of faith and joining the crypto crowd. The brand will start accepting cryptocurrency payments in some US stores at the end of the month and plans to extend the pilot to all its directly-operated North American stores this summer. This extraordinary move marks a significant validation for the currency from a leading luxury brand. In-store crypto payments will be made with a link sent via email to the customer; once opened, they will find a QR code that will allow them to execute the payment from their crypto wallet. Gucci will accept payments in more than ten currencies, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Wrapped Bitcoin, Litecoin, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and five stable coins pegged to the US dollar.

Crypto payments are usually accepted in physical space through a QR code or NFC reader on an existing point of sale terminal that connects with a customer's smartphone cryptocurrency app, similar to mobile credit card payments. A retailer can automatically convert the payment to fiat currency, such as US dollars, or keep the payments in cryptocurrency.

As different businesses are slowly joining this up-and-coming concept, we can probably expect to notice several apps with a similar idea to Venmo. Personally, I came across one such company--Oobit-after reading their recent PR on a new mobile payments app for crypto. Oobit first launched in 2017 to increase cryptocurrency adoption in everyday life, and are registered in APAC, the EU, and Israel--all hot spots of mainstream crypto adoption I might add. In a nutshell, Oobit offers a fast and easy way to pay individuals and also businesses. They've got a utility token, OBT, for use inside the Oobit ecosystem. The idea behind this unique concept is that anyone in the world can send and receive crypto payments in seconds with 0 fees, which is pretty revolutionary given the current constraints on cross-border payments, fiat on/off-ramps, crazy fees and wait times, etc.

If that's not an advantage and unique feature, how about their up-and-coming concept of an Oobit's Visa card that acts a bank card that allows you to withdraw cash from ATMs worldwide. Also, when spending through a standard debit card, your digital assets are sold and connected to fiat, triggering a taxable event. The Oobit Visa card allows you to pay without selling your crypto; hence no taxable event will occur. Additionally, you can buy and track more than 35 types of crypto while also managing your balance on the go. In other words, this company seems to on the right track in bringing a tangible payment PRODUCT to market, a relative rarity these days for the broader crypto market aswim with shell ICOs and hype but no actual business so to speak of.

Based on everything mentioned herein, there is no doubt that we are slowly entering a new era of crypto payment apps and purchasing via cryptocurrencies. I mention one new name here--Oobit--this is responding precisely to this market gap. They've got an interesting product on the market and I'm looking forward to where their project, alongside those of competitors, end up going. But at the end of the day I genuinely believe that Gucci's move points to the start of a new trend where consumers want the ability to make payments for anything and everything, from rent to gas to bubblegum, in crypto. As the crypto world absorbs and bounces back from the Luna/Terra/Tether debacle, its companies like Oobit--properly registered, have a legitimate product, play by the rules--that will come out on top.",27,2022-05-15 14:17:21,9

KPIs are used to evaluate a company's performance or a specific activity that it participates in. The value of such performance metrics may be demonstrated in the regular decision-making processes of business leaders.

 A decision-maker must have a thorough understanding of the current situation in order to foresee the consequences of future actions while weighing a variety of possibilities.

 As a result, using performance indicators to reduce risk and eliminate errors is necessary. I discovered a fantastic firm that uses behavioral data to assist businesses in identifying target groups across many blockchains in order to provide the best possible user experience. 

I believe that more precisely targeted marketing to certain segments will help Ludo's clients.

[Synthetix (SNX)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/synthetix-network-token) $3.05

What Is Synthetix (SNX)?

Website: [synthetix.io](https://synthetix.io/)

Synthetix is a decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)) protocol that provides on-chain exposure to a wide variety of crypto and non-crypto assets. The protocol is based on the Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) blockchain and offers users access to highly liquid synthetic assets (synths). Synths track and provide returns on the underlying asset without requiring one to directly hold the asset.

The platform aims to broaden the cryptocurrency space by introducing non-blockchain assets, providing access to a more robust financial market.

Who Are the Founders of Synthetix?

The network was launched in September 2017 by Kain Warwick under the name Havven (HAV). About a year later the company rebranded to Synthetix.

Kain Warwick is the founder of Synthetix and a non-executive director at the blueshyft retail network. Prior to founding Synthetix, Warwick has worked on several other cryptocurrency projects. He also founded Pouncer, a live auction site exclusive to Australia.

Peter McKean, the project’s CEO, has over two decades of experience in software development. He previously worked as a programmer at ICL Fujitsu.

Jordan Momtazi, the COO of Synthetix, is a business strategist, market analyst and sales leader with several years of experience in blockchain, cryptocurrency, digital payments and e-commerce systems.

Justin J. Moses, the CTO, was the former director of engineering at MongoDB and deputy practice head of engineering at Lab49. He also co-founded Pouncer.

What Makes Synthetix Unique?

Synthetix is a decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-decentralized-exchanges-dex)) and a platform for synthetic assets. The protocol is designed in a way that exposes users to the underlying assets via synths, without having to hold the underlying asset.

The platform allows users to autonomously trade and exchange synths. It also has a staking pool where holders can stake their SNX tokens and are rewarded with a share of the transaction fees on the Synthetix Exchange.

The platform tracks the underlying assets using smart contract price delivery protocols called oracles. Synthetix allows users to trade synths seamlessly, without liquidity/slippage issues. It also eliminates the need for [third-party](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-dao) facilitators.

SNX tokens are used as collateral for the synthetic assets that are minted. This means that whenever synths are issued, SNX tokens are locked up in a smart contract.

Since launch, the protocol has transitioned to the Optimistic Ethereum mainnet to help reduce the gas fees on the network and lower oracle latency.

How Many Synthetix (SNX) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The circulating supply of SNX is 236,567,378 coins. At the seed round and token sale stages, Synthetix sold more than 60 million tokens and was able to raise $30 million. Of the total 100,000,000 coins issued during the ICO, 20% was allocated to the team and advisors, 3% to bounties and marketing incentives, 5% to partnership incentives and 12% to the foundation.

Where Can You Buy Synthetix (SNX)?

SNX tokens can be purchased at top exchanges, such as: [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/), [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/), [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/)

[Nexo (NEXO)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nexo) $1.08

What Is Nexo (NEXO)?

Website: [nexo.io](https://nexo.io/)

Nexo is a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain)\-based lending platform that offers users instant [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies)\-backed loans. Users deposit an accepted token — such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC), [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) (ETH), [Litecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/) (LTC) or [XRP](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/) (XRP) — as collateral to receive a loan in the form of a fiat currency or [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin).

Nexo has a native token, NEXO, that when locked in the platform grants users benefits such as discounts on interest accumulated on loans and the opportunity to receive interest payments on funds deposited. Token holders also receive dividends from Nexo's profits.

The project was first [announced](https://medium.com/nexo/nexobank-get-instant-loans-secured-by-digital-assets-2d04c75d25ac) in December 2017, and it [launched](https://medium.com/nexo/nexo-launches-platform-and-worlds-first-instant-crypto-backed-loans-442b029cca8f) in April 2018.

Who Are the Founders of Nexo?

[Nexo](https://nexo.io/) was founded by a team of finance professionals and crypto enthusiasts, who turned to blockchain to create the crypto equivalent to a service well established in traditional finance, but hitherto non-existent in digital finance— borrowing against the value of your assets while retaining ownership. In 2018, the team launched the Nexo platform, offering the world’s first crypto credit lines that allowed digital asset holders to obtain fiat and stablecoin loans against their cryptocurrency, and thus setting the foundations of the crypto lending niche.

The collective behind Nexo has a combined experience of over 30 years in financial services, including non-crypto lending, investment banking, mergers and acquisitions, and hedge funds, with Co-founder and Managing Partner [Antoni Trenchev](https://twitter.com/antroninexo) additionally contributing with experience in Finance Law and in KYC and AML solutions.

Trenchev, who has acted as the public face of Nexo’s leadership, has a track record in advocating for wider blockchain and crypto adoption, notably serving as member of parliament in Bulgaria’s National Assembly from 2015 to 2017, where he promoted the implementation of blockchain solutions for e-government services, as well as frequently commenting on crypto and digital finance-related current events to mainstream media, including [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-12-11/bitcoin-foundations-are-firm-says-nexo-s-antoni-trenchev-video), [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/bitcoin-price-all-time-high-record-b1761235.html), and [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/06/25/hard-for-cryptocurrency-doubters-to-continue-their-cause-expert.html).

Nexo currently services over a million users across 200+ jurisdictions, managing over $4 billion in assets. The company currently has 150 employees, with its management based in London.

What Makes Nexo Unique?

According to its [whitepaper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper), Nexo is the [first-ever](https://nexo.io/assets/downloads/Nexo-Whitepaper.pdf) provider of instant cryptocurrency-backed loans and it intends to solve inefficiencies in the lending market. Its automated lending process uses [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) and an [oracle](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/oracles-in-defi-101-a-deep-dive-by-tellor) on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain to manage loans. After a user transfers cryptocurrency to a Nexo-controlled wallet, the oracle establishes the loan and the user is instantly allocated the funds. When the user makes a deposit in order to repay the loan, the oracle returns the cryptocurrency and records the transaction on the blockchain. Smart contracts are used to power NEXO and to record user balances.

Nexo is [marketed](https://nexo.io/assets/downloads/Business-Overview.pdf) to individual and institutional investors, cryptocurrency companies, exchanges, miners and others who want [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) from their assets. The company makes a profit from the interest accumulated on loans, and it also offers institutional lending and consulting services.

Nexo seeks to build a user base of clients that continue to use the platform and remain invested in NEXO. As such, the company announced a loyalty program that rewards those who keep NEXO in their accounts, giving them preferential interest rates on [loans](https://nexo.io/blog/the-loyalty-program-and-how-it-benefits-you-part-1-better-borrowing) and higher yields on [savings](https://nexo.io/blog/the-loyalty-program-and-how-it-benefits-you-part-2-dynamic-passive-income). Nexo also [distributes](https://medium.com/nexo/nexo-dividends-explained-6636804db3a) 30% of its profits to NEXO token holders in the form of dividends.

Nexo has a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens. Of this amount, the circulating supply stands at 560,000,010 according to [coingecko.com](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nexo)

While Nexo initially planned to have a public presale and main token sale, it later [canceled](https://medium.com/nexo/update-on-the-nexo-token-sale-995e9c21e22b) its public sales due to an overwhelming amount of interest from investors in its private sale.

In October 2020, the company [announced](https://medium.com/nexo/dispatch-8-nexo-invites-you-to-tokenup-with-nexonomics-bdcb9ef9e38d) that it was launching a ""Nexonomics"" initiative to drive its [tokenomics](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics) and increase the value of NEXO. The company subsequently [revealed](https://nexo.io/blog/nexo-launches-12-million-dollar-buyback-program) that it would buy back $12 million worth of NEXO.

Where Can You Buy Nexo (NEXO)?

NEXO can be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges such as [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [UPEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/upex/), [Hoo](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hoo/) and [Bitrue](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitrue/), among others. It can be traded against fiat currencies such as the South Korean won and the Indian rupee, cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) (BTC) and [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum) (ETH), and the stablecoin [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT).

[NEAR Protocol (NEAR)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/near) $4.22

What Is NEAR Protocol (NEAR)?

Website: [near.org](https://near.org/)

[NEAR Protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/near-protocol/) is a [layer-one blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) that was designed as a community-run cloud computing platform and that eliminates some of the limitations that have been bogging competing blockchains, such as low transaction speeds, low throughput and poor interoperability. This provides the ideal environment for [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/de/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) and creates a developer and user-friendly platform. For instance, NEAR uses human-readable account names, unlike the cryptographic wallet addresses common to [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). NEAR also introduces unique solutions to scaling problems and has its own [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism) called “Doomslug.”

NEAR Protocol is being built by the NEAR Collective, its community that is updating the initial code and releasing updates to the ecosystem. Its declared goal is to build a platform that is “secure enough to manage high value assets like money or identity and performant enough to make them useful for everyday people.”

[Flux](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zel/), a protocol that allows developers to create markets based on assets, commodities, real-world events, and Mintbase, an [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) minting platform are examples of projects being built on NEAR Protocol.

Who Are the Founders of NEAR Protocol (NEAR)?

NEAR Protocol was founded by Erik Trautman, an entrepreneur with experience on Wall Street and founder of Viking Education. His co-founders were Illia Polosukhin, who has more than ten years of industry experience, including three years at Google, and Alexander Skidanov, a computer scientist that worked at Microsoft and went on to join memSQL, where he became the director of engineering. NEAR Protocol has an extensive team of experienced developers that includes several International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) gold medalists and winners. The team claims to have people with experience of building some of the only real-world sharded systems at scale, a solution the protocol is pursuing to improve blockchain scalability.

What Makes NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Unique?

NEAR uses its Nightshade technology to improve transaction throughput massively. Nightshade is a variation of [sharding](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/sharding), in which individual sets of validators process transactions in parallel across multiple sharded chains, improving the overall capacity of the blockchain. In contrast to “regular” sharding, shards in Nightshade produce a fraction of the next block, called “chunks.” In doing so, NEAR Protocol is able to achieve up to 100,000 transactions per second and achieve near-instant transaction finality thanks to a one-second block cadence while simultaneously keeping transaction fees at virtually zero.

NEAR Protocol also improves upon the convoluted onboarding process of other blockchains by having human-readable addresses and building decentralized applications with similar registration flow to what users have already experienced. Moreover, it provides developers with modular components, helping them start projects like token contracts or NFTs more quickly.

Near Protocol Ecosystem Fund

On Oct. 25, 2021, NEAR [announced](https://near.org/blog/near-announces-800-million-in-funding-initiatives-to-support-ecosystem-growth/) a $800 million in ecosystem funding initiatives, following in the footsteps of various [Layer-1s](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) blockchains like [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/), [Fantom](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fantom/) and [Celo](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celo/). The fund will be used to bankroll initiatives that will focus on accelerating growth in the NEAR protocol ecosystem. The fund includes $350 million in funding from Proximity Labs. Out of the total fund, $250 million will be used to help existing projects scale, and $100 million will be allocated to the Startup Grant Pools, where 20 startups will be given $5M each. NEAR will focus on funding [Decentralized Finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) (DeFi) focused teams that are “actively revolutionizing and reimagining the way we interact with money.” NEAR is also actively looking for projects building on [NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token), [DAOs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) and gaming. On a separate note, NEAR recently raised $150 million in seed investment led by Three Arrows Capital, with additional participation from Mechanism Capital, Dragonfly Capital, a16z, Jump, Alameda, Zee Prime and more. This will be used to accelerate the adoption of [Web3](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/web-3-0) technologies.

[Terra Classic (LUNC)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-classic-wormhole) $0.0002385

What Is Terra Classic (LUNC)?

Website:[ terra.money](https://www.terra.money/)

Terra is a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) protocol that uses fiat-pegged [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) to power price-stable global payments systems. According to its white paper, Terra combines the price stability and wide adoption of fiat currencies with the censorship-resistance of [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) (BTC) and offers fast and affordable settlements.

Development on Terra began in January 2018, and its mainnet officially launched in April 2019. As of September 2021, it [offers](https://medium.com/terra-money/announcing-terrausd-ust-the-interchain-stablecoin-53eab0f8f0ac) stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar, South Korean won, Mongolian tugrik and the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights basket of currencies — and it intends to roll out additional options.

On May 28, 2022, the genesis block of the new chain was launched to conduct future transactions under the name [Terra (LUNA)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna-v2/), and the original Terra Chain was rebranded as Terra Classic. The original native token — LUNA has also been renamed as LUNA Classic (LUNC). Moreover, all network [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin) (UST, KRT, EUT) have been renamed to Terra Classic stablecoins (USTC, KRTC, EUTC). There will be no Terra stablecoins on the new chain.

There is a theory that the additional term “classic” is a reference to the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) / [Ethereum Classic](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-classic/) split in 2017. According to CEO, Do Kwon, the collapse of UST in the spring of 2022 is the equivalent moment of the Ethereum’s [DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) hack that took place in 2017.

What Is Luna Classic (LUNC)?

Luna Classic (LUNC) is the first native token of Terra blockchain released in August 2018. $LUNC existed before the launch of the new chain — now branded Terra (LUNA) — and works with the original code of the Terra ecosystem.

The main function that the native token performed was to absorb the price deviation of the [algorithmic stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/algorithmic-stablecoin) — $UST. The price of the UST stablecoin was pegged to the US dollar by minting and burning UST tokens to balance the supply and demand of the coin. In May 2022, UST lost its peg and collapsed. The UST stablecoin algorithm created trillions of LUNA tokens, fell into a hyperinflationary spiral, and reduced the value of the original LUNA token by 99%.

Read: [The full breakdown of the Terra Crash](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/are-algorithmic-stablecoins-dead-already-a-full-breakdown-of-the-terra-crash)

What is the difference between Terra (LUNA) and Terra Classic (LUNC)?

Both versions of the token have the right to exist as a result of the implementation of a proposal called Terra Ecosystem Revival Plan 2. The essence of the plan is to split the current blockchain through [forking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fork-blockchain), which created a new chain in the ecosystem, preserving the previous version.

According to the recovery plan, the existing chain and token have been rebranded as Terra Classic. The new LUNA tokens were [airdropped](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/airdrop) to existing holders of LUNA and UST before the depeg and subsequent crash occurred.

Who Are the Founders of Terra Classic?

Terra was founded in January 2018 by Daniel Shin and Do Kwon. The two [conceived](https://medium.com/kucoinexchange/kucoin-ama-series-terra-luna-full-transcript-a3019e664195) of the project as a way to drive the rapid adoption of blockchain technology and [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) through a focus on price stability and usability. Kwon took on the position of CEO of Terraform Labs, the company behind Terra.

Prior to developing Terra, Shin [co-founded](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201112/the-returnees.html) and headed Ticket Monster, otherwise known as TMON — a major South Korean e-commerce platform. He later [co-founded](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2020/03/133_162546.html) Fast Track Asia, a startup incubator working with entrepreneurs to build fully functional companies.

Kwon previously founded and served as CEO of Anyfi, a startup providing decentralized wireless mesh networking solutions. He has also worked as a software engineer for Microsoft and Apple.

What Makes Terra Classic Unique?

Terra seeks to set itself apart through its use of fiat-pegged stablecoins, stating that it combines the borderless benefits of cryptocurrencies with the day-to-day price stability of fiat currencies. It keeps its one-to-one peg through an algorithm that automatically adjusts stablecoin supply based on its demand. It does so by incentivizing LUNA holders to swap LUNA and stablecoins at profitable exchange rates, as needed, to either expand or contract the stablecoin supply to match demand.

Terra has established a number of partnerships with payments platforms, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. In July 2019, Terra [announced](https://medium.com/terra-money/terra-partners-with-mobile-payment-app-chai-29c593f0a364) a partnership with Chai, a South Korea-based mobile payments application, in which purchases made using the application on e-commerce platforms are processed via the Terra blockchain network. Each transaction is subject to (on average) a 2%–3% fee charged to the merchant.

In addition, Terra is supported by the Terra Alliance, a group of businesses and platforms advocating for the adoption of Terra. In February 2019, the company [announced](https://medium.com/terra-money/state-of-the-terra-alliance-d7f3ff8f6411) that e-commerce platforms from 10 different countries, representing a user base of 45 million and a gross merchandise value of $25 billion, were members of the alliance.

Terra Classic's Role for UST

The LUNA token and [UST](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terrausd/) are mutually dependent, as the success of the [Terra ecosystem](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-terra-a-guide-to-terra-s-ecosystem) is a function of the adoption of UST as a [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin). LUNA backs UST and is burned when demand for UST rises. Following upgrades like [Columbus-5](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/columbus-5-is-almost-here-what-does-that-mean-for-terra-and-its-users-flipside-crypto), the supply of LUNA could become highly deflationary in the long run.

On the flip side, the value of LUNA can also decrease if UST is perceived as unstable. UST briefly lost its peg following the Wormhole hack, leading to a temporary price crash for LUNA.

In May 2022, a series of liquidations and bank runs from investors pulling their funds out saw UST Classic depeg to as low as $0.044. LUNA Classic crashed over 99% from over $80. UST Classic never recovered its peg.

He revealed in February 2021 that he had acquired $1.5 billion in BTC and intended to accept it as payment, prompting the company's shares and foreign currency to rise. However, Musk then changed his decision, leading Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to lose value.   
 

How about DOGE, for instance? Speculators have purchased Dogecoin due to Musk's ""obsession with cryptocurrencies"" and the chance that Dogecoin may be used more widely on one of the many major social media sites. Or is it possible that it's not all about Musk? If you want volatility and the potential for large returns, you'll need fresh ventures like it. It's possible that finding projects like these is difficult, but I've been following a handful of them for a while now, and CoinFantasy, QREDO, and ROSE have gotten the most of my attention.   
 

What do you believe DOGE's prospects are?",14,2022-05-01 20:44:44,5

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,EverIncome Coin| |Whitelisted Presale in 7 days| 8% BUSD Rewards Token| Multi-Utility with Passive Income | Team To Be Kyc'ed | Platform Live Before Launch | Big Marketing Coming | BSC Token,"**What is EverIncome Coin?**

EIC is a hyper deflationary token that rewards you passive income with $BUSD reflections. Besides $BUSD rewards, EverIncome is creating an ecosystem that brings the best of Defi to our community.

All holders of $EIC will earn an 8% reward from every Buy/Transfer/Sell Transaction in Binance pegged USD ($BUSD), which is automatically sent to your wallet. This generates a stable passive income for all holders, which they will receive every month.

There are various strategies in place to decrease the supply of EverIncome Coin over time, meaning individual holdings will become more valuable and receive a higher proportion of rewards.

Via BuyBack & Burn, 2% $EIC is collected from every transaction and converted to BNB, which are stored in the contract. When BuyBack & Burn is enabled, the contract purchases $EIC directly from exchanges, driving the price up, and immediately and permanently removes those purchased tokens from circulating supply by sending them to the contract ‘Burn’ address. This means less circulating supply, so a higher share of rewards paid to holders.

There are great benefits for being a EverIncome holder – like our unique revenue model and our social platform like facebook. In addition, our token metrics provide for a 8% BUSD reflections or rewards. With the above model, it’s hard not to feel excited about the future of EverIncome and your holdings. 

**Our products**

1. EIC Social, a facebook-like social platform with an engage-to-earn system that rewards members who engage with their friends and with the community; imagine getting passive income for every like, post, comment you make on the platform. The product aims to be ready before launch.
2. NFT Marketplace, it will be an NFT marketplace built on BSC focusing highly on user experience and ease of use to create, buy, sell and trade NFTs.The product will be developed in 2022 Q2 and launched in 2022 Q3.
3. Play-To-Earn, it will be a shooting game similar to Counter-Strike, where users can buy and sell weapons, equipments and earn EIC tokens from tournaments, you will need some EIC tokens for the game. This is a great way to create utility for EIC itself.The product will be developed in 2022 Q3 and launched in 2023 Q1.

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"APR, APY and MIDAS Boost | Which One is More Profitable?","**Simple Interest Rate and APR**

**APR** is one concept that is used to describe the interest which can be expected on any crypto investment on an annual basis. The term APR itself stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is an easier term to comprehend between APR and APY because APR is simple. It refers to the basic annual rate of return paid in interest. Annual Percentage Rate is used on many traditional crypto investments platforms, while APY refers to something altogether different.

**APY, Compound Interest and Market Opportunities**

**APY** describes a compounded interest rate over the course of the year. Compound interest is essentially interest compounded on top of the interest as it is generated. APY is short for Annual Percentage Yield, which describes that compounding effect. Essentially APY will be higher at the end of the year if the same percentage is attributed to APY and APR. For example, if APY is 10% and APR is 10% on 10,000 BUSD. At the end of the year the 10,000 BUSD would be 11,000 in the APR scenario, and 11,050.65 in the APY.

MIDAS Boost

There is another incentive, which comes in the form of an even higher annual percentage yield, called **Midas Boost**. It adds additional \~2-3% to the already highly competitive APYs offered to investors on the [Midas.Investments](https://Midas.Investments) crypto investments platform. The difference in the Midas Boost mechanism is that all generated yields are distributed in $MIDAS cryptocurrency tokens, the digital asset native to the platform. Midas Boost gives investors on the evolving hybrid CeDeFi platform, opportunities to gain in multiple ways, unlike traditional Centralized Finance platforms alone, and without the overly complex Decentralized Finance protocols and interfaces.

The market analysis shows that the rates offerded by Midas are currently the highest rates on staked fixed assets amongst all contemporary crypto investments platforms. Midas investors earn interest on Bitcoin and other major crypto coins such as Ethereum, BNB, Litecoin, AVAX, Fantom, and the top three stablecoins – USD Tether, USDC, and BUSD, to name a few of the 23 assets currently available.",11,2022-07-06 14:26:56,3

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,A Freshly Minted Stablecoin: $GBPT Overview,"[$GBPT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/poundtoken/) is a stablecoin backed by the Great British Pound Sterling (GBP) held in bank accounts. This means that GBPT, also known as “poundtoken,” can be converted 1:1 ratio with the pound sterling.

The pound token was launched by Blackfridge SC Ltd, a fintech company backed by British financial regulations. The initial introduction of the stablecoin was on the Ethereum blockchain, but the team aims to bridge to various blockchains. The stablecoin can be bought and traded on Gate.io, Uniswap, and Bittrex. Blackfridge’s road map includes plans on listening to a stablecoin on other prominent exchanges, as well.

The Terra UST stablecoin collapse shocked many investors, as they simply lost their funds, which obviously frightened the crypto space and questioned  “stable” stablecoins’ nature. Blackfridge wants to revive public confidence by guaranteeing a stablecoin backed by substantial reserves of the pound sterling. Some stablecoins are not backed 100% percent by fiat currency. That’s ensured by GBPT monthly attestations provided by such a reputable company[ as **KPMG**](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home.html)**.**   


### GBPT Tokenomics

* the current poundtoken price today is $1.21 USD
* with a 24-hour trading volume of $116,288 USD
* the current CoinMarketCap ranking is #4271
* self reported circulating supply 2,452,619.08 GBPT
* max supply 2,452,619
* total supply 2,452,619  


### $GBPT Main Features

Stablecoins are not new to the crypto industry but the $GBPT has a set of characteristics that offers truly tailored customer benefits, making the project draw attention. Here they are: 

* **KPMG Audited**

The Terra UST stablecoin crash matters, so Blackfridge made everything that is possible for user confidence and peace of mind by partnering with the Isle of Man's Financial Services Authority and having monthly audits with the auditing firm KPMG. 

KPMG's function is to verify that GBPT is 100 percent backed by the GBP by issuing proof-of-reserve statements monthly. Such transparency is not that common, and it's a testimony of the company's credibility. 

* **100 % Backed by GBP**

Unlike most stablecoins pegged to crypto or U.S. dollars, the GBPT is tied to the mighty pound sterling, which is a major world currency. GBP is one of the most traded currencies in the world. Every issued poundtoken is covered 100 percent by fiat GBP in bank reserves.

* **Solid Financial Regulation**

The Isle of Man's Financial Services Authority governs the GBPT and the Blackfridge. Its financial regulators are supported and licensed by the British financial regulatory regime. 

* **Safe**

All the transactions are encrypted, immutable, and secure, as a poundtoken is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses ERC20 smart contracts.   


### $GBPT and Other Stablecoins

**GBPT vs. USDT**

USDT, known as Tether, is the biggest project among stablecoins out there. The USDT pegged to the U.S. dollar has struggled against accusations that it has less fiat backing than it claims. Also, it lost its peg to the dollar, trading at less than a dollar for a while.

These issues question the regulation level over the most popular stablecoin. However, Tether calls itself to be entirely regulated, citing registration with FinCEN as proof, but most crypto industry experts can’t agree. The matter is that FinCEN is not actively involved in ensuring that a company providing financial services adheres to a set of rules.   


As for the GBPT, it has to operate based on the rules set by regulatory authorities. 

USDT and GBPT have similarities — they are both centralized. 

**GBPT vs. USDC**

USDC is considered to be second to the USDT. It was launched in 2018 by the Centre Consortium. The USDC is pegged to the U.S. dollar and has to obey audit and U.S. money transmission requirements. All this gained this coin a reputation as a more credible and secure stablecoin, although not as widely used as USDT.

**GBPT vs. TUSD**

TrueUSD (or TUSD) is a fully collateralized stablecoin backed by the U.S. dollar. The GBPT is in many ways similar to the TUSD on the regulatory side, as they’re both subjected to regular audits and compliant with state regulators. The GBPT is audited by KPMG, and the TUSD by the firm Armanino LLP.

The TUSD and the GPBT aren’t decentralized, and it’s under the control of TrueCoin LLC, the company behind the TrustToken Platform. The TUSD is also fully backed by its equivalent U.S. dollar, with every TUSD token having its equivalent dollar value stored in the bank to back it.  


### Closing Thoughts

First, Poundtoken, or GBPT, is created for stability and to return trust in the stablecoin market using accurate regulatory policies and regular audits. It wants to be a benchmark for stablecoins used in the global payment system smoothly.

Thus, it acts as a stable store of value and an exchange medium while maintaining transparency, safety, and swift transaction processing.

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,XR Reflect | New Token | Rewards | Strong Holders | PreSale on PinkSale,"XR-REFLECT is a new token on the Binance Smart Chain network, which allows each holder to receive a permanent passive income paid in $XRP. What could be more confident than receiving rewards immediately in XRP?

Our team really likes the idea of ​​projects that pay rewards to holders immediately XRP (THE FUTURE ELITE COIN). But in reality, there are very few such high-quality projects on the market. That is why we are here!

Why take additional risk, which is already high enough in cryptocurrency? We do not see the need for this and are more inclined towards only going up in value and there is no other coin with the potential of XRP. Regardless of the market, whether it goes up or down, you will always know that you will have XRP in your wallet.

Our goal is to distribute XR-Reflect to not only those that have been in the cryptocurrency community for a long time, but to also embrace a large number of ordinary people who are just starting to study the cryptocurrency world.

XR-REFLECT is not a meme coin, it is a rewards token rewarding you in XRP and our road map serves to create further use cases and volume to ensure the rewards never stop coming, no matter the price of XRP in the coming future.

Features / Tokenomics

10% Redistribution in XRP 10% of every buy/sell is taken and redistributed to all holders. Hold $XR-Reflect coins, earn XRP. A Minimum of 50 million tokens is required to receive rewards.

‍‍Rewards Paid out Automatically

‍For the first time ever, you don’t need to claim your earned XRP. It’s automatically sent to your wallet. Just add the Binance-Peg XRP token address to your wallet and you're set.

‍2% Marketing

2% of every transaction is allocated to Marketing in USDT. This allows us to fuel our most ambitious projects in service of further rewarding our community.

‍3% Liquidity Pool

‍3% of every transaction is converted into liquidity for PancakeSwap. It’s automatic and helps create a price floor (stability).

Tokenomics

There is a 15% buy tax. At times, our tokenomics may change in response to market conditions. The token contract employs a static rewards system. In summary the 15% buy tax is split as follows: 10% is redistributed to holders, 3% is used to fuel the Liquidity Pool, 2% is allocated to the Marketing wallet

‍Security - The XR-reflect team has taken several steps to ensure optimal security: The liquidity pool is locked for 12 months using the PinkSale platform. The XR-Reflect contract will be audited as per our roadmap and published. The Founder of XR-Reflect has provided the full KYC on the PinkSale.

# Introduction

*BabyTether is a new token in the Binance Smart Chain network, which allows each holder to receive permanent passive earnings, paid in $USDT.*

*What could be more stable and more confident than receiving rewards immediately in $?*

*Every week, tokens appear that pay rewards to holders in the form of other tokens (BNB, CAKE, ADA, AVAX, Dogecoin and so on). You depend at once on the price of two tokens: on the token that you are holding and on the other token in which you are credited with rewards. Of course, you can immediately sell the second token and convert it into dollars, but these are unnecessary actions, an unnecessary waste of attention and inconvenience. Especially if you are relaxing somewhere on the islands, drinking Pina Colada. Or you can hold the token that you receive as a reward, but this is an additional risk. The risk of the market falling, respectively, of this token.*

*Our team really likes the idea of ​​projects that pay rewards to holders immediately in the form of stablecoins (USDT, BUSD). But in reality, there are very few such high-quality projects on the market. That is why we are here!*

*Think about it. Why do you need extra actions? Why do you need additional risk, which is already enough in cryptocurrency? We do not see the need for this and are more inclined towards stability, to constancy. And there is nothing more stable in cryptocurrency than stablecoins. Regardless of the market, whether it goes up or down, you will always know that you have dollars in your portfolio that you can always use in real life. Better yet, when the market falling, you will have the funds to buy back the altcoins (which other projects offer you as rewards, haha) at even lower prices.*

*BabyTeather is not just a meme token, without functionality. Our team wants to make a great story out of this project. Something like BabyDogeCoin.. A wonderful project and wonderful admins. And we intend to repeat their success, but in a much more stable and acceptable form for ordinary people.*

*If you give a choice to an ordinary person who is not very familiar with cryptocurrency to buy a coin and receive rewards for it in CAKE/BNB/Dogecoin.. or in $, what will he choose? The answer is obvious. And our mission is to distribute BabyTether not in a narrowly focused way only in the cryptocurrency community, but by embracing a large number of ordinary people who are just starting to study the cryptocurrency world.*

# Features

**7% Redistribution in USDT**  
7% of every buy/sell is taken and redistributed to all holders. Hold $BabyTether tokens, earn USDT. A Minimum of 200,000 tokens is required in order to receive rewards.

**Rewards Paid Automatically**  
For the first time ever, you don’t need to claim your earned USDT. It’s automatically sent to your wallet. Just add the Tether USD token ($USDT) address to your wallet and you're set.

**Dashboard**  
[https://dashboard.babytether.app/](https://dashboard.babytether.app/)  
Our convenient dashboard optimized for any device will help you easily track and claim your rewards and monitor the current state of the BabyTether token.

**3% Liquidity Pool**  
3% of every transaction is converted into liquidity for PancakeSwap. It’s automatic and helps create a price floor (stability).

**1% Sell Fee**  
An extra 1% fee is applied to all sells. This will allow us to reduce swing-trading and break whales’ control.

**Secured By Design**  
Initial Liquidity Provided is locked with PinkSale. Fully Audited by CERTIK & InterFi.

**Massive Marketing Plan**  
5% of every transaction is allocated to Marketing in USDT. This allows us to fuel our most ambitious projects in service of further rewarding our community. Marketing wallet: [https://bscscan.com/address/0x9327fb6c88fa9e6abe7c9cf2f327fe5e48c5fd4c](https://bscscan.com/address/0x9327fb6c88fa9e6abe7c9cf2f327fe5e48c5fd4c)

**Calculator (coming soon)**  
[https://calculator.babytether.app/](https://calculator.babytether.app/)  
Soon after the launch, a calculator will be added, with which you can calculate your earnings in USDT, based on the number of BabyTether tokens in your wallet and the current trading volume.

**BabyTether Swap (coming soon)**  
[https://swap.babytether.app/](https://swap.babytether.app/)  
Soon after the launch, we will also add a built-in Swap to our website, so that anyone can buy BabyTether tokens even easier, without switching to other exchange platforms.

**Buy via Card (coming soon)**  
[https://buy.babytether.app/](https://buy.babytether.app/)  
It will become even easier for ordinary people to buy the BabyTether token! It is enough to make a payment directly with your bank card, after which you will receive BNB to the specified wallet, which you can exchange for BabyTether tokens in the Swap tab. 

# Dividend Distribution Mechanism

The dividend mechanism incentivizes token holders to hold in order to earn dividends from the transactions (buys and sells).

    The dividends are not dependent on the price of BabyTether. They are based purely on the volume and proportional to the BabyTether amount you hold in your wallet.

* All $USDT the contract gains are split proportionally between the token holders
* To receive dividends a minimum token balance of 200,000 BabyTether is required to be held in a wallet
* The contract keeps track of all the dividends due to each holder in a list
* Every transaction processes a certain number of users from the list
* The number of holders processed through each transaction is dynamic and based on transaction size
* Holders will receive dividends from the queue based on their position in the list
* It’s a fair system, fully automated

# Security

**The BabyTether team has taken several steps to ensure optimal security:**

1. The liquidity pool is locked for 12 months using the PinkSale platform
2. BabyTether contract address has been audited by one of the most popular and trustworthy companies CERTIK: [https://www.certik.com/projects/babytether](https://www.certik.com/projects/babytether)
3. The Founder of BabyTether provided the full KYC on the PinkSale, with documents and video confirmation (on the pre-sale page you can see confirmation of this)
4. 5% of the team tokens are locked for 12 months with linear unlocking (more information on the pre-sale page)

  NFT Card Collective tokaen with 12 % USDT reward distributed to every holders. **Swap your USDT to**  
  **USD and withdraw to your Bank Card in 2min**. Audited with Tech Audit and Verified contract with  
  Pinksale Finance\*\*.\*\* Our goal is to give something brand new which would boost the holders’ asset  
  value. We have kept the supply very low – at 900,000 tokens – which will be very beneficial for the  
  holders.

  Compared to the several hundred other tokens, this is a fraction of the supply which the other  
  projects have determined at the start and will allow us to exponentially boost the value of our token.  
  Along with a fairly low supply, our most attractive feature is the rewards scheme for the users  
  composed of giving away a 12% USDT premium to every CRH holder.

  This is a two-in-one impressive combination giving customers an opportunity to benefit both from a  
  capital gain and a passive income. To make our mark in the crypto world, we are also planning to  
  launch an NFT shop with a huge Asian marketing campaign on the largest NFT marketplace Opensea.

0.1 Eth purchase of Elonone per entry. Example: 0.1 Eth = 1 entry and 1 Eth = 10 entries. Entries made *AFTER* the time of this post are included.

\*Draw will be made on Saturday 16th April live on VC.

\*\*You must also NOT sell any Elonone before the draw to qualify.

\*\*\*You can enter as many times as you like. Good luck!

**ABOUT THE TOKEN:**

**$ELONONE** is a utility token that powers a revolutionary new gasless NFT marketplace and a play to earn crypto racing game.

* Gasless NFT Marketplace called AstroZero.
* Play 2 Earn crypto racing game called Rocket Dash
* Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply!
* Liquidity locked for 100 years.
* 13700 holders and rising.
* Low market cap.

**Gasless NFT Marketplace**

Elonone will be the token that powers the revolutionary upcoming gasless NFT marketplace called AstroZero. This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.

AstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.

We strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.

There is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.

Not only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.

We aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.

**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**

* Zero gas fees.
* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%
* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.
* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.
* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.
* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.
* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.

**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**

Elonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.

In Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.

Rockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.

If you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.

Crypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.

**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**

* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!
* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.
* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.

**Liquidity locked for 100 years**

The Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.

He did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.

**13700 holders and rising**

Elonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.

With the project we are building it is easy to see why.

**Low market cap**

At the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.

We are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.

Now is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.

**Tokenomics**

2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.

It pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.

**Info**

* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year
* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit
* Liquidity locked for 100 years

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,$Elonone 👩‍🚀 - Gasless NFT Marketplace 🌟 - Play 2 Earn Crypto Game 🎮 -Vitalik Buterin Burned 38% 🔥 - $1000 USDT Giveaway 💰," **🚨$1000 USDT GIVEWAY🚨**

0.1 Eth purchase of Elonone per entry. Example: 0.1 Eth = 1 entry and 1 Eth = 10 entries. Entries made *AFTER* the time of this post are included.

\*Draw will be made on Saturday 16th April live on VC.

\*\*You must also NOT sell any Elonone before the draw to qualify.

\*\*\*You can enter as many times as you like. Good luck!

**ABOUT THE TOKEN:**

**$ELONONE** is a utility token that powers a revolutionary new gasless NFT marketplace and a play to earn crypto racing game.

* Gasless NFT Marketplace called AstroZero.
* Play 2 Earn crypto racing game called Rocket Dash
* Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply!
* Liquidity locked for 100 years.
* 13700 holders and rising.
* Low market cap.

**Gasless NFT Marketplace**

Elonone will be the token that powers the revolutionary upcoming gasless NFT marketplace called AstroZero. This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.

AstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.

We strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.

There is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.

Not only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.

We aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.

**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**

* Zero gas fees.
* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%
* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.
* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.
* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.
* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.
* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.

**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**

Elonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.

In Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.

Rockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.

If you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.

Crypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.

**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**

* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!
* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.
* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.

**Liquidity locked for 100 years**

The Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.

He did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.

**13700 holders and rising**

Elonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.

With the project we are building it is easy to see why.

**Low market cap**

At the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.

We are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.

Now is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.

**Tokenomics**

2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.

It pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.

**Info**

* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year
* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit
* Liquidity locked for 100 years
* Listed on CG + CMC
* Strong community rising daily
* Whitepaper released and available on the website

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Which exchange(s) have 0% trading fees (at least for BTC/USDT) and a decent API?,"I was using Binance.US but they're in trouble at the moment.

I absolutely need the first 4 but all 5 would be great.

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,$Elonone 👩‍🚀 - Gasless NFT Marketplace 🌟 - Play 2 Earn Crypto Game 🎮 -Vitalik Buterin Burned 38% 🔥 - $1000 USDT Giveaway 💰," **🚨$1000 USDT GIVEWAY🚨**

0.1 Eth purchase of Elonone per entry. Example: 0.1 Eth = 1 entry and 1 Eth = 10 entries. Entries made *AFTER* the time of this post are included.

\*Draw will be made on Saturday 16th April live on VC.

\*\*You must also NOT sell any Elonone before the draw to qualify.

\*\*\*You can enter as many times as you like. Good luck!

**ABOUT THE TOKEN:**

**$ELONONE** is a utility token that powers a revolutionary new gasless NFT marketplace and a play to earn crypto racing game.

* Gasless NFT Marketplace called AstroZero.
* Play 2 Earn crypto racing game called Rocket Dash
* Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply!
* Liquidity locked for 100 years.
* 13700 holders and rising.
* Low market cap.

**Gasless NFT Marketplace**

Elonone will be the token that powers the revolutionary upcoming gasless NFT marketplace called AstroZero. This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.

AstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.

We strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.

There is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.

Not only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.

We aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.

**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**

* Zero gas fees.
* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%
* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.
* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.
* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.
* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.
* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.

**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**

Elonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.

In Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.

Rockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.

If you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.

Crypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.

**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**

* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!
* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.
* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.

**Liquidity locked for 100 years**

The Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.

He did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.

**13700 holders and rising**

Elonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.

With the project we are building it is easy to see why.

**Low market cap**

At the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.

We are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.

Now is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.

**Tokenomics**

2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.

It pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.

**Info**

* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year
* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit

**🔥 Exchange platform**

Hashbon Rocket is a first-ever CDEX enabling the exchange of **any ERC-20 tokens to any BEP-20 tokens** and vice versa. MVP is ready, and they've started filling liquidity pools already.

[https://rocket.hashbon.com/](http://rocket.hashbon.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=cryptocurrencytrading&utm_campaign=0110)

**✅** Important project update: The first liquidity pool is ready. USDT → BUSD. Now you can swap USDT (ERC-20) to BUSD (BEP-20) on Hashbon Rocket. Check it out! 

If you would like to become a liquidity provider and create a pool, u can contact [As@hashbon.com](mailto:As@hashbon.com)

**✅** Certik audit in progress[ https://www.certik.org/projects/hashbon](https://www.certik.org/projects/hashbon)

**🧩 Why is Hashbon Rocket unique?**

* Anyone can become a liquidity provider
* A decentralized network of arbiters ensure full transparency and fairness of the exchange
* No exchange limits. You can exchange any amount of tokens.

According to the WP: Currently, the product brings together two blockchains: Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Further steps include adding new chains: EVM-compatible blockchains (Ethereum Classic, Matic, Fantom, Huobi Eco, xDai).

**🟡 HASH Token**

HASH token is now on presale. It's better not to miss the opportunity!

10 000 000 HASH tokens for sale at this step.

24 000 HASH tokens for 1 ETH

3 300 HASH tokens for 1 BNB

**Grab your HASH at a good price before Presale ends!** 

For more information check out the Presale page[ ](http://rocket.hashbon.com/sale?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=cryptocurrencyico&utm_campaign=0110)[https://rocket.hashbon.com/sale](http://rocket.hashbon.com/sale?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=cryptocurrencytrading&utm_campaign=0110)

📌 Also you can buy HASH token here:

[Pancakeswap](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xeb1112ac78d537853150e2a07e8b765e29d3f019) (BEP-20)

The HASH Token price on DEXs can be different from presale price.  It's better to compare prices before buying to get a better deal, I think.

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,For those of you looking for safe haven in USDC/USDT while still earning 15% APY - this pertains to you.,"Hi everyone! Hope you're all laying low and staying safe under current market conditions. I just wanted to introduce a dark horse in the CeFi world to you if you feel like earning passive income on your stablecoins.

You can check out [Finblox](https://finblox.com), which is offering 15% on USDC, USDT, DAI, and BUSD. Maybe the APY is not as high as some riskier platforms, but you do get A) custody and insurance from Fireblocks for up to 45M, B) no required lock-in periods, and C) no tiering or diminishing rates based on deposit size or other conditions. There are other benefits, but DYOR.

Also, they're backed by some pretty huge VCs like Sequoia, Three Arrows Capital, Dragonfly Capital, Coinfund, and more. I think we can all agree that safety takes precedence over high yields atm.

Below are some charts to show you very transparently what your rates would look like compared with other major platforms if you did not meeting certain hidden conditions/tiering levels.

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Here's how Do Kwon cashed out $2.7 billion using Degenbox to drain liquidity out of the LUNA & UST system and into hard money like USDT,"Credit: [https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1535623662153437185](https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1535623662153437185)

Do Kwon was a paper billionaire with no way to cash out without causing a depeg. Heres how he used degenbox to cash out into usdt/usdc

Lets start with what degenbox is: a borrowing protocol where people can loop stablecoin buys. You can stake collateral to buy UST, put it into Anchor, then use your aUST to borrow more UST, put it into Anchor again... You get the drill. It's Anchor on steroids. 

 Terra influencers shilled this strategy en masse, and thousands of retail users began flooding into Degenbox to access the high yields.  This created incredibly thick, near-immovable liquidity near the top of the peg zone (the $0.98 to $1.00 range). In a nutshell, it would allow for someone to cash out billions of UST for MIM at a 1:1 rate without disturbing the peg - all thanks to inorganic demand. 

Here's the total amount of MIM Do Kwon was able to cash out through the MIM/UST pool - without even moving the peg! $2,719,132,772.01, to do with what he pleases. No need to dump LUNA or sell UST on exchanges - he drummed up liquidity from all of you. 

https://preview.redd.it/17acssrn40591.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=79356b83aef142fd546bcf33972658175e3050f1

UST is the future, he said. Decentralized money is sound money, he said. UST won't depeg, he told you. 'Centralized stablecoins will rug you eventually.' So why did he cash out $2.7b from UST into USDT and USDC? Were all those words just lies? (Spoiler: yes.) 

https://preview.redd.it/lnqogfqt40591.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=e93885ed51bdb66e654f912358d6ff5b98688263

Here are TFL's outflows. $558m to KuCoin, $1.08b to Binance, $545m to Huobi - you get the gist. Ultimately, all of this money is liquidity being removed from the Terra ecosystem, exacerbating the collapse, bolstering TFL coffers - all while they lied to your face.

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Seascape.network the STEAM of DeFi...20x potential. Ticker: CWS/USDT on MXC.com,"From Diamondhedge Sub: DD from Infamous-Sympathy- 91

Many of you have been waiting ages for my next investment call, and I've worked very hard to make sure I do not disappoint! Feel free to share my DD in any other subreddit or social media platform to raise awareness.

KEY DETAILS: CWS/USDT ([https://www.seascape.network/](https://www.seascape.network/))

**24h Trading Volume on MXC:** only 87,603 USDT

**24h Trading Range:** $25-$28.267

**Market Cap:** $26m (Audius was $27m when I first called them, it hit an ATH of $580m)

**Investors:** Binance, LD Capital, Paka, Spark Digital Capital, Nabais Capital, M6, DU Capital, JRR Capital.

**Partners:** Chainlink, Moonbeam, Opensea, Maker, Binance Smart Chain, Matic, Treasureland etc...

I got in at $25 today for $25k so far invested. Seeking price target of $500 (20x on $26m mcap to $520m in less than 8 weeks). Likely they will be listed on Binance around $125m mcap or sooner. It's Alt Season now so they *may* increase quicker OR ath may be higher OR both. Remember Audius took nearly 4 weeks to double from my 22 cent call then it exploded to $4.99. Price increases are not linear.

Recall, I developed a deep learning assisted bot to search the internet and work out which of these 1000s of silly coins will gain. CWS/USDT also popped up as another prime candidate gaining the traction metrics leading to organic big gains over the next few months. Add in a coordinated HODL at this volume level and you have a 20x-er. Untouched it has reached $50 by itself, **uncorrelated**generally to BTC, so its a prime alt season huge upswing candidate. Technicals also show a quick fib retracement to $50 within the next 2 weeks or sooner with good buying activity. No one was keeping track of what I said with Audius, this time, it may be different?

**Special Considerations:** Becoming the STEAM game distribution platform for DeFi is a much more realistic proposition than becoming a massive AAA-game developer such as the Activision of DeFi, we are years away from seeing anything like that. I've overseen game production in my past and it's a tough business! Delays happen all the time, and its ends up being expensive and taking much longer than anticipated (even if you x2 or x3 your most conservative time length expectations). Mu**ch better to be the picker and chooser of great games.** I also have contacts at Supercell (who made the great Clash of Clans) and I will hook these guys up. I spent the last few days talking to the founder of Seascape and drilled him for information and believe they are on the right track.

Like Audius, this is a coin with a website that the GENERAL PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND with a product that can be used now, granted they only have a few games, they are developing their blockchain to make it very cost effective and scalable for much bigger game titles to use them as their **in-game coin economy** partner, even if they have better distribution than seascape now. Seascape is an **in-game economy technology partner first and foremost. They are doing the hard stuff, unlike Ultra, so that they later this year become the distribution partner of choice for DeFi game titles.** Ultra is just steam with tokens and they are already around $250m market cap right now, so you see, Seascape could blow them out of the water!

**SEE BELOW FOR COMPETITOR ANALYSIS for when Seascape was JUST $528k mcap** at a $10m private investor valuation (when they first listed - they caught up to that private investor valuation within weeks and that was picked up by my crypto bot - very sorry for the few weeks lag, my bot still needs to crunch data, still working out how to find gems right when they first list but that's an extremely hard thing to do!!)

However, as with Audius, I hope another 20x is good enough, BUT I picked this up much sooner than Audius after listing so 30x is my hopium target although I don't want to be too bold. I am seeking $750 take profit if this one keeps rising strongly after surpassing $500.

📷

Long-term hodler for sure...

**Remember**: this is a Reddit post, it is NOT financial advice, dispense your loads where ever you wish after doing your own DD and research and maybe throwing a dart at a wall. YOLO. I'm packing up to Mars. Audius already got us to the Moon! (x20 on x20 is x400).

**Notes:**

pCWS is the bridged version of CWS (the currency of Seascape on ETH) on BSC (Binance Smart Chain). Users can bridge from ETH to BSC using poly.network bridge. 1 CWS = 1 pCWS as they are completely interchangeable. Here's a walk-through of Polybridge: [https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1](https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1)

**High number of coins in a few wallets:** Audius had a similar position where 84% of coins were held in 2 wallets. Seascape's token release schedule is structured to cause growth in their ecosystem and corresponding growth in their price to mitigate future inflation effects. Essentially new games will be backed by newly released CWS acting as collateral for newly minted game coin economies generated on the Seascape blockchain. This means, as a new game grows its user base and its in game economy grows in value, those additionally released CWS should in effect pay for themselves mitigating inflation effects. Interestingly, Audius had a similar reason for releasing new coins, i.e. to attract new artists, and it grew from $27m mcap to an ath of $580m.

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,5 Reasons to participate in $AquaTank Fairlaunch - SC 99 BNB -RFI 2% USDT - Double audit- Bitmart listing Confirmed,"Aqua Tank is Strategy NFTs lifetime reward staking protocol, co-developed on the foundation of NFT-in-metaverse technology.

The concept of AquaTank was inspired by the countless unexplored Islands that exist throughout several continents. These Islands are inaccessible to people and are solely inhabited by marine wildlife, a location for many bioregions. The AquaTank project is now, at last exploring and using these abandoned Islands for the betterment of localities around it.

On this protocol, players are rewarded for finding and holding onto various marine NFTs.

All NFTs utilities fall within the Hold-to-Earn concept of this protocol, thus resulting in the development of a highly monetized model for passive income generation through carefully choosing which NFTs to acquire!

The fair launch of AquaTank is scheduled to be on August 13th, 2022. Those who will be participating in the fair launch will have the chance to get following perks

**Fairlaunch participants will get free Island NFTs which cost 100,000 $AQUA tokens at the end of fairlaunch.**

The Island NFTs in AquaTank are the prime key to mint different marine pet NFT in the game. Hence, a gift Island NFT can be used to mint a PET.

**Life-time reward generation with $AQUA tokens**

The AquaTank life-time reward generation yields continuous rewards throughout the duration of token holding by the user. Through life-time reward generation now our players can hold any of the PET NFTs to earn a definite sum for unlimited time.

The life-time reward generation works through minting any one of the three pets on the protocol. These are utility NFTs, that generate a constant sum after every 24 hours, and can easily be claimed through the dashboard on [aquatank.io](https://aquatank.io)

**Low transaction fee with BSC**

Our goal is to make DeFi available to the average household. Because of Ethereum’s high gas fees, most people are unable to access the Ethereum network. We chose the Binance Smart Chain because we want AquaTank to be accessible to everyone, including small holders. This, however, does not preclude us from utilising DeFi yield protocols on Ethereum

Another perk of holding $AQUA, is the low fee associated with the protocol due to its underlying blockchain, *Binance smart chain.* The blockchain charges $0.15 per transaction. And it is able to execute 300 transactions per second. With the aforestated high scalability of the network, the transaction fee is only negligible. Among other reasons to choose AquaTank, is the high scalability of the underlying network.

**The live dashboard on the Aquatank.io**

Another interesting feature of the AquaTank protocol is the ease and accessibility of information. In the preceding section I explained about life-ime return and how easy it was to claim them on a daily basis. Claiming your reward is one thing, but logging into apps could be a hassle. To ease its users, AquaTank has a live dashboard on its website that shows your personalised holdings, rewards ready to be claimed and the rate of return daily percentage.

**Double Audit by Safuu audit and SolidProof**

The AquaTank protocol put high emphasis on the security of it’s user’s funds. To keep up with its standards of high security, the smart contract of the protocol is audited by two different independent protocols, Safuu audit and SolidProof audit. Both of which use rigorous methods to test the credibility of the protocol. The audit reports are available on the AquaTank.io

**Confirmed CEX listing**

Lastly, for our users, AquaTank is listed on one of the following CEX

1. Hotbit
2. Bitmart
3. XT.com
4. CoinTiger

Based on twitter poll we will take final decision and contact respective exchange for listing $Aqua Token so then you can visit their platform and exchange to buy and sell $AQUA.

To keep our launch transparent and un-influenced by any external intervention, we have opt for fair launch instead of pre-sale.

Security and transparency are two of our company’s core values. As a result, a thorough examination of our current technology and everything to come was inherent. The audit has only just begun, but we can confirm that both of these aforementioned reputable firms will provide a full audit for our decentralised smart contract.

**Breakthrough of the smart contract audit**

**AquaTank**

AquaTank is a life-time reward based NFTs protocol on binance smart chain, featured on both the console and the Metaverse. The AquaTank game has 3D holographic avatars in the AquaTank metaverse. The game is equipped with a PVE and PVP version, both of which enable Play-to-earn.

Smart Contract: [here](https://bscscan.com/token/0x866EAF963273B7D934da432b6fa893E383CaF499)Detailed Audit Report: [here](https://app.solidproof.io/projects/aqua-tank)

**Layer-by-Layer smart contract audit**

A smart contract audit is a thorough systematised examination and analysis of the code of a smart contract that interacts with a cryptocurrency or blockchain. This process is used to identify errors, issues, and unpatched vulnerabilities in the code in order to recommend improvements and solutions. Smart contract audit of the AquaTank securities is required because our contracts deal with financial assets and/or valuable items.Therefore, we have requested two well-reputed firms to thoroughly audit our smart contracts. Both firms applied a rigorous testing method, which is briefly mentioned in the next section.

The AquaTank smart contract is thoroughly investigated using Static Analysis and Manual Review techniques. The following factors were scrutinised during the auditing process:

* Smart contracts are tested against both common and uncommon attack vectors.
* Examining the codebase to ensure that it adheres to current best practises and industry standards.
* Ensure that the contract logic meets the client’s specifications and intentions.
* Contract structure and implementation are compared to similar smart contracts produced by industry leaders.
* Manually reviewing the entire codebase line by line

Auditor couldn’t find any critical or high risk threats though we have some medium level warnings our team would like to explain and encounter in the following section.

We have medium level warnings which says owner can maximize fee upto 100% which is just because of not putting cap value. I would like to explain that we are using standard contract format it has and this smart contract is forked from one of renowned project. Idea is to renounce ownership once liquidity is locked so there is no need to get insecure or worried about this functionality. We are more focused on life-time reward utility.

&#x200B;

**About Solid proof**

Solidproof generates auditable, detailed reports that identify any issues or vulnerabilities in a protocol’s code. They then categorise and list these errors based on their severity level: critical, medium, and low.

Furthermore, Solidproof incorporates KYC (Know Your Customer) standards. They are used by the company to verify the users’ identities and determine whether they pose a risk of money laundering. Furthermore, it aids protocols in determining whether potential investors obtain their funds from legitimate sources.

Finally, Solidproof addresses privacy concerns by storing client data on secure servers. This ensures maximum security for potentially sensitive data. As a result, new projects can rely on its risk-free approach to data storage optimization.

The project offers dynamic rewards that get paid out based on multiple factors, but rewards also can be claimed manually so there is no need to wait. The great thing about TetherMoon is that it is not your average reward token. In the forest of reward tokens and tokens in general it is hard to pick out the real gems that really offer potential and have an amazing vision, plan, team and support behind it! Okay, so what makes TetherMoon different then all the other reward tokens that exist? There are so many reasons that can be mentioned because everything about this project is basically amazing. An amazing development team that has KYCed, already partnered with Passive Income (PSI) which has an excellent track record and is KYCed itself also and is a registered company, an amazing community behind it that is constructive and very supportive! Well guys, these are some of the reasons. The really special reasons are listed below. Do not miss out on this next 100x moon shot, because this project can put a big stamp on the crypto space!

💥 New architectural network structure of validators (frictionless elastic validation), which safeguards an inclusive approach on sharing in rewards on the block-chain!

USDT,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Are you worried about current audit with USDT? Check this once!,"USDT recently hit the news as it underwent a major ""audit"", partly to stay in compliance with a recent settlement agreement made between Tether and the New York Attorney General's Office. But the veracity of this audit has been called into question by many crypto enthusiasts. Seen as an attempt to answer critics on what actually backs USDT, the audit still left many unanswered questions.

This seems big talks but it really affects small traders like us. So, what's the solution. Check [EURST](https://eurst.io/), a live audited asset-backed stablecoin.

Polkalokr is the first all-in-one, multi-chain token locking and escrow platform with built-in privacy functionality. Their products, LOKR and SWAPR, help build trust within the Defi space by removing the human element and focusing on governance through code with a seamless, omnichannel digital experience platform. Polkalokr will introduce the ability to swap locked tokens, which is not yet available in the space.

They have taken tokenomics to a new level. The oracle integration allows projects to start vesting tokens based on events, for example, when the token price or product milestones are reached, instead of a time-based cliff.  They will also provide projects with revenue streams through their locked tokens.  Polkalokr is multi-chain and not reliant on just ERC20 or DOT. They are looking to create new markets by introducing swap-locked tokens and direct vesting to new buyers.

There is a lack of trust in the digital asset space due to rug pulls and exit scams. Polkalokr’s products will help protect the community from bad actors and bring a layer of transparency to project tokenomics. Their Native token LOKR is used for payments on the Polkalokr Platform. LOKR is also utilized for governance, rewards, and staking.

&#x200B;

It has a couple of visualizations for Tether stability metrics (1.price on Kraken, and 2.Bitfinex premium) and if a certain threshold on each is passed, depending on the level of urgency, it will either change colour or the browser icon will start flashing.

On tether's site it doesn't list binance chain as supported. Nor does it list any usdt on tether.  However I see usdt on binance chain.

What am I missing?

updates, thanks for giving me some info on things to look into here is what my understanding at this time which may or may not be correct is:

USDT on binance isn't really USDT.  The name of the coin implies it is pegged, not wrapped: Binance-Peg BSC-USD (BSC-USD).  This is very confusing as many exchanges list it as USDT..

https://www.bscscan.com/token/0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955?a=0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955 at the time of writing this it shows total supply of 4,979,997,922.

I have contacted support to ask where they keep the reserve or if that information is public.  I am assuming it is.  As far as I can tell binance offers this bridge product https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/introducing-binance-bridge-20-421499824684903626

USDT,Binance,In light of all the Tether news is there an tentative plans to move away from them as the standard?,"Its obvious that this coin has questionable legitamacy and I feel like as long as exchanges continue to support it we are holding the entire market back from true organic growth. If this news broke and we actually had proper fiat gateways or etfs we would be in a much worse position.

I feel like this is a situation that we need to handle now sooner rather than later. While short term it would not be ideal we need to look at the long term health and sustainability of the market. 

Take the bandaid off now so to speak rather than allow it to continue to be built like a house of cards.

Further I do not see the entire market going full fiat due to such a radical change - if you asked me that a few years ago I would have agreed but times have changed. Heck half the reason people use stablecoins is to remain *in* the crypto market to begin with and not deal within their own currency or local jurisdictions exchanges.

Now that there are far more legitamate stablecoins out there I can see the liqudiity moving to the other stable coin alternatives. Yes there would be some retrace but it will recover and we can then move forward. Allowing this to continue on is only delaying the problem and making it far worse fir everyone in the long run. 

If Binance truly wants whats best for the market and understands the importance of its long term health I dont understand how they can continue to allow usdt trading given everything that has recently been revealed. At this point you are enabling bad actors in the space and the only way to stop this from continuing to happen would be a coordinated plan to step away from the usdt standard.",28,2019-04-30 02:47:41,13

USDT,Binance,How does Tether maintain its peg to the US dollar?,"Hi guys, 

Just wondering, how exactly does tether (the cryptocurrency which maintains a 1 to 1 peg with the US dollar) work exactly in terms of its peg?

Specially, how is this peg maintained??

I struggle to understand how this peg can be maintained exactly if fiat currencies cannot even do this.

Take for example Lebanon. For those unfamiliar the Lebanese Lira used to have a peg of 1500 Lebanese lira to 1 US dollar.

This peg was maintained for decades until it could no longer be maintained anymore, the peg was let go and hyperinflation was created as a result until present day.

There are many other countries with similar experiences.

My question is, why would Tether be any different? 

Or is it not and there will be a time in which the 1 to 1 peg between tether and the US dollar will be let go as well and all those holding Tether will have their money rendered valueless after the fact?

Thanks in advance.",3,2021-07-31 21:44:25,2
USDT,Binance,"Tether, Bitfinex and Evergrande….","I need some crypto mechanics, guys and gals who are so involved in crypto and investing that they can give some good advice on the subject of this post.

First, almost 75% of all BTC transactions nowadays are initially purchased using Tether (USDT), the 4th largest crypto by market cap sitting at roughly $70 billion dollars as of this posting.

Originally, Tether was said to be backed 1:1 with US Dollars, in other words, every Tether coin minted was backed by a  US dollar being held in reserve. 

That is not the case anymore, we have learned that Tether is only backed by 10% cash reserves the rest is backed by US Dollar “equivalents!” Almost 50% of that backing, roughly $35 billion is backed by commercial paper, and that commercial paper is almost surely Chinese commercial paper, because the Tether creators “will not” disclose whose paper they hold! 

Mind you, Tether is connected to Bitfinex crypto exchange. The people that created Bitfinex are the same people that created Tether, they actually used a loan from one company to the other to help a serious financial issue Bitfinex was having.

Now, Bitfinex is pretty shady, and their ownership are the people that own Tether, let that sink in….

Now, on to a second issue. We have Evergrande, China’s second largest real estate company teetering on the edge of collapse and the gov’t has said that they WILL NOT bail them out. This compounded on top of an already shaky bond market in China…

If Evergrande goes under it will have repercussions in the entire Chinese money system, and all markets will be affected! Stocks, bonds, debt and crypto!

So, let’s recap, Tether is 50% backed by (assumption) Chinese commercial paper, and owned and operated by shady Bitfinex characters that have already broke their trust by only having 10% US dollar reserves for every Tether in circulation. This same Tether is connected to almost 75% of all Bitcoin transactions over the world…

The Chinese bond market and their 2nd largest real estate company is on very shaky ground….

Here is my question to the mystical crypto Gods…..

What can we do to hedge against a fallout in the event that Tether were to fail and hurt not only the entire crypto market but other markets as well. 

What investments in crypto do you think would be shielded from , or have less risk if this event if it were to occur? 

I know people do not have a crystal ball, but I have been wrapping my head around this for about 5 days now and I have run out of mental power to see a clear path through this potential risk. The whole thing is so complex with many moving parts I was hoping that any ideas might help us all brainstorm some inventive solutions for our own protection!

USDT,Binance,Stable Coin: Economics Perspective," 

We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.

 

# 1) Not An Illusion

Stable coin is not an illusion. Stable coin is a type of monetary policy a project chooses. For instance, to **peg** the cryptocurrency to something (e.g. USD).

When we talk about cryptocurrencies, we have to talk about the different types of monetary policy. One of them is fixing exchange rates. Other options are inflation targeting, price level targeting, mixed policies, etc.

## Case in point:

(compare it to the fiat-world) You have countries like Panama, Ecuador, El Salvador using a 1:1 exchange rate with USD. For other countries, they peg their currency to USD like Belize, Barbados, Hong Kong, UAE. ([Source](https://www.oanda.com/currency/iso-currency-codes/USD))

# 2) Types of Monetary Policy

When we talk about international monetary policy, we have to mention the **impossible trilemma**. Basically, central banks/currencies have to choose 2 out of 3 options to create their currency. They are

* fixed exchange rate
* free capital flow
* sovereign monetary policy

Many of the stable coins (e.g. USDC, Tether) collect 1 USD to create 1 USD equivalent of their token, hence the “stable-ness” relative to USD. This means they give up control of their own monetary policy.

This seems fine right now, but as the economy grows, monetary policy becomes very important because we are talking about inflation rates and interest rates (if any). If the stable coin is only controlled by the US-FED (external control), it is a risk for the internal environment to operate.

## Case in point:

Greece crisis in 2012. Greece, being part of EU, had to give up their monetary policy control, and follow the ECB. Greece needed an expansionary monetary policy. But since it uses Euros and linked to the other Euro-nations like Germany, the expansionary policy suitable for Greece is NOT suitable for Germany at that time. Hence, Greece wanted to get out to resolve their economy.

Cryptoeconomics is all about the long-term sustainability of the project with minimal speculation.

If this were to happen in the stable coin universe in the foreseeable future as the internal economy grows, the dependent monetary policy will pose as a risk to the stable coin’s economy.

# 3) Stable doesn't mean it does not change.

Stable means it is **stable relative to something**. E.g. gold, USD, GBP.

The point of stable coin is to reduce velocity of the currency, hence reduce the risk associated with it. A new technology (DLT, blockchain) is risky enough if we can mitigate the risk with stable coins, that is a huge bonus.

In our instant-gratification society, we want to see results now and fast. The fastest way to reduce velocity is to create a pegged 1:1 coin - my point #2.

There are other ways to create a more stable type of currency that works in the long-term. The downside: it takes time to perfect the monetary policy (mechanism design) & other tokenomics pillars.

# 4) “Stable coins don’t exist because fiat currencies are not stable.”

O*kay... ... but what do you mean by “stable”?*

But there are other ways to create a stable currency using other monetary policy and nominal anchors.

\*Quick crash course: nominal anchors in the fiat-world is what the government provides to increase stability to the economy at the expense of the government’s autonomy. They are the single variable to pun down the expectations of private agents (e.g. USD holders, token holders) about nominal price levels (not price levels less inflation).

## Case in point:

USD does not have an exchange rate target. We learnt that from the failed Bretton Wood System. USD is also the global currency, so it doesn’t make sense for them to fix their exchange rate to something else. Instead, they use other methods, e.g. inflation rate targeting. US Fed does that. (Source) Bank of England does that too.

# Conclusion

* Stable coins are useful. It is real. It is not an illusion.
* The idea of using a 1:1 peg is good in the short-term. For long-term success, I have my worries.
* There are other ways to manage the monetary policy apart from exchange rate targeting.",1,2021-12-19 04:30:54,21

USDT,Binance,Binance is lucky Syscoin is inviting BUSD to their upcoming #NEVM - SYS and its Bitcoin secured EVM and Ethereum compatible offerings its bringing to these L1/L2 is the most overlooked underrated improvement in the last 5 years of cryptocurrency security and value,"Time to open up the floodgates Binance. Syscoin and TetherUS (Property 31 on Omni Layer - issued by Bitcoin network itself from P2SH) - its time to stop the madness and reward the hodlers. :)

I don't use CEX but I do love your BSC and some offerings on your [pancakeswap.finance](https://pancakeswap.finance) like $MOOND from my man u/Mellon98 :P Buying Reddit $MOON with BUSD BEP-20 Token on MoonsSwap is quite convenient too. Bravo.

Now it's time for $SYSCOIN and its CTO's 0.9.2devcoin Counterparty branch for smart contracts on cheaper merge mined with BTC Chain for over 10 years to bring Bitcoin security to your EVM and Ethereum-based networks!!! [https://github.com/devcoin/core/commit/cf3e03bad10368d96294769b740841919b636810](https://github.com/devcoin/core/commit/cf3e03bad10368d96294769b740841919b636810)

Give Jag Sidhu his credit, he's going to shine when u see what he's done (devcoin-android)/counterparty and smartcontracts for later date for cheap and periodically update with the BTC main chain to updated periodically with difficulty/security among SHA-256G Merge Mined chains alongside Syscoin 4.2.2, Namecoin Core 0.22.0, Ixcoin 0.14.1, Devcoin's MM+counterparty OP\_Return 80 Byte limit for comments defying the 0.9.x Bitcoin ""Core"" slash so Counterparty can work its magic and bridge to EVM chains and back to original Bitcoin hashpower secured SHA-256 L1 chains - Devcoin would be the xDai to mint Rare Pepe's without insane minting fees on Bitcon L1 much like CryptoPunks mint on xDai as xDaiPuks but marketplaces will surely be built as its a specialty of Syscoin Platform and NEVM + Sys-Dev bridges are already in plans.

Devcoin is like a DAO. Distribution is community driven. Work is 10+ years old. People are coming back. Difficulty and distribution make it a great sidechain for BTC to utilize for when it adds its own expanded versions of NFTs, DAOS, SysCoin Markets, etc. so that the Mainnet can just be the settlement chain for all the networks around it like LN networks that build over the Segwit signature and validity data relayer parts separate from the BTC txn part of the txn tied to the Bitcoin Merkle Trees. The other parts SegWit separated allow cheap off-chain validation and proof of ownership etc cheap with only rare settlement going to court chain L1.

Anyway, just because its not a hot $ amount on a CEX like yours doesn't mean some of us carry on the layers that secure your future lucrative profits by further mining L1 coins some not even listed. Mining Tenebrix to support the first Scrypt coin in all crypto - Mining CoinyeCoin $COYE because the value of blockchain and p2p networks never dying despite going against a world wide celeb doesn't matter in this era and that's a land mark value for decentralized freedom for us node operators, the users.

Mainly, Binance,  I think you owe a little homage to why you're success has come so far and publicly. Devs that you never write of that keep [devtome.com](https://devtome.com) a doku wiki with tutorials for peanuts teaching people to use crypto since 2012. [Devcoin.org](https://Devcoin.org), the original funders of Bitcoin developers (even selling down DVC prices when complaints were made by Bitcoin devs that they wanted more lucrative BTC so we had to buy it). But we're coming back so be ready. And last time i checked a US based customer with SEC and EU approval to invest in real estate should be allowed to trade on your exchange. So why the hate?

Sys is gonna show you how long Security of the old slow SHA-256 Hash POWERED chains and distributed currencies like none other will be the basis of the Internet of Trust and DAO/Social communities that make their own money beneficiary from that early work soon enough. CZ, it's time to say the truth. For god sake you're trading the backbone of the internet ""ARPA"" 1963 (the first 3 college network with ""email"" connection and Bell Labs sponsored) with the RUB (fiat Ruble). if thats not a sign that  we can move on with the truth I'm telling you it is. Same reasons Canadians have royal charters that allow them to buy some amazing OTC stocks I luckily own but thru their pre Canadian nationhood Royal Bank of Canada or their SEC unreachable parent companies of TDA via Toronto-Dominion Bank.

>The Syscoin Ethereum Bridge is a decentralized Finance (DeFi) application that enables ERC-20 tokens to move back and forth between the Syscoin and Ethereum blockchains. This bridge can provide fast, scalable, and low-cost transactions for BUSD users, while also maintaining regulatory compliance provided by Ethereum.

The congestion [creates expensive transaction fees and slow settlement times](https://coincodex.com/article/8762/why-ethereum-developers-frustrated-by-fees-should-be-using-blockchain-bridges/). By using blockchain interoperability bridges, ERC-20 stablecoin projects can substantially reduce transaction costs and improve speed. In a quick [cost comparison](https://syscoin.org/fees/) between Ethereum and Syscoin transaction fees, ERC-20 projects can save their users thousands of dollars by reducing costs with the Syscoin blockchain,” according to a statement from Blockchain Foundry.

>Blockchain Foundry added that blockchain auditing firm Whiteblock Inc. tested the scalability of Syscoin’s Z-DAG [(Zero Confirmation Directed Acyclic Graph)](https://syscoin.org/zdag_syscoin_whitepaper.pdf) scaling technology. According to the [audit report](https://syscoin.org/tps_whiteblock_syscoin_report.pdf), Syscoin’s network can provide a burst capacity of 60,000 TPS (transactions per second) and a peak of 140,000 TPS.

Wake up Winklevosses - PAX partnership with BUSD is nothing compared to SEC untouchable Blockchain consultant and innovator (the creators of Syscoin Protocol, the public CSE:BCFN stock they are going to use to benefit the crypto project.. - you're about to get your entry into Us Equities after Canadian ADR's for Blockchain Foundry Inc. $BLFDF and the CSE trade $BCFN securities are untouchable by the SEC, the final dagger in old law to the new law - code is law - blockchain is unstoppable. Welcome CZ, Welcome Binance. Meet coins worth far more than anything you've listed and have 100's of devs who worked for peanuts to keep these secrets over a decade because theyre are building the next web, internet, and future of UBI and money for everyone to eat dinner, employers to hire, people to live in sheltered houses... thats why i love these FinTech projects. The donations aside of most of these DAOs and charity crytos back to [devcoin.org](https://devcoin.org) in 2011 - this is the way to give the world its health back, its happiness back, and its lack of concern for materialism they don't have.

I think that's why I like the Syscoin and Blockchain Foundry Inc. folks the best. They're clever geniuses and they have built everything that will make the North American supply chain and financial opportunities better for so so many people in to the south of them and I never had more pleasant encounters with people and was happier than 2013-2015 when I spent 3 hours playing baseball in Canada and absorbing all the cultural differences I could.

USDT,Binance,Stablecoin Market Trends and Report,"  

We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.

&#x200B;

The top 5 stablecoin by market cap are $USDT, $USDC, $BUSD, $DAI and $UST respectively. The first 3 stablecoins are generally similar in that they are a form of fiat-collateralised stablecoin and have a centralised backing. The latter 2 stablecoins are a form of crypto-collateralised pegged stablecoin and are also considered to be decentralised.

* Tether ($USDT) remains the most adopted stablecoin in circulation. For the case of $USDT, Tether Limited claims to back $1 worth of Tether for every $1 of USD, although there have been some controversies regarding this claim. As of July 2021, Tether executives are under federal investigation. The market cap for $USDT started to flatten in Jun 2021, but nevertheless recorded growth of 54% in Q2 2021.
* USD Coin or $USDC is the 2nd largest stablecoin by market capitalisation. $USDC is governed by Centre, a membership-based consortium that sets technical, policy and financial standards for stablecoins. $USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions, backed by fully reserved assets and is redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars according to Centre. In contrast with the decline in Tether's growth, we see a corresponding increase in $USDC's market capitalisation. $USDC market cap increased by a whopping 133% in Q2 2021, in comparison to Tether's 54%.
* Binance USD (BUSD) is the 3rd largest stablecoin by market capitalisation and is similarly a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin issued by Binance (in partnership with Paxos), and is approved and regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). $BUSD is used in the Binance Smart Chain and has also seen an uptrend in its market cap.
* $DAI uses an over-collateralised mechanism to maintain a $1 peg of $DAI to USD. Unlike the 3 aforementioned stablecoins, $DAI is a form of crypto-collateralised pegged stablecoin and is decentralised. However, much of what collateralises $DAI involves $USDC. Critics argue this means that $DAI is backed by a centralised entity, making it susceptible to centralisation risks like the 3 stablecoins described above.
* $UST is the stablecoin used within the Terra ecosystem. The $LUNA token in Terra is used to support the $UST stablecoin peg. The market cap of $UST is relatively small compared to the top stablecoins because $UST is not widely used in other blockchains but only has utility within the Terra ecosystems in protocols such as Mirror and Anchor.",1,2021-12-09 00:14:06,16

USDT,Binance,The CryptoQuestion November Bulletin - Important news roundup and free crypto resources for your listening and viewing pleasure,"**About us: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

**Market Overview**

The crypto market continues its new bull run, which re-commenced in July, hitting a new high of $2.7 trillion. Both Bitcoin and Ether also reached all time highs in October. Binance Coin, Tether and Cardano make up the top five by market cap. The Fear and Greed index currently sits at ‘Greed’, which compares to last week’s ‘Extreme Greed’ and last month’s neutral.

**Trending**

**SEC Approves Bitcoin Futures ETF**

After years of false starts the crypto industry finally got its ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). The SEC approved the ProShare Bitcoin Strategy ETF. After two days on the NYSE ProShare’s ETF became the fastest fund ever to reach $1 billion in assets under management. Physically based bitcoin ETFs, where you invest directly in bitcoin, are still waiting approval, but it is a promising start.

**SEC Chairman claims U.S won’t ban crypto**

It came as a relief to the market when Gensler the Chairman of the SEC declared that the U.S would not ban crypto but would seek to better regulate it. Although the final decision would be up to Congress. That regulation is most likely to be focused on the stablecoin market to begin with.

**Walmart enters crypto**

Walmart shoppers can now buy bitcoin at 200 kiosks in its stores. The test is with Coinstar which offers bitcoin at more than 3,000 kiosks.

**Axie Infinity creator raises $152 million**

Axie Infinity is one of the most popular play-ro-earn games on the blockchain commanding a $38 billion valuation (fully diluted). An Investment in the creator rather than the tokens is a telling sign that the tokens do not represent good value. Avoid for now.

**Memecoin mania**

Shiba Inu, the memcoin named after another dog, saw its token rocket in value before falling back after a comment from Musk that he didn't own any. But that comment didn't stop its rise and it is now valued above Dogecoin at $38 billion. Of course that has reignited the search for the next Doge or Shiba, a search we won't be embarking on.

**Squid Games pump and dump**

A token inspired by the Netflix show Squid Games saw its price spiral upwards by 380,000% on its debut. That upwards momentum continued as the price hit $2,861. However the price came crashing down as the founders cashed out with a $12 million profit and left the ‘project’. That my friends is the danger of investing in memecoins and projects with no fundamentals.

**NFT mania**

Coinbase announced it was launching an NFT marketplace focusing initially on Ethereum based NFTs.

**The good and bad of Robinhood**

Robinhood’s announcement that it was launching a crypto wallet hit the share price of Coinbase particularly after they revealed they had already signed up 1 million people to the upcoming product. However Robinhood suffered its own set back a few days later when it reported its quarterly earnings. The main cause of concern was the fall off in crypto trading from $233 million in the previous quarter to $51 million in the current. The shares tanked.

**USDC finds itself under investigation**

One of the leading stable coins, number two behind Tether, was issued with a subpoena from the SEC back in July, only recently coming to light however. It was also disclosed that the investigation continues. USDC announced it was shifting its reserves to only cash and treasuries. It is expected that the SEC will oversee the stablecoin market in the short term, something which will no doubt send shivers up the spine of Tether.

**Tether’s house of cards**

Last month we reported that the SEC is investigating Tether. This month they were hit with a $42.5 million fine by the CFTC. It was also reported in a Bloomberg expose that billions of dollars of client money has been invested in risky crypto projects, something the team at Tether initially denied but was later confirmed by Celsius who benefited from an investment of $1 billion. This is a devastating revelation and is a sure sign that if there was ever a bank run investors would suffer massive losses.

**New York targets DeFi Lending**

Both Nexus and Celsius received cease and desist letters from the New York Attorney General. Nexus and Celsius are lending platforms targeting private investors.

**Finally...**

A new survey suggests 11.4% of adults around the world own crypto. Nigeria, Malaysia and Australia have the highest rate of adoption. Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Philippines, Mexico and the US make up the top 10.

USDT,Binance,"I invite you to a thought experiment, what would be the domino effect if the largest stablecoin loses it's peg overnight?","I'm aware most of you are tired of the FUD about USDT (tether) that ramped up recently. But let's make a fun thought experiment and try to imagine the domino effect as far as possible, what would happen  if USDT  loses it's peg or even becomes clear that is worth nothing or close to nothing at 15th Jan, when is the deadline for iFinex (the parent company of Tether and Bitfinex) to submit the requested documentation to NYAG (New Your Attorney General) that US authorities requested in the middle of 2019 and iFinex has been using all possible ways to delay that until now. Few fun facts to get your thinking started with:

\- They've been delaying providing those docs for 1.5 years, given that track record I find it unlikely they will provide them now, or that they will be up to satisfaction.

\- They've been ramping USDT printing exponentially in the last 6 months, $1B tether printed just the first few days of this year. For an outsider it looks like they know shit is about to hit the fan and want to buy as much unseizable crypto assets as possible before the end.

\- Market cap when they admitted they have only 76% backing in 2018 was $2B, it's $22B now 

\- USDT is by far having the biggest trading volume against any crypto

\- Their last ""audit"" was in 2018 and it looked like a joke, they actually never provided proper audit of their reserves, never.

\- They always mint tether in big round number, like $800M just the other day. I find it hard to believe that deposits of investors always add-up to a round number. Look USDC mints for example, they are always like 23939394

\- Nobody seems to know where they bank right now? (Correct me if you know)

\- USDT is in lots of AMM DEX pools with other stables, if USDT loses it's peg and goes to $0, the other stable in that pool will lose it's peg to by going much above $1, so that even can single handedly cause all stables to lose their pegs

\- That will cause a lot of people that have borrowed other stables against crypto to be undercollaterized, which will liquadate their crypto collateral at market price, causing the price of that crypto to tank, cause other people to be under-collaterized and so on.....the domino is quite obvious here.

\- There is a lot of BTC on Ethereum in various forms, some of them based on collateral, that collateral might depreciate way too fast, what would happen to the BTC on ethereum?

\- nobody seems to have used [tether.to](https://tether.to) to  redeem USDT for USD?

\- a lot of exchanges rely heavily on USDT 

&#x200B;

One train of thought seems to be everyone will pour their depreciating USDT in crypto causing the prices to go even higher, but who will take it? Well AMM LP will be the first to suffer I suppose but what happens on  CEXes?

&#x200B;

The opposite and much harder to forsee domino effect will be the doomsday scenario, all stables losing their peg, mass liquadations, halted trading at CEXes and so on, but how far could that potentially reach effect wise? How long it can last?   
Please try to forsee the domino effect as far as possible as a fun thought experiment.

Hopefully nothing will happen at 15th or at least the US government won't react harshly knowing what that would cause, but still would be better to be prepared for all possible scenarios and excersize our thinking in the process.",5,2021-01-06 19:29:10,15

USDT,Binance,CARDANO (ADA) SET TO HIT $1.50 ON CLASSIC TRIANGLE BREAKOUT PATTERN,"KEY CARDANO TAKEAWAYS

Cardano’s ADA, now the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, maintains its top rankings as it sustains its uptrend three days in a row.

The ADA/USD exchange rate’s uptrend comes as a breakout-move of its previous Descending Triangle range.

That raises the pair’s potential to hit $1.50 in the coming sessions.

Ethereum’s top rival Cardano is on a tear.

The blockchain platform’s native asset, ADA, surged by up to 52 percent after bottoming out near $0.95 at the beginning of this week. As of Wednesday, the token has formed an intraday high of $1.45 before correcting mildly lower to the $1.35-1.44 range during the Asia-Pacific session Thursday

Traders flocked into the Cardano market after Bitcoin started correcting lower upon establishing its record high above $61,000.

ADA offered an ideal refuge against the top cryptocurrency after its listing on Coinbase Pro, a US-based digital assets trading platform. More bullish tailwinds for ADA came from the ongoing craze surrounding non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Cardano allows users to create the said assets on its blockchain following its latest “Mary” upgrade.

$1.50
Technical indicators added to the bullish confluence. The ADA/USD exchange rate’s latest move upside had it broke out of a Descending Triangle. Traders see the said structure as a bullish continuation pattern, primarily if the downside consolidation occurs after a strong move upward. ADA was trading higher before forming the Triangle.

Typically, a breakout move emerging out of a falling triangle structure leads the asset higher by as much as the maximum distance between the structure’s upper and lower trendline. In ADA’s case, the length spans about $0.47. If one adds $0.47 to the level from where the token has broken the Triangle, then the breakout target comes near $1.50.

“It is essential to note that the bullish outlook has been validated by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD),” said analysts at CoinGape, a crypto-focused YouTube channel. “The trend momentum indicator has crossed into the positive region, suggesting that the least resistance path is upward.”

Besides, the MACD line leads the way above the signal line, which is another bullish signal,” they added.

RISKS

On the flip side, the ADA/USD’s Relative Strength Indicator on the four-hour chart has entered the overbought territory. That increases the pair’s likelihood of correcting lower to neutralize short-term buying sentiments. Should a correction appear, Cardano risks correcting to its flipped resistance area of $1.26-1.29.


Meanwhile, fundamental risks also threaten to reverse ADA’s bullish course. The Cardano token has rallied majorly because of its rival Ethereum’s limitation as a blockchain project. The latter suffers from higher gas and transaction fees issues but remains committed to solve it by the end of this year through a long-awaited protocol upgrade from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.

One industry observer commented that he still has to see a single popular application operating atop the Cardano blockchain, unlike Ethereum, which boasts about projects like Tether and UniSwap. That makes ADA’s latest gains more speculative, prone to wavering.",7,2021-03-18 12:25:33,8

The year is 2022. Most companies have issued their own crypto tokens. The stock-markets NYSE, AEX, FTSE have all been shutdown after a hack which caused global markets to collapse. Those in the know speculate that the hack is just a scape-goat propagated by central banks and governments to hide the failure of fiat-currencies.

Bitcoin is still king followed by Ethereum, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Saudi Aramco, Shell and Tesla.

The crypto-markets gave grown substantially now hovering around 200 trillion tether. I could say dollars but after the historic collapse they don't have any value and are not longer noted on Coinmarketcap as an unit of account.

Bitcoin is currently trading at 130.000 and according to ""experts"" it's currently in a bear-market after tapping 250.000. Gold is hovering around 35.000 and silver around 2500. Oil is still relatively cheap at 130 and the average income is around 40.000. Wages have not kept with the crash of fiat-currencies which means that 90 percent of the citizenry are dependent on the state to receive an additional 40.000 in UBI.

The UBI is clearly not enough to support people in their lives. The state made it illegal for landlords to charge any rent after a protest-group called Renters lives Matter went on a killing spree. To compensate the landlords all houses were equipped with hightech monitoring gadgets to collect as much data as possible to sell to big tech companies.

All excess oil reserves are now being used to mine Bitcoin. Paying with bitcoin is more for the big shots nowadays. Common folks like to use fast, cheap and highly deflationary coins to transact in like Tesla, Apple or Amazon. Most companies started burning their own coins with a certain percentage of profit every quarter to incentivise hodling and tend to pay their employees in their crypto.

Off-course the big tech coins are not really just coins. They are securities like stocks used to be and are quite centralised. God only knows what would happen to the crypto securities if Bezos, Zuckerberg or Gates would suddenly die. But in general the crypto-markets have grown up and are now more stable than let's say the wild wild west days in 2017 where every billionaire could just steer the markets with some pocketchange in every desired direction.

Binance along with other crypto-exchange companies became one of the biggest beneficiaries after the closure of the global stock-markets, with a market-cap of 900 billion tether accompanying the big boys in the top 30.

USDT,Binance,Binance Suffers From $2.4 Million TurtleDex Exit Heist,"TurtleDex, a decentralized finance (DeFi) file storage on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), is believed to have pulled an exit scam yesterday. As a result, more than $2.4 million fund was drained from trading pools on major BSC DeFi exchanges like Ape Swap and Pancake Swap.

TurtleDex was launched on March 15, promoting itself as a DeFi storage platform to help users save data and files securely online. Its pre-sale that day increased 9000 BNB tokens, or about $2.4 million, in just two hours.

TurtleDex drained the liquidity funds on Ape Swap and Pancake Swap and turned their pot to ETH. Furthermore, the ETH digital asset was transferred to Binance wallets, according to Etherscan.

The alleged heist was first to be flagged up by Twitter user @DefiStalker. Also Jetfuel.Finance, a yield farming platform that tied-up with TurtleDex, showed its shock and confusion at the rug pull on Twitter.

All eyes are on Binance to lessen the loss to investors’ pockets. So far, there has been no word, but a tweet from company head, CZ, earlier this week explains that “We actually help with a few rugs pulls recently too.” Moreover, the Binance Smart Chain is a semi-closed ecosystem. It means that Binance leads the various entry and exit points to the Smart Chain. Consequently, this guarantees hard to get funds off the Smart Chain without passing under the monitoring of Binance’s central control.

USDT,Binance,Stablecoin Market Trends and Report," 

We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile)

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**  

In terms of overall market capitalisation for stablecoins, we have seen high demand and tremendous growth in the space due to the importance of the role played by stablecoins in DeFi. In Q2 2021, $BUSD experienced the largest growth in its market cap. This is likely due to the influx of users to the Binance Smart Chain due to high gas fees and network congestion on the Ethereum platform in Q1 2021. We take a closer look at the top 5 stablecoins by their market capitalisation. 

&#x200B;

The top 5 stablecoin by market cap are $USDT, $USDC, $BUSD, $DAI and $UST respectively. The first 3 stablecoins are generally similar in that they are a form of fiat-collateralised stablecoin and have a centralised backing. The latter 2 stablecoins are a form of crypto-collateralised pegged stablecoin and are also considered to be decentralised.

* Tether ($USDT) remains the most adopted stablecoin in circulation. For the case of $USDT, Tether Limited claims to back $1 worth of Tether for every $1 of USD, although there have been some controversies regarding this claim. As of July 2021, Tether executives are under federal investigation. The market cap for $USDT started to flatten in Jun 2021, but nevertheless recorded growth of 54% in Q2 2021.
* USD Coin or $USDC is the 2nd largest stablecoin by market capitalisation. $USDC is governed by Centre, a membership-based consortium that sets technical, policy and financial standards for stablecoins. $USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions, backed by fully reserved assets and is redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars according to Centre. In contrast with the decline in Tether's growth, we see a corresponding increase in $USDC's market capitalisation. $USDC market cap increased by a whopping 133% in Q2 2021, in comparison to Tether's 54%.
* Binance USD (BUSD) is the 3rd largest stablecoin by market capitalisation and is similarly a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin issued by Binance (in partnership with Paxos), and is approved and regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). $BUSD is used in the Binance Smart Chain and has also seen an uptrend in its market cap.
* $DAI uses an over-collateralised mechanism to maintain a $1 peg of $DAI to USD. Unlike the 3 aforementioned stablecoins, $DAI is a form of crypto-collateralised pegged stablecoin and is decentralised. However, much of what collateralises $DAI involves $USDC. Critics argue this means that $DAI is backed by a centralised entity, making it susceptible to centralisation risks like the 3 stablecoins described above.
* $UST is the stablecoin used within the Terra ecosystem. The $LUNA token in Terra is used to support the $UST stablecoin peg. The market cap of $UST is relatively small compared to the top stablecoins because $UST is not widely used in other blockchains but only has utility within the Terra ecosystems in protocols such as Mirror and Anchor.

 

Algorithmic stablecoins are starting to develop this year but overall there are not too many outstanding projects. Stablecoins under the Rebase/Seignorage type models has not really performed in terms of maintaining their peg. Most of them have been priced below the peg price for a long time despite measures of price equalisation such as $ESD, $DSD and $BAC.

$FRAX, $UST and $sUSD are stablecoins with pretty good performance when it comes to keeping relative stability against the 1 US dollar. However, $AMPL, although dynamic around $1, has a very large fluctuation.

### Stablecoin Supply Ratio

Cryptoquant recorded an ATL for the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR), which measures $BTC market capitalisation relative to the total stablecoin supply to estimate purchasing power in the stablecoin market. Accordingly, when the price of $BTC falls, the amount of stablecoin purchases will increase to push the price of $BTC up and vice versa. But the growth of stablecoin supply in the spring of 2020 and 2021 has kept SSR near historic lows. This shows that demand for $USDT seems to keep pace with the demand for $BTC",0,2021-11-01 23:11:32,3
USDT,Binance,"SmartChain, dumbest blockchain","Due to Binances idiotic minimum transfer amount of 0.05BNB currently, it's genuinely hard to defend this coin and platform. I have Tether stuck in my Trust Wallet in a sort of limbo because I don't have enough SmartChain to cover the fees to convert or send, that part I have no issue with, every blockchain uses it's native coin for fees. But the stupidest part is how to get it. 

Current minimum withdrawal of BNB on the app is 0.05 which is roughly just under $23. Just think about it, if you have say $15 of a BEP20 coin and want to convert it to something else. You'd have to buy $23 worth of BNB just to meet the minimum limit so that you can cover the $0.16 fee of SmartChain. Utterly ridiculous.

USDT,Binance,Noob Question On Buying Crypto,"Hi. I'm new to Binance and crypto in general, and I have what is probably a very basic question but one that I can't seem to find an answer to and I'm a little confused. I watched some youtube videos and looked at explanations but still...

When you are bying crypto through Binance, what is the right/best way to go about it?

I got really confused at first and deposited some money to my wallet, then I realized I can't figure out how exactly to spend it, so I withdrew it back... (>.<) Later, I bought crypto directly with a debit card but something still bugs me...

When you buy directly with a card, it seems a little more expensive than if you went to the trading screen and bought at lowest current offer. Is this due to the Binance transaction fee? So if you wanted to actually ""trade"", you would have to first buy BUSD or USDT, at which point the same fee applies? So there's no difference between buying tether and then trading or just buying directly with a card? Other than, when trading you can obviously use the order book.",2,2021-08-25 21:21:17,4

USDT,Binance,Why can't a stablecoin have unlimited supply ?,"There has always been a big discussion about Tether and their reserves, or lack of. This week, it all started again. Same thing.

&#x200B;

I agree with the fact that they should be honest and let a 3rd party do a proper audit. If they promised that 1 USDT would backed by 1 USD then they have to be able to prove they have those USDs in their bank account. It should be clear. Period.

&#x200B;

Now let's forget about Tether and let's focus on why do stable coins exist. What is the point of having a stable coin? The whole point is so that you can trade your crypto for it if you fear the market would crash. You can keep it in a stable coin without having to put it in your bank account.

&#x200B;

What I care as a crypto trader is that the stable coin actually delivers on the promise of keeping it's value constant. That's all I care as a crypto trader. That the value stays the same. 1 stable coin equals 1 USD today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

&#x200B;

The problem with Tether is that they laid about their promise of keeping a 1 on 1 reserve.

&#x200B;

But what if they wouldn't have had this 1 on 1 pegged promise.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What if they would have said instead, from the bigining: we have created a stable coin, it's pegged 1 to 1 with the US dollar. We don't keep reserves of USD. Why? Because we don't need to. Our promise to you is that 1 USDT will always equal 1 USD. We achieve that by using an oracle that always matches the price of USDT to the price of USD. That's it.

&#x200B;

We will also have an uncapped supply. Does that impact you as a holder of USDT? No, it doesn't. Remember that the price will always be 1 USDT = 1 USD

&#x200B;

Would that work in practice?

Stablecoins were born with the noble function of resisting the strong volatility of other cryptos. However, not all efforts have been fruitful.

&#x200B;

Stablecoins are now being used to exchange and pay more frequently than $BTC and $ETH . Velocity measures the rate of average trading volume against the market capitalisation.

A high velocity means that the cryptocurrency is widely traded within the economy.

$USDT and $BUSD have the highest speed, ranging from 1.0 to 3.0. Given the dominance of Binance as the top exchange and the rise of its blockchain (BSC), it is no surprise that $BUSD is being most widely used after $USDT.

&#x200B;

According to statistics, Ethereum is still the top blockchain, accounting for more than 70% of stablecoins in the market as of January 2021. Tron, Omni, and Terra are next — proving that the stablecoin market is very active and the algo-stablecoin space is growing beyond just $UST.",2,2021-09-23 23:47:33,2
USDT,Binance,Binance VISA CARD usage," Hello Binancians! Does somebody here BINANCE VISA CARD? I would like to ask you two questions:

1. If I understand that correctly, you are basically able to pay with your crypto anywhere, even in the stores, where they do not accept crypto. They must however accept visa card. You just have some amount of crypto on your card balance and it will automatically convert into fiat and you pay with it. Am I correct?
2. If I am, I have a question if you think if it would be better to make all payments with Tether (the stablecoin), or would you use BTC, ETH, or BNBs?

USDT,Binance,Canadian citizen locked out of Binance.com because of US IP on VIN,"I read these locked-out posts all the time but never thought it would happen to me. 

I've had a Binance account since 2017 with no problems. 

I'm a Canadian citizen and completed KYC identify verification with passport , photo, video, and proof of address. 

I live in Asia and used my account here without issue until a couple of weeks ago when I started getting messages saying I'm using a US IP address. I haven't ever lived in the US an I am not there now. I use a VPN but I don't use US IP, maybe I did once or twice without realizing it.

Today customer chat confirmed I am locked out of my account which holds over 15K in altcoins. The chat person Vicky says I have to immediately withdraw my funds, but I am locked out of converting altcoins to BTC or tether.

I don't have wallets for the small coins and don't know how to deal with this. 

She said they will temporarily unlock my account to let me convert them but first she needs me to send a video holding my CANADIAN PASSPORT to prove my identity......... 

So I am being locked out for being in the US and now I have to show my Canadian passport in order to be allowed to withdraw my funds and close my account?? makes no sense.  


There's no point in fighting it so I sent the proof and now the chat has gone silent. No reply since then.

The US could do it at a stroke by confiscating the BUSD account with PAXOS worth nearly 10 billion. I think it unlikely, so I think the Americans will go after Tether first, for doing the exact same thing they do to their own currency (the irony). This will wipe out loads of people trading the Tether pairs. If I was CZ, I would be quietly reducing the available USDT pairs by 10 a day on Binance and incentivising BUSD and USDC pairs and then just drop USDT altogether allowing people to convert to another stable for free for the first 48h and then give the remaining USDT holders 1 week to move them off exchange. I think CZ can play nice to the yanks by being proactive on Tether, paying some fines, dropping some services (like he did today), and the ultimate sweetener quietly handing over all the trading details of all the yanks that ever used Binance.com to the IRS after first forcing registration on all remaining accounts just to weed out any lurking unregistered yanks using VPNs. If any are found just turn their account balances over to their tax agency and let them deal with their own.

# What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

# Why We Need Stablecoin

>Stay tuned for our algo stablecoin research paper coming out! It is a collaboration between Economics Design, Lemniscap VC and Bocconi University.

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

>“Stablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to”.

# Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

## Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

## Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

## Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa — when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins of this type: Carbon, Steeem Dollar, Bitpay Officical, Nubits.",1,2021-10-16 00:28:55,1

USDT,Binance,"BEP2, BEP20, ERC20, OMNI & TRC20 networks – What’s the difference?","BEP-2 | ERC-20 |TRC-20 | OMNI

A year ago when Binance launched Binance chain they also announced a feature that allows interoperable deposits and withdrawals. Meaning you can deposit an ERC-20 Token to your Binance account and withdraw as BEP-2 Token and vice versa.

For example you can deposit Chain Link or Matic which is an ERC20 token (from Ethereum Chain) to your Binance account and withdraw them as BEP2 token (to Binance Chain).

However the address for both the network is different.

BEP2 – Token on Binance chain starts with bnb136ns6lfw4zs5hg4n85vdthaad7hq5m4gtkgf23

ERC20 – Token on Ethereum chain starts with 0x0e806cea8e5beba6df97354ef7f22b66c5a2ce82

Likewise the address for OMNI and TRC20 is also different.

OMNI – Token on Omni layer network starts with 1JKhrVV9EsgSS5crXLBo9BRVXyuHjf2Tcp

TRC20 is a token standard on TRON network and their address starts with TWsVAb9EWAgKdumTD7XoEdkvs7AoyvkgN7

Also BEP-2 address requires the use of MEMO which is not needed for OMNI, TRC20 or ERC-20 deposits and withdrawals. So there shouldn’t much confusion when depositing or withdrawing your tokens.

Even when you input the wrong address the exchange will warn you with the following message.

“The address does not match the currently selected network, it is recommended that you switch to another network.”

Likewise when you are sending coins / tokens from your wallet you’ll get “Recipient address is invalid” error message if you input an incorrect address.

But now things got little confusing for many newbies after Binance launched BSC (Binance Smart Chain) and opened deposit and withdrawal option for BEP20 tokens.

BEP 20 Token

BEP 20 option is now available for major assets like BTC, ETH, USDT, LINK, DOT, DAI, EOS, LTC, XRP, XTZ, BCH, BAND, ADA, ONT etc.

So now when you are depositing or withdrawing any of these coins you’ll be asked to choose the network type.

Once you input your wallet address or the recipients address for withdrawal the exchange will automatically select the network based on the address entered.

But what’s more confusing is that both BEP 20 and ERC 20 share the same address format. Also they’ve listed ETH as ERC20. Hope Binance changes this soon to avoid confusion.

(ETH is neither ERC20, BEP2 or BEP20. ETH is a native coin on its own chain. ERC 20 is a token on ETH chain and BEP 2, BEP 20 is a token on Binance chain and Binance smart chain respectively)

So what is the difference between these two networks, why BEP 20 uses same address as ERC 20 and which one should I choose when transferring ETH or other coins?

Here we’ll not get into the technical specifications of the token standard. Instead we’ll just explain the basics of these network types and give a quick introduction to pegged tokens.

BEP20 Network – Binance smart chain

Binance smart chain is a parallel Binance chain designed to enable smart contracts and it comes with an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible environment.

It is never meant to compete with Ethereum or replace ETH. BSC is just an ETH-compatible chain and is designed to give users more options such as fast block times, cheap transaction costs etc.

Users will now be able to transfer the same asset (ERC20 token) in shorter time and at surprisingly low cost (low gas price) on Binance smart chain (BEP20 token). These are called pegged tokens.

Pegged tokens?

Pegged tokens are a type of token that will have its value tied to the original crypto.

For example Chain Link (ERC-20) token will be pegged at 1:1 ratio with Chain Link (BEP-20) token. Not only ERC 20 tokens, but even tokenized versions of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tether (USDT)  are available on Binance smart chain.

The purpose of these tokens is to allow trading assets on DEXs and benefit from the speed and transactional efficiency of the new blockchain.

These coins and tokens are wrapped and pegged by Binance on 1:1 ratio to the corresponding native cryptocurrency.

On Binance scan explorer you can find the full list of Binance pegged tokens (BEP 20) and their contract address.

Bsc Scan: https://bscscan.com/tokens/label/binance-pegged


These tokens are currently traded on Binance and  Binance DEX. You can transfer to and from Binance.com and can swap it for their native assets anytime.

Also Trust wallet is the only wallet that currently supports BEP20 token standards. Other than that you can enable Binance smart chain on your Metamask wallet which we’ll explain in another guide.

What is the difference between BEP-2, BEP-20 and ERC-20?

Most of the popular tokens today are ERC 20 tokens that are build on Ethereum. If you are quite confused then visit CoinMarketCap and you should be able to figure out whether a token is built on Ethereum blockchain or Binance chain.


ERC-20 is a technical standard for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for tokens.

BEP-2 is a technical standard for implementing and launching tokens on the Binance blockchain.

BEP 20 represents a token standard on Binance smart chain.

This is all you need to understand:

ERC20 – Ethereum chain

BEP 2 – Binance chain.

BEP 20 – Binance smart chain

For example if you choose BEP 20 as network and withdraw your ERC 20 token then the tx will be visible on Bsc scan and not Etherscan. It’s because you withdrew it to Binance chain and not Ethereum chain.

So when depositing or withdrawing make sure to choose the right intended network. Ensure that you use the correct chain that the platform supports.

If you require assistance or quite confused then we recommend you to contact Binance support.

Hope it helps.

USDT,Binance,The CryptoQuestion October Bulletin,"**About us: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

**Market Overview**

September has been a pretty negative month with the overall market seeing its value decline by 7%. The fear and greed index slipped back into extreme fear and now sits at fear. However there are reasons to be positive. Firstly the Chairman of the Fed, Jerome Powell, told congress he did not intend to ban crypto currency, although he said stablecoins needed greater regulatory oversight. Secondly, the massive recent negativity surrounding China’s ban on crypto looks to have been overdone as usual. It is evident that the Chinese crypto enthusiast has no intention of letting the crypto revolution pass him by. It appears as though they have started trading through DEX’s as witnessed by the surge in trade on Dydx. Finally the Chair of the SEC said that he supported a bitcoin ETF, another positive step forward for the industry. So all in all a positive week.

**Trending**

**Regulators target DeFi**

The SEC is investigating Uniswap Labs, the organization behind the leading DEX Uniswap. It is early days yet but is a sign of things to come. That news was followed by the announcement that New Jersey had served a cease and desist order on Celsius, a leading yield farming platform which advertises, ‘earn 17% yield on your crypto’. Alabama and Texas are also looking at doing the same. Both Celsius and Uniswap rolled out the same statement that they are willing to work with regulators. Finally, Coinbase was told in no uncertain terms that if they continued with their plans to launch a lending platform the SEC would sue. Whilst Coinbase continued to deny that lending represented a regulated activity, they had no choice but to shelve or bin their proposals.

Check out our [Staking and Yield Farming Review](https://medium.com/the-capital/weekly-staking-and-yield-farming-review-23rd-september-2021-6904585050c4) which sets out our thinking on these regulatory actions and what strategy investors should follow.

**The UK’s Post Office enters crypto**

Yes you heard it right! The Post Office announced that its app can be used to connect to a decentralized exchange called Swarm Markets, from there vouchers can be purchased that are redeemable for crypto. British politicians were up in arms about the announcement. The fully diluted market cap of Swarm is a modest $70 million, could be worth a closer look assuming the unhappy politicians don’t get their way.

**That old chestnut - China**

The recent stumble in the crypto market was blamed on China’s now outright ban of crypto no doubt to protect it’s digital yuan which it is rolling out. This should be no surprise. China has been tough on crypto for some time, the only surprise is this didn't happen sooner. Crypto will do just fine without China.

**Binance again**

Every month there is never any shortage of negative stories to write about when it comes to Binance’s trials and tribulations. This month saw the announcement that both the IRS and the DOJ are investigating. It is reported that this is for market manipulation and insider trading. Binance also announced it was withdrawing from yet another market, Singapore. We do hope that investors who use Binance’s central wallet have started to move their crypto into their own wallet.

**Robinhood and PayPal**

Robinhood announced that they were rolling out a crypto wallet with transfer features allowing customers to store crypto and move in and out of their apps. The market considers Robinhood a serious threat to Coinbase’s business with this move. Meanwhile back in the grey and damp UK PayPal announced they were introducing crypto trading services through their PayPal accounts. Of course there is a limited selection of coins available including the Bitcoin fork Bitcoin Cash valued at a ridiculous $10 billion.

**Cardano introducing its own stablecoin**

September saw the launch of the much anticipated and long overdue smart contract functionality on the Cardano blockchain. Named the Djed, it is an algorithmic stablecoin as compared to one backed by fiat. Its new stable coin is expected to make transaction costs on the Cardano network cheaper and more predictable. Its announcement comes at a time when US regulators are considering regulating or banning stablecoins.

**Finally…**

There is talk that the SEC is investigating Tether, the leading stablecoin player. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone following the shenanigans at Tether over their total lack of transparency since inception. There have been multiple reports of investigations into breaching banking and security laws.

USDT,Binance,Futures from Italy w/o personal identification?,"I've been verified since day 0 as an Italian user and traded futures for two years now.

After the Italian ban, I wish to continue trading derivatives on Binance as the offers from competing exchanges are riskier, prevalently require to hold the entire margin in Tether and generally have thinner / more volatile order books.

For the time being, keeping my trading on Binance as a newly-registered unverified user would also buy me time while I diversify over alternative exchanges.

Do you know by experience if this is technically possible, or identification is required for derivatives?",2,2021-07-31 00:11:39,1
USDT,Binance,"PSA: For anyone thinking of ""cashing in"" by buying a coin that's newly listed to Binance ON Binance: that's a fool's errand.","Unless you get it at it's actual opening price, which is nearly impossible, you're going to lose a LOT of money. (See any coin listed on Binance and how much they get pumped to the moon initially.) The majority of Binance traders aren't very smart, and will pay basically any price for any coin when it gets listed.

(See BCN's listing, which was the absolute best/worst example of this.)

There were buyers spending *THOUSANDS* of dollars buying TrueUSD at $1.04, which is a coin (like Tether) that's always supposed to equal exactly one US dollar.  
(The pure stupidity of some Binance traders REALLY amazes me at times, but that TUSD thing *really* showed me how bad it can be.).

USDT,Binance,Missing VLK coins on BscScan and can't figure out how to account for them,"Any help is greatly appreciated!

I invested in Vulkania (VLK) via Pancakeswap, and made some gains. I triggered a total of five trades between May 5, 2021 and Aug 14, 2021. The first four trades were purchases of VLK in exchange for Wrapped BNB, and the last trade was where I sold all of my VLK for Binance-Peg Tether (BSC-USD). 

The reason I am confused is because the sum-total amount of VLK that I purchased over the first four trades is ≈ 172.1023 VLK more than what I sold on 8/14/2021. However, when I look in my wallet, it shows I have 0.00 VLK. So where did this 172.1023 VLK disappear to? 

Here are the five transaction details and their transaction hashes:

1. Bought 7,889.61219805 VLK for 2 WBNB on 5/5/2021
   1. 0xc0775ddb98f7eb28a24a56b7bb267a2241f7acb0e6eb3e921b685e304ba0d001
2. Bought 2,868.45676189 VLK for 1.186555595 WBNB on 5/7/2021
   1. 0xf68c739d910d45b71d2eccf8bd98c95151767033ccbc1e70b0b8763fc9dcc2d3
3. Bought 7,383.72131992 VLK for 3 WBNB on 5/9/2021
   1. 0x8ea8f928f6449a351a7c0a64df0211f79f304e0d71bef935db11e68494324184
4. Bought 3,453.36011961 VLK for 1 WBNB on 5/21/2021
   1. 0xf1b6e0f234f29a89052b33d0bc886f9eea646309e580adc483b2845d40212e76
5. Sold 21,423.04809304 VLK for  9,238.188710810378020553 BSC-USD (via WBNB)
   1. 0x9dc76a60eb07205de7cd7772b37d10a8aebb9bbdbfeec75b31fca76dbad64730

Notice that when you add the VLK up in #1 to #4, you get 21,595.15039947, but the total VLK in #5 is 21,423.04809304. The difference between these two numbers is 172.102306429999. I would expect to see this in my wallet, but my wallet is showing 0.00 VLK.

I have gone through all of my transactions on BscScan, too, just to make sure I did not miss any VLK trades, and I have not. Plus the missing amount of VLK is so small, that it wouldn't be an amount I would have traded.",1,2021-09-05 06:51:03,0
USDT,Binance,Binance fees?,"Hello,

I'm having several questions about the Binance system.

Let's assume that I have 100 USDT of my Binance account.

If I convert this 100 USDT to BTC for example. Which fees are applied?

I mean It's like that 100 USDT are moved from my address to another address which mean transaction fees must be applied by the tether network. Then it I want to convert my BTC to Eth, transaction fees must be applied again?

Is that the case on Binance or I'm missing something?

Since I performed multiple conversions and It seems that It happens instantly. 

How is that?",1,2021-01-28 14:23:58,4

Was told I needed to wait until all 8 where done and binance would send it all together after all 8 where done I was told it was being run through compliance and then communication changed they told me to get a lawyer involved. I have done so and they have not responded to the lawyer once. Now when I contact Customer support they cannot find my account or any trace of the transactions.... did someone from customer service steal my funds and hide their tracks?

Then after 4 days, he just stole 18k USDT in private wallet using the private key after i withdraw from binance and transferred to his binance wallet.

Now what i have is
USDT withdrawl history(which is transferred to my private wallet) on binance,
Scam chat link,
Suspect’s identity(name, phone, sns, etc)

The suspect’s identity is real not fake shitty id.
Suspect already caught once 2 years ago by his country police for similar reason(internet fraud)
And now he is trying to unlock his account saying he is innocent on his twitter but he can’t even prove where the fund is from(my wallets are never related to suspect even before this case)

Now what i wanna find who had same experience like me, and know what should i do to get the funds back.

Sorry for my bad english i’m not a native

Details of this case to warn other users on reddit

I was trying to swap mainnet IOTX(which is on binance) to erc20 to prepare trading in coinbase pro.

And there was problem on swapping tokens and this problem was on everybody trying to swap.

So i tried to find IOTX Support team on telegram group and got scammed

I know i’m fucking stupid, but wants to warn redditors to be aware of it.

Funds is still alive and suspect can’t do anythings cuz his account is frozen now and he can’t unlock cuz he can’t prove where the funds are from.

USDT,Binance,Binance scammed me 1516 USDT with unethical verification requests! Stay Away from this Scam Exchance!,"I woud like here to point how BINANCE scammed me 1516 USD with some bullshit and unethical requests.

**What happened?**

On 2019-12-20 I registered a binance account. I choosed to not verify my account as the limits of 2 BTC were more than enough for me!

I deposited same day 0.21 BTC and sold it for USDT.

Since I didn't use my account. On March 30 I logged in from a new computer. The system sent me an email to authorize the new device. This was done successfully.

Later I tried to withdraw around 700 USD worth of BTC. The request was cancelled an the sytem asked me to verify my identiy. What???? What's the purpose of using unverified account????? So whenever I change my machine and login, I will have to submit my documents??

Meanwhile I had some discussion with live support, who tried to help. Finally, I have been told that I have no other choice than doing the full verification. I decided then to do the verification which was done finally successfully.

You can see here:

&#x200B;

I spoke again with the support, they told me that I can try again, now that I'm fully verified, I can withdraw my funds.

&#x200B;

So I tried again to withdraw some BTC, first the status for ""Waiting for approval"" then later it changed ""Rejected"" with  the info ""Withdraw rejected. Risk control"". What???

I contacted again the support and I have been told that I will receive an email from Binance within few hours.

Almost 20hrs passed, nothing from Binance. So I opened a Ticket.

 u/ilir_binance  2821529 # is Ticket number for reference! Ticket was opened on 03/31/2020 (12 days ago by the time of writing this post).

Next day I received an answer from Binance support. And look what these people are asking me:

>Dear user,  
>  
>  
>  
>Thanks for reaching out,  
>  
>  
>  
>We apologize for the delay in response due to the high volume of requests. As per checking, we found that the withdraw function was suspended due to the withdrawal risk control. We are willing to help you resume the withdrawal of your account. However, we may need some information to make progress.

>  
>  
>Security questions:  
>  
>1. Account registration date  
>  
>2. Account registration IP  
>  
>3. Device information 

So far this is not a problem to provide. I already provided this.

Furthermore, they asked me to record a video :

>A video of the first deposit you made to your Binance account. The video would contain the login process (do NOT show password) of the platform/wallet where you made this transaction to your Binance account, find the transaction and show us the full TxID, date and amount information. 

Seriously?????? These were parts of my answer to them, same day:

>Hello guys,  
>  
>Thank you for your reply, but I'm sorry to say that what you are asking is absolutely unethical, but it's okay. Your Kingdom, Your rules. I'm happy to solve this issue, take out my money out and never use again your terrible exchange.

>Are you kidding me??????

>It was not a platform, I remember I used a wallet, but I dont remember which one anymore. I checked all my current wallets and I couldn't find this transaction.  
>  
>It was this transaction based on my deposit history:[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/)....

&#x200B;

**So they basically are asking me things that they know I can't provide and so would get a way to keep my money.** 

&#x200B;

I asked them if it will be enough to provide anything else and close this case.

>I will request then to withdraw all my coins and after that I will request you to close my account.  
>  
>I will never use again your service.  
>  
>I look forward to reading you soon, as we can close this case.

&#x200B;

**Since there have been no answer from their support! I sent few email to remind them, there was simply no answer!**

So this was my last email to them, 5 days ago:

Still today, I didn't get any answer.  


I want to let everyone know about this. If this company is not a scam, I'm asking them to let me withdraw my money simply.

What am I missing?

updates, thanks for giving me some info on things to look into here is what my understanding at this time which may or may not be correct is:

USDT on binance isn't really USDT.  The name of the coin implies it is pegged, not wrapped: Binance-Peg BSC-USD (BSC-USD).  This is very confusing as many exchanges list it as USDT..

https://www.bscscan.com/token/0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955?a=0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955 at the time of writing this it shows total supply of 4,979,997,922.

I have contacted support to ask where they keep the reserve or if that information is public.  I am assuming it is.  As far as I can tell binance offers this bridge product https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/introducing-binance-bridge-20-421499824684903626 

When searching around for their reserve wallet I did find: https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/wallet/Binance-BTCB-Reserve but this is for their BTCB.

it was listed on binance that there is 2 fees for future transaction, which is transaction fee (maker/taker) and funding fee  


i then tried out to open a short position on SOL while using isolated margin, risking 10 usdt per trade as a sl   


i open a position at 33.59 /sol and bought 12 SOL, and the liquidation price was 34.1577, i want to have a 1:1 RR so i caclulate the price difference  which is a .5677 price difference  


and then if i put my tp at 33.59 - .5677 which is at 33.0223, i only gain around $7   


so basically im risking $10 to get $7, am i missing something? i use 50x leverage if that have any impact on the fees?   


my fee calc  
$400 \* .0004 (maker fee) = $.16  
no funding fee.  


the fee should be $.16 and not $3?

Binance changed the APY/ APR suddenly on BUSDs and USDTs and using all kind of difficult terms and schemes, but it looks like the % interests have massively dropped. Am I right?",1,2023-02-25 17:07:19,5
USDT,Binance,623 USDT gone from my spot wallet,"Yesterday I set up a sell order for some BNB and it went through today in the morning, and it was even added to my portfolio app automatically. Now I just checked my spot wallet and my USDT is literally at 00000000, which shouldn't even be possible as there were a few cents even before the trade. The BNB is also gone, so the transaction did go through.

There's absolutely nothing in the withdraw log as well for USDT, it's completely gone with no trace at all.

Support hasn't helped me. What do I do?

USDT,Binance,BSC: Strange smart contract leads to an external transfer of a zero amount USDT to someone's address and vice versa even for binance hot wallets,"There is a smart-contract on Binance Smart Chain was created by someone on 11/21/2022

[https://bscscan.com/address/0x7cebeb6035b231a73cb5fb4119c2fbbc04ec6fd1](https://bscscan.com/address/0x7cebeb6035b231a73cb5fb4119c2fbbc04ec6fd1)

&#x200B;

Someone activates a contract by sending 0 from address 0xBAA1451bE8C33998CD43F375c2e67E79c1a104AD to contract 0x7ceBeb6035B231A73CB5Fb4119c2FbBC04Ec6fD1, resulting in multiple transfers back and forth to different addresses in the transaction

* From Binance: Hot Wallet 10To 0x89db137bd243c9d56981b3f82a62f3a11eb769bc For 0 ($0.00) Binance-Peg ... (BSC-US...)
* From 0x89db137bd243c9d56981b3f82a62f3a11eb769bcTo Binance: Hot Wallet 10 For 0 ($0.00) Binance-Peg ... (BSC-US...)

In the first transaction, such zero-sum transfers were even wallet binance

&#x200B;

Moreover there is more such contracts right now and a lot of zero amount USDT transfers transactions

Prior to 2022-11-21, any Binance hot wallets never sent zero amounts of USDT, now it has become massive
