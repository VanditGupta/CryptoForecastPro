XRP,cryptocurrency,Convince me that Ripple (XRP) is not a Ponzi Scheme…,"Out of all the big players in the crypto landscape, Ripple stands out to me as a Charlatan.

A for profit company that is trying to get banks and central banks to adopt its currency. Banks and central banks will be the last to adopt crypto and will only adopt something that the masses use.

This company only has a billion dollars in cash, has 1100 employees, and the rest of its assets, purportedly 25 billion, is in mostly ripple.

So essentially anytime the price goes up they are incentivized to sell Ripple from the balance sheet to help cover cost. What I don’t get is the ripple market cap is suppose to be 27 billion on top of all this per coin-market-cap.

What am I missing here?",288,2024-07-01 07:08:59,554
XRP,cryptocurrency,SEC vs Ripple case ends: Ripple must pay 125 million dollars,"Judge Torres has made her final ruling in the SEC vs Ripple case, with a judgement that Ripple must pay fines/ penalties of just over 125 million dollars. This is much less than the 2 billion dollars the SEC was asking for.

This means the case is now over, though either side can appeal. If that happens, it could take a couple of years to resolve. However, the SEC cannot appeal the ruling that XRP is inherently not a security.

XRP,cryptocurrency,Ripple (XRP) is a different animal compared to other cryptos,"Since XRP is quite old by today's standards, many people believe and trade it like any other crypto. But XRP has a complete different approach to the technology and should be therefore also treated differently.

Ripple is not only a chain, but has a for profit corporation behind it. Its business model is based on fiat to fiat money transfer with XRP as an intermediate token. For this to properly work the price of the coin is irrelevant, but its liquidity is important. To achieve this, the Ripple Corporation can mint and burn XRP on it own as they seem fit.

People buying just the token are just getting the excess the corporation does not use anymore. On the other hand, the Ripple Corporation is directly funded through these sales. But once they are sold, they have no value to the business model. They don't need to buy some for liquidity, they can just mint some more. To be more clear, by buying XRP one does not participate in the success of Ripple just funding their operations. Quite some one sided business.

To answer some obvious questions: the time frame for the fiat to fiat transfer is short enough, so that price changes for XRP are irrelevant. Blockchain technology is used for having a ledger that holds all transactions in a simple and seamless way. It is also obvious that the corporation has no interest in decentralization or development of its chain technology. Naturaly, its business model creates some serious volume on the chain which may make it look like being ""legit"".

If do not want to fund this corporation without benefits, then you probably don't want to trade XRP.",0,2024-07-17 19:54:31,49

XRP,cryptocurrency,Losing faith in XRP,"I'm just going on stupid rant. I started out fully supporting XRP but as times goes on nothing happens. Even winning against SEC more than one time didn't do a thing to the price. 

People claimed few months back that Brics are going use XRP to counter American dollar. Didn't happen acourse. I didn't believe in that in the first place. XRP fan base went so far to say Elon Musk going announced XRP as foundation for X.  After speculation after speculation, it's never ending thing. To get to the point XRP is starting to seem like hype coin at this point. It's all talk but no action what so ever. At this moment I'm talking about XRP, even Cardano is about to be worth more than XRP by price. Even messy Solana surpassed XRP by a good margin now. After court date after another, nothing happens with XRP. It's just Ripple this, Ripple that and recently Ripple is apparently partnering with a major US Bank. Which I highly doubt it because there barely any legit sources talking about it. Just another hype coin slowly dying out but let's see how it goes after February, even after Bitcoin Halving around April. If nothing happens then I don't know how to feel about XRP anymore..",678,2024-01-30 15:06:40,1103
XRP,cryptocurrency,Ripple is funding propaganda against Bitcoin by teaming up with the government to spread energy FUD,"Ripple labs has been funding ""research"" along with government entities to spread propaganda against Bitcoin and mining. 

In 2021, they funded a hit piece that claims energy prices for consumers in New York has increased by $6 per month because of mining. 

[Claim: Mining drives up household electricity bills](https://preview.redd.it/m0ta2tae4xb81.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=8079d16b0fde7bc74ebd204d4362ff823da26d3f)

Surely its not the soaring costs of natural gas that is driving up electricity prices, but mining? 

[Since June 2020, Natural gas prices have gone up by 350&#37; in the USA \(Henry Hub natural gas futures rolling contracts\)](https://preview.redd.it/iprxvhfj5xb81.jpg?width=2610&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4da2516b82eb585706d4d1af417320b5b82889e)

[Not just in USA, in UK, natural gas is at decadal highs. ](https://preview.redd.it/v2gl6rmx3xb81.jpg?width=3094&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dae03fee6dfbbfaf58df82519db809462d01254)

Surely, electricity prices that consumers pay have nothing whatsoever to do with inflation, or soaring gas prices that are in decadal highs.. but is due to bitcoin mining?!

Crude oil WTI futures are currently at 84, for comparison it was around 56 in Nov 2019 (pre pandemic). The last time WTI was above 80 was all the way back in 2014. Increasing crude oil natural gas prices, along with inflation that is at multi-decade high is not the reason for increase in household electricity, but its bitcoin mining that is responsible.. 

[Thats according to this study funded by Ripple in collusion with the Department of Treasury. ](https://preview.redd.it/a4z5aqnyaxb81.jpg?width=1944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6656489541bece07a0e9b83837d42345157f987c)... The same Department of Treasury headed by another well known Bitcoin hater Janet Yellen, who earned $7m as ""speaking fee"" from the same banks she is supposed to regulate but has tried to stifle Bitcoin and crypto at every opportunity. 

Research with ""financial support"" is nothing but propaganda, especially when it's funded by a competitor to bitcoin that lobbies with the government. Ripple continues to be a centralised premine scam created to enrich its founders. 

Ripple has also cozied up with the likes of WEF, the very organisations Bitcoin was created as a fuck you to. [https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple](https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple)

As its price and narrative around the shitcoin has stagnated, Ripple is resorting to dirty political tricks to get a leg up. As usual, they will fail. 

The narrative that bitcoin mining companies cause increase in electricity bills in NY is rubbish, as the largest BTC mining companies in New York produce their own energy. Infact the last one to start mining in NY is a hydro electric plant that was unused for years, before they started mining Bitcoin last year. 

[https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php)

The other large mining company Greenidge Generation also produces its own energy.


Edit: Buttcoin losers in comments say ""reee bitcoin move to POS or govt will ban it""

Yeah not too bright, the whole point of Bitcoin is that it cant be banned unlike the proof of stake shitcoins you support that can be created out of thin air at the press of a button and shut down at the press of a button.

Another one who is literally a war monger calling for Ukraine invasion but pretends to care about global e-waste. Lmao. Bitcoin haters are really a funny bunch


Edit: Ripple shills keep brigading and claiming where is the paper, of course if you are as bricked as a ripple fan boy you need to be spoon fed everything. Well here is the paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779720

And if you open up the first page of it, says

> **Benetton and Compiani acknowledge financial support from Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative.**

i.e this whole ""paper"" is nothing but a hit piece propaganda sponsored by a competitor

The other writer of this paper is Adiar Morse, who conveniently works for the Dept of Treasury under Yellen: 

https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/prof-adair-morse-joins-biden-administration-as-a-treasury-department-deputy/

Seems like natural career progression - collect funds from Ripple to publish propaganda against Bitcoin, and get hired by Yellen who has been promoting propaganda against crypto for years now. Nothing to see here.

Final Edit: Jjust look at the number of freshly created ""Tin"" accounts that have popped up in the comments to shill for XRP. Didnt realize 2017 left so many bag holders. It must be real miserable with these heavy bags that are at 1/3rd of their 2017 ATH, while almost every other coin has gone up hundreds of % and made new highs this cycle. Thats what happens when you become exit liquidity for mccaleb, garlinghouse etc. 

Lol at the shills shouting ""REEE ripple is a company XRP is decentralised token"". They really did you good with this one small trick. 
Thats also the reason garlinhouse drives a shiny car while you are down 50% on your shitcoin investment. 

The D in XRP stands for decentralised. It was always a premined scam token and will always be one. Thousands of tin bagholders wont change this.",3887,2022-01-15 22:15:00,2655

XRP,cryptocurrency,Charles from cardano was right. You need ripple to win or this lawsuit. The SEC is going to open up CoinMarketCap and start litigating down the list. Do not let tribalism get in the way of this.,"By winning the suit against ripple and the execs (for anyone who’s been following the suit ripple are absolutely smashing it) there will be case precedent. 

They will have the big fish and case law.

This means any ico or sale of crypto from the inventors of said crypto will be targeted. There’s one thing the SEC likes and that is money. 

They can see an untapped wealth of fines and settlements here and they want to be the regulator who controls crypto in the USA. You might hate Xrp, but right now ripple and their lawyers are preventing the SEC from getting their hands on the crypto market.

I have been following this case very very closely, the BtC Is The BesT tHe ResT aRe ShiTcOinS mentality is fcking stupid. If you cannot see what the SEC is trying to do here then good luck.

XRP,cryptocurrency,XRP got much more love than they deserve - Ripple is heavily centralized and fights real decentralization in the crypto space,"During the SEC lawsuit, I have noticed XRP getting a lot of love from the crypto community, and I can understand this. The SEC was never only going against Ripple as we have seen this year, so this entire lawsuit was somehow representative for all of crypto.

However now that things are somehow settled, we should face reality: XRP is just another heavily centralized project, no matter if it's a security or not. The consensus mechanism is literally proof of trust - The network runs on a bunch of bank owned servers, relying on all participants being doxxed. This is not innovative blockchain tech, this is the same old banking system using ""blockchain"" as a marketing term.

I could live with that alone or ignore it at least - XRP it's by far not the only centralized cryptocurrency. However Ripple has also done their best in the past to fight real decentralized cryptos like BTC and ETH:

They often attack BTC, for example Ripple CFO claimed BTC is controlled by China in 2020 ([source](https://gizmodo.com/ripple-claims-bitcoin-is-chinese-controlled-while-annou-1845932148)). The same claims were made against Ethereum according to Vitalik Buterin ([source](https://zycrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-faults-ripples-decentralization-claim-says-the-platform-is-completely-centralized/)), for which they never apologized.

Also most of you probably remember they funded a FUD energy campaign that tried to push Bitcoin towards PoS ([source](https://decrypt.co/96298/ripple-co-founder-backs-controversial-campaign-change-bitcoin-code)).

&#x200B;

At this point people should really think twice if that's a project they want to support just because there is some bullish outlook after they won the case. Ripple is not using, but abusing ""blockchain"" - and they are certainly not your friends.",535,2023-08-01 12:13:25,502

It turns out that Ripple Labs is essentially the central bank of this system. And XRP is its CBDC.

XRP,cryptocurrency,The SEC’s Window to File an Appeal in the Ripple Case has Officially Closed For Years,"I think everyone here saw the news that the SEC was planning to appeal the summary judgement ruling handed down from Judge Torres on Friday. The whole thing started when the SEC filed documents in the Do Kwon case that read as below:

“The SEC respectfully avers that Ripple conflicts with and adds baseless requirements to Howey and it’s progeny. Respectfully, those portions of Ripple were wrongfully decided, and the court should not follow them.”

I mean what else are they gonna say? Of course they disagree with the ruling. But, as many pro-crypto lawyers have pointed out, if the SEC loses an appeal then it becomes binding case law for trial judges. This would be disastrous for their plans to bring the crypto market into “compliance”. 

Anyhow, The SEC had until midnight to file an interlocutory appeal. An interlocutory appeal is basically an appeal before final judgment on some aspects of the ruling. They’re rarely filed and even more rarely accepted.

They didn’t file one, which means they must wait until final judgment from the jury trial to file an appeal unless there is a settlement. Ripple’s CEO has said that the trial could take years. 

TL;DR

The SEC’s window to file an interlocutory appeal in the Ripple case has ended. They must now wait until the jury trial is finished to file an appeal which could take years according to Ripple’s CEO.

XRP,cryptocurrency,"The SEC is going after Coinbase now. First it was Ripple and all of us laughed. Now it is Coinbase, Next it could be us.","The SEC is suing Coinbase over its Lend product that pays out interest to asset holders. This is appalling, because it is something that the banks that the SEC protects will never be able to do - give actual returns to user’s assets, not the 0.05% interest pittance that is dished out to users by banks. 

Somehow, the big brains at SEC, well funded by tax payers, have now come up with legal arguments as to why giving retail end users a decent interest rate is a crime and securities fraud. 🤯

The regulators never act in the interest of retail users, mom and pop investors and regular folk. They simply exist to protect the rights of the banking and securities cartel. There never was any investigation into dark pools, naked shorts by hedge funds, trading restrictions and manipulation by the big players. Instead, the SEC even made rules that now prevent retail from buying shares in companies they own. Basically legitimising Robinhood’s tactics. 

Even right now, there are more GME shares held by institutions than the total shares outstanding. So many counterfeit shares. Over the last week, shares of defunct companies like Blockbuster and Sears have surged 1000%... these are companies that are already bankrupt and in liquidation, but somehow a well regulated SEC monitored market still allows Blockbuster to rise 1500%.

The SEC is utterly incompetent and exists only to harass retail and prevent small time investors from making it big

Coinbase CEO Brain Armstrong put out a message just now :

 “Some really sketchy behavior coming out of the SEC recently.
Story time…Millions of crypto holders have been earning yield on their assets over the last few years. It makes sense, if you want to lend out your funds, you can earn a return. Everyone seems happy.
A bunch of great companies in crypto have been offering versions of this for years. Coinbase came out recently and said we would be launching our own version....

They responded by telling us this lend feature is a security. Ok - seems strange, how can lending be a security? So we ask the SEC to help us understand and share their view. We always make an effort to work proactively with regulators, and keep an open mind.”

Tl DR: the SEC refused to meet either Coinbase, saying they don’t meet crypto companies. But prefer regulation by litigation approach. 

These are not the actions of an regulatory agent acting in good faith.",576,2021-09-08 04:02:05,233

XRP,cryptocurrency,Update in the SEC vs ripple labs case. The SEC is refusing to hand over documents in regards to their internal trading policies. Even after being ordered by the judge….twice.,"What you are seeing here is elite corruption at its highest level. The SEC is refusing to hand over internal trading policies in regards to staff and their holdings of securities.

Basically the SEC allowed staff to own Xrp up until 2018/2019. They emailed 3rd party investors (you and me) in late 2020 and stated they had not made a determination on Xrp’s security status.

Yet they are suing ripple, Brad and Chris for breaking securities laws from……2013. There is a hearing coming up in regards to these documents…..again. 

The SEC is nothing but a gangster organisation who litigate for fines which is their source of revenue. The Ripple lawsuit has given the public a look behind closed doors to see how utterly corrupt they are.

XRP,cryptocurrency,"Ripple’s XRP soars 30% - why you should be supporting Ripple, regardless of your opinion on XRP","I’m sure most of you here have seen XRP’s staggering performance today. The reason for this post is because most people on this sub dislike XRP due to its centralised nature. However, the following reason - in my opinion - is why everyone should be cheering for Ripple in the ongoing lawsuit, no matter your opinion on XRP.

Let’s face it, XRP holders have had a rough few years after the lawsuit was announced in December 2020. However, as the years have gone on, we have seen countless amazing projects enter and drop out of the top 10 - Chainlink, Monero, Tezos - to name a few. Guess which coin has amazingly retained its top 10 spot, despite having the SEC on its back? You guessed it: XRP.

Regardless of whether you hold, love or hate XRP, Ripple are doing what pretty much all of us would love to do, and that’s give a huge middle finger to the SEC. One must realise that an SEC victory will put so many other projects under scrutiny, and this will not favour crypto well as a whole. We will witness many of our favourite projects being placed under the microscope of the regulators. However, if the lawsuit ends with a Ripple victory, it may potentially set up crypto for a (mini) bull run, as regulators are forced to lay off as we see some sort of regulatory clarity in our beloved industry. The crypto industry as a whole is likely to piggy-back off the success of the lawsuit, should we see a favourable victory. No one wants to be in Ripple’s position, but I’m sure we can all appreciate that Ripple has taken one for the team and is fighting one of the most important battles - not just for themselves, but for the entire crypto industry.

XRP,cryptocurrency,Why Ripple's XRP is poised for $10,"I will present the case why XRP will re-enter price discovery this year due to the very bullish chart structure. I believe that XRP is imitating Bitcoin's previous cycle from 2018-2021. Of course, this is not financial advice, you must proceed at your own caution and exercise appropriate risk management but I wanted to share my thoughts.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rsiesesy7vsc1.png?width=1593&format=png&auto=webp&s=918f22ab28ac6db98f6a9d4705e8e5e42c59de47

The image is the Bitcoin price chart during the last cycle. We see Bitcoin crash to 3k in 2018, followed by a retrace to the 0.618 retracement to 14k in 2019, then re-accumulation back down to the lows in early 2020 followed by price expansion, almost reaching a full 4.236 extension in 2021.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wju0aun18vsc1.png?width=1581&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b50d93e9f28ef43bb1520d239cc399650e0b18

This image is the XRP price chart. XRP is showing a similar structure to Bitcoin's previous cycle but just behaving much more slowly which is why most people think the project is dead, retail investors don't have much patience. We observe that XRP crashed to $0.11 in 2020, then retraced to around the 0.618 at $2 in 2021, followed by re-accumulation in 2022-23 and now I believe we are about to enter the price expansion phase. If XRP was achieve a full 4.236 extension like bitcoin, then the target would be above $10.

Both the structure of bitcoin and XRP show: crash, retrace, re-accumulation and now price expansion.

However, I would like to offer some balance as well and want to re-iterate that XRP must break the 2021 high of $2 to show confirmation of an uptrend. Otherwise, it may make another lower high and that would cause XRP to deviate away from what BTC did last cycle. This bullish thesis hinges on XRP being able to break that 2021 high, so pay close attention to that.

I also believe that 2024 will be make or break for XRP. As I expect the inevitable hard landing of the US economy in the second half of this year. It's pretty much now or never for coins like XRP. If it is unable to do anything meaningful this year, I will have to conclude the project is dead because once the macro conditions turns ugly, there is no chance for any crypto to do well in that environment. The stock market is the force that drives crypto bull runs. However, I remain hopeful that we get our XRP bull run this year.

Most people on this subreddit hate XRP which is again another reason to be bullish. The herd of retail investors is generally wrong. They all expected 100k in 2021, they all thought crypto died in 2022, they all expected 12k in 2023, they hated Solana at the lows...the list is endless. When has the herd of retail investors ever been right about anything? Now they all expect the bull run to last until late 2025 lmao.

I am a firm believer of ""show me the chart and I will tell you the news"", so I am expecting some bullish narrative to emerge for XRP, who knows. Regardless, I think we can all agree that 2024 will be pivotal for coins like XRP. Look forward to hearing your thoughts!

XRP,cryptocurrency,"XRP news abound this week! Former Ripple chair Barr Confirmed as new Fed Chief, Judge Netburn named the SEC 'hypocrites' in ruling, McCaleb (XLM) dumping nearly done. Whew!","My goodness friends, what a week for Ripple. XRP holders, catalysts abound yet we remain stuck in by the bears. Let's do a quick recap anyway, and hope that the market begins to reflect the bullish news:

Michael Barr Confirmed: Michael Barr, a former Ripple adviser, is set to assume one of the most important U.S. regulatory roles after winning Senate confirmation to be vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve. Barr is considered an ally to crypto, but has tempered his sentiments with expectations that the market be regulated robustly. This appointment is widely considered good for crypto, and considering it's issues with the SEC - good for Ripple.

Netburn says 'the Hinman emails must be produced': The long awaited ruling has finally come down from Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn regarding the attorney-client privilege of conversations had with SEC lawyers by William Hinman. Judge Netburn unequivocally ruled in favor of Ripple, even slamming the 'hypocrisy' of the SEC in its attempted defense - asserting that the SEC isn't even attempting to follow the law in good faith. In his now infamous speech Hinman said that Bitcoin and Ethereum were not to be considered securities, despite ETH having conducted the same kind of unregistered token offerings as Ripple. The preperatory emails Hinman exchanged with SEC lawyers have been desperately guarded to this point, and it remains to be seen what the SEC will do. It seems likely that there will be a series of appeals to Judge Analise Torres, who is responsible for ruling on any appeals to Judge Netburn's decisions.

Jed's dead baby: Former Ripple CTO Jed McCaleb is almost done selling his 9 billion XRP after nearly 8 years. Jed left Ripple after having differences with the leadership team on the direction of the project there. Jed has since worked to bring Stellar (XLM) into the crypto space as a competitor to Ripple within the global payment settlement industry. It is believed that Jed has nearly completed selling his stack of XRP, (he holds approximately 10 million in his TacoStand account) which is estimated to be gone by weeks end. XRP fans are ecstatic about this, as the downward selling pressure has been significant from McCaleb for nearly a decade.

Other notes: Did you know that Ripple only controls about 5% of nodes on the XRPL? XRP is more decentralized than many crypto projects. The community drives most innovations on chain as well, and will soon deliver Smart Contracts to XRPL in a 100% community driven effort, minus any Ripple devs. Congrats!

Much to be excited for if you hold a bag of XRP. Thanks for reading!",312,2022-07-14 12:37:42,223

XRP,cryptocurrency,Ripple lawyer accuses SEC of intentional delay lawsuit,"One of the top lawyers in the Ripple (XRP) camp, Stuart Alderoty, recently lashed out at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Twitter. According to Alderoty, the SEC would deliberately try to delay the lawsuit between themselves and Ripple as long as possible.

&#x200B;

**Ripple lawsuit**

Ripple, meanwhile, has been embroiled in an infamous lawsuit with the US SEC for over a year. The SEC accuses Ripple of selling securities in the past without the necessary licenses. At the moment, Ripple is hopeful that the lawsuit will soon come to an end and the judge will finally issue a ruling. However, Alderoty lashed out at the SEC on Twitter. He believes that the SEC does not want the court case to end any time soon.

**Gary Gensler**

In the series of Twitter messages, Alderoty responds to a message from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Gensler revealed why, in his opinion, enforcement of rules is one of the SEC's most important tasks. Soccer without referees would turn into an unfair occupation in no time according to Gensler. If teams don't have to worry about penalties and enforcement of the rules, things will go wrong. The same goes for the markets, according to Gensler.

Alderoty argues that the SEC is guilty of ""regulation by enforcement."" That by simply initiating a lawsuit against an entity they are trying to control certain markets. This is also why, according to Alderoty, the SEC does not seem to be in any particular hurry in the lawsuit.

XRP,cryptocurrency,"My efforts for mass adoption: I'm building a crypto to fiat point of sale app and payment platform. Supporting Nano, Stellar Lumens and Ripple payments to USD and AUD (initially). Your feedback is greatly appreciated.","I very much believe that cryptocurrencies will be adopted by the masses in the future however I also believe that a series of gradual transitions need to occur rather than a mass takeover. The majority of merchants are simply not ready or willing to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. There are several reasons for this including obvious volatility issues, difficulty in liquidating crypto assets, ongoing changes to regulation, taxation issues and the general negative or uninformed perception of cryptocurrencies.


In an ideal world we as consumers should be able to choose which currencies we trade with, while merchants should be able to receive the currencies that work for their businesses. The platform I’m building caters for currency agnostic transactions for point of sale using mobile apps (web based crypto-fiat payments will follow soon after). I believe this interim approach leads to several benefits:


*	Consumers can spend their crypto immediately without having to convert to fiat first. There are potential tax implications here.

*	Merchants don’t need to worry about volatility, however they can still accept cryptocurrencies for the benefit of their customers.

*	There are no fees to be paid by merchants for payment processing.

*	Rewards (Liquidium Tokens) will be given to both merchants and consumers for using the services. This will incentivize both parties to spend crypto as spending leads to the earning of tokens.

*	Anybody with a bank account can be a merchant. This is to be used by individuals and businesses to facilitate crypto to fiat payments.

So far the platform can accept Nano, Ripple, Stellar Lumens and soon, Liquidium (LQM). Liquidium is a token based on the Stellar network. These tokens will be used for transactions and rewards and since it’s based on Stellar, all transactions are quick to settle.


I understand there are many projects focusing on crypto payments but it seems like most projects that started as ICOs are focusing on pushing their own token / coin rather than enabling crypto payments for all cryptocurrencies suitable for cheap and timely transactions.


To prove I’m not full of shit, [here is a brief demo of the app](https://youtu.be/Ft6ku1s8sTg) actually working (functionality and design subject to change between now and the release). We currently have a few businesses testing the system in the real world. Open beta testing invites will take place soon.

Any input is much appreciated. This will be released soon and I'd like to appeal to as wide an audience as possible.

I have set up a subreddit [/r/liquidium](https://np.reddit.com/r/liquidium) if you’d like to keep track of the project or ask questions. We’ll be looking for early adopters in the near future.

This explains why the SEC have been unable to simply threaten them and get them to settle for an undisclosed amount.

So far this looks good for crypto because it shows us that the space won't simply vanish because of a few powerful people wanting to control or to get rid of it. Gary Gensler has gone unhinged and attacked many other crypto companies as well, this looks a lot like frustration.

XRP,cryptocurrency,"ETH is bad, and I am tired of pretending it's not.","I am going to open up by saying that some of the following is going to be FACT and some of it will be OPINION. However, the opinion will never prevail over the facts. Also, depending on traction I may do a second post with some more up to debate things.  
I also know that the title alone will lead to downvotes, some of you won’t even read it before downvoting. It is a shame that people forgot downvotes are supposed to be used to penalize off-topic and not to punish unpopular opinions, not to create echo chambers.    
So let’s get to it shall we?   

**ETH is shady:**  
Not only is ETH a security, it has always been manipulated by well connected and powerful people behind the scenes. The connections between the ETH Foundation, ConsenSys, and the SEC are totally public knowledge. 
Jay Clayton, the former SEC chairman, was a partner at Sullivan and Cromwell.    
Joe Lubin, co-founder of ETH, also founded ConsenSys. He also bought 9.5% of ETH supply.   
ConsenSys is a client of Sullivan and Cromwell.  
That was the back door ETH used to get the free pass on regulations.  
There are court papers about the meetings between ConsenSys and the SEC.  
At the same time, the SEC was prosecuting DOZENS of ICOs that were using the exact same approach ETH was.  
Hinman’s, Clayton’s Director of Corporate Finance, speech where he says ETH is not a security was partly WRITTEN by some of ETH top investors.  
The plan by ConsenSys with the help of the SEC was clearly to make ETH the only crossborders payment platform by giving it a free pass, while at the same time preventing any incursion into that space with SEC lawsuits.   
At the same time this was happening, Gary Gensler told an MIT audience that “XRP deserved regulatory clarity”.  (I won’t go in depth with the Ripple lawsuit here).  
Not only is Chairman Gensler trying to pretend he never said that, and the entire SEC trying to hide the fact they gave ETH a free pass, to date ETH is the only altcoin to have had the privilege of being formally consider a commodity/currency and not a security.   
Other funny “coincidences” include: Claydon being hired by a crypto hedge fund 100% invested in BTC and ETH. SEC Enforcement Director Marc Berger being hired by Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett, part of the ETH Alliance and Hinman’s prior employer, less than a month after the Ripple lawsuit was filled. Hinman receiving $15 Million, during his service on the SEC, from  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett. AND after leaving the SEC, Hinman returned to  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett as a senior crypto adviser.  

**ETH is centralized:**  
Users and nodes have no real power to shape the protocol. This is virtually true of all protocols with a Foundation at it’s head, but we can’t forget ETH falls under this group.  
The first piece of evidence here is the ETC hard fork. This fork happened because the wrong people lost money. The changed the code and the protocol for the first time to suit the wealthy whales and not the users or miners. They changed the rules to fit their goals.    
The second piece comes in the form of changes to mining rewards. This was a blatant attempt to decrease supply by not paying the miners. More important than the way it impacts the economics of ETH, it points towards a centralisation of power. Rules can be changed on the fly with no consideration from the community but based on profits alone for the higher ups.  
This leads us to the PoS change. This has nothing to do with energy concerns or with price of fees. This is meant to skip all the intermediate problems by getting rid of miners and let the token holders leverage their will directly. Don’t forget the LUDICROUS amount of ETH that was pre-mined.  
Every hard fork the Ethereum blockchain has enacted has always been for the benefit of the few, never for the benefits of the community. You know what that looks like? Our current banking system. Where the citizens and the working class pay the price for mistakes and reap none of the rewards for profit.  
People in this sub hate central bank digital currencies, failing to see that every abuse these could enact on the public, so can Ethereum upon it’s users.    
To quote one of my sources “Etherium is not a decentralized peer-to-peer system. It is a system with an unaccountable ruling class exploiting the working class, making promises they can’t keep, while spinning a wonderful narrative.”  
  
**ETH recent and future design is bad:**  
Everyone was fooled into thinking EIP 1559 was going to be a good thing. How the Foundation pulled that off is honestly mind boggling.  
This change made it so fees were more uniform. Uniformly high. And making sure that miners saw none of that profit by burning it.   
Burning the fees essentially made sure that the biggest holders get they profits increased because every ETH is worth more, while miners that actually keep the network safe get a pay cut because there are less fees per block for them.  
But the biggest problem is that you are getting a landlorded network to users. If you want ETH to be useful, you need to, well, use it. But this model makes it so the interests of holders are opposite to the interests of users. Users want lower fees so they can use the network to transact, but holders want higher fees, for more burn and more profit.  
Taking money out of the pockets of miners decreases security. If you are paid less you have a higher incentive to get your money some other ways.   
And since users and holders have different agendas, future goals benefit different people. An interesting question would be for instance what happens in the case of a block size adjustment? Bigger or smaller block sized benefit users and holders differently.
Well, given ETH’s history, you know how those chips would fall. Even this decision was reached by a small amount of key players.  
And PoS will only make this whole process more straight forward. The fact that the token holding are already so centralized will make changes easier for the ruling class and be baked into the system.    

**In conclusion:**    
ETH’s had a shady start, has been controlled by a group of shadow players on the background, is becoming less and less secure and has no intention of not being.    
At any point, any decision can be hard forked in. The miners don’t matter. Your nodes don’t matter.  
ETH is INTENDED to shackle you the exact same way the current banking system does.    
Don’t be fooled.

And damn market really took notice. XRP just had a 20 percent green candle in a matter of few minutes. Actually most of crypto has gone up suddenly few percent in top 100 after the news of this has arrived which is pretty bullish for cryptos in general.

So congrats to all the XRP holders, and unfortunately even though I'm not the one I'm glad for XRP success because success in this ruling might mean a huge win for all the cryptos overall... All of the cryptos in top 100 have took a huge notice since this ruling has been publicly declared, so good to see.",3481,2023-07-13 15:41:20,1055

XRP,cryptocurrency,"Ripple will deploy 200 million new XRP on the market this month; a dive into XRPs supply inflation | Every month, 1 billion XRPs become available for Ripple spending and can impact the market","*\*this report was* [*originally posted*](https://portaldobitcoin.uol.com.br/como-funciona-o-processo-que-vai-colocar-novos-r-460-milhoes-em-xrp-no-mercado-este-mes/) *on* ***Portal do Bitcoin*** *(in Portuguese-BR).*

Ripple, the company responsible for the XRP cryptocurrency, unlocked one billion units in July and, of that total, kept 200 million for itself. The amount can be put into circulation at any time and this inflationary process is repeated every month, which may impact the price and investments in the asset.

These XRPs held by Ripple in July amounts to around $94 million, at the time of writing, and the company has absolute freedom to use (or sell) these crypto assets as it sees fit.

In the case of selling, the amount represents more than 10% of the average daily trading volume of XRP on the market, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/) — which could impact its price.

Analysing [Binance’s order book](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/XRP_USDT?theme=dark&type=spot), responsible for the highest liquidity of XRP in the market, 200 million would be enough to completely clear all buy orders on all available spot pairs this Sunday (9).

This event, which can create strong selling pressure, is repeated every month and will continue like this for at least the next four years.

I’ve delved into XRP’s supply inflation system to understand and explain how these monthly releases works.

## How XRP supply inflation works

When XRP was created in 2012, the currency's ledger programmed a maximum of 100 billion units. Of which 20 billion was initially distributed between its creators and the core team behind the project.

80 billion came under the control of Ripple's treasury, which promised not to use the entire available supply at once, but to spend these coins gradually. In 2017, the team decided to [implement](https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-escrows-55-billion-xrp-for-supply-predictability/) a new system, aiming to provide more predictability in increasing the circulating supply (which moves from the Treasury Accounts to the market).

The [escrow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escrow.asp) system was implemented. It is a type of [smart contract](https://ripple.com/insights/explanation-ripples-xrp-escrow/) that locks XRPs, making their use impossible, to be unlocked under some previously programmed conditions.

Ripple’s condition was to unlock one billion XRP on the first day of each month of each subsequent month, for a total of 55 months — or 55 billion XRP that still remained to be put into circulation.

However, even with a monthly release of a billion, not all of it was spent or sold by the company. In this way, Ripple began to lock in the remaining amount monthly, in new escrow contracts for the future. Extending the 55-month deadline for all XRPs to be released.

According to Messari, the XRP circulating supply has already increased by 8% in the last 12 months. Resulting in an approximate annual inflation in this value. There are currently 52.25 billion XRP circulating in the market.

## Where are the 1 billion XRP unlocked in July?

Following the onchain trails of Ripple's latest escrow release, I’ve found that out of the total 1 billion XRP, 800 million were rescheduled to be unlocked within \~3,5 years.

100 million adds to the previous 900 million for release on December 1, 2026; while 700 million started a new escrow that will only be unlocked on the first day of 2027.

Still, Ripple kept 200 million liquid XRP for this month.

https://preview.redd.it/habpwgudqxab1.png?width=2008&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f794b5ce21eb214bdab0fbcc14f5180f09d7b9c

In the cash flow graph, one billion XRP were unlocked (by escrow) on July 1, 2023. Split into five transactions, destined for two wallet addresses controlled by Ripple: [Ripple (22)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rp6aTJmW3nq1aKt3Jmuz4DPRxksT5PBjpH) and [Ripple (23)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rsjFB8mPWqiZgPUaVh8XYqdfa59PE2d5LG).

Each address received 500 million XRP. The Ripple (23) address forwarded everything to another address controlled by the company, [Ripple (10)](https://xrpscan.com/account/r9UUEXn3cx2seufBkDa8F86usfjWM6HiYp), which total value was fully locked in the new escrow for January 1, 2027.

The 500 million XRP received by Ripple (22) were split into two new transactions:

* 200 million sent to [Ripple (1)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rBg2FuZT91C52Nny68houguJ4vt5x1o91m), which remain liquid and available for use by Ripple;
* 300 million sent to [Ripple (11)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rB3WNZc45gxzW31zxfXdkx8HusAhoqscPn), which was again split and locked into two different escrows. One expiring on December 1, 2026 (100 million XRP); and another on January 1, 2027 (200 million XRP).

It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
15. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
17. **Bitcoin SV (BSV)\*:** Bitcoin Scam Variant
18. **EOS (EOS):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
19. **Elrond (EGLD):** Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR)\*:** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
37. **SushiSwap (SUSHI):** a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
38. **Binance USD (BUSD):** Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.
39. **FTX Token (FTT):** It’s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.
40. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the token of Crypto.com public blockchain, that tries to enable transaction worldwide between people and businesses.
41. **Filecoin (FIL):** a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services.
42. **UMA (UMA):** it builds open-source infrastructure in order to create synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain
43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",14818,2021-02-09 12:03:25,1588

XRP,cryptocurrency,I'm been in crypto since 2013. Maybe 700+ alt coins and many trades. Now a Defi-Crypto Farmer. Here are some of my tips and advice for new-comers.,"As the title says I'm into crypto pretty deep.  I was in crypto briefly in 2013, but only really hit the ground running in 2017 and never looked back.  In 2017 I made all the usual mistakes, got into the wrong coins, entered some dodgy exchanges and sold the wrong coins (like selling Enjin on its first day after investing in the ICO).  In 2018 things got worse, with shitcoins driving the BTC value of my holdings down by half.

Now I'm sitting really pretty and feel like I have ""clicked"" to the point where I am generally making money in crypto and quite a few people ask me for advice on what to do, strategies etc.  Here are some of my tips, observations and ideas.

1. Don't trust anyone.  Assume everybody you are talking to is a friendly thief who wants your money.  That includes people shilling particular coins, or anyone asking for your crypto to invest, to random people that message you.  (And yes ironically this means don't trust me, but you'll see I didn't mention my altcoin holdings and I am deliberately staying quiet on what my 800% defi pool is  :) )
2. Every position you enter should be a fixed percentage of your portfolio.  I prefer 1% for a typical trade.  Risky uniswap gems might be 0.5%, very strong longer term positions say 2-5%.
3. Have your portfolio value in BTC (or ETH if you prefer that).  Your goal is to increase your BTC value.  Each trade should be from BTC, and then exit back out of BTC.  Log all transactions in blockfolio etc under the BTC pair, so you can see how much BTC value you are gaining.  Don't worry as much about USD gains, as in a bull market its easy to make USD value gains.  BTC is the end-game here so you want to accumulate BTC, especially if BTC dominance is falling.
4. Have a portion of your portfolio allocated to farming or staking.  If you have a coin sitting somewhere for ages, ask if there is some way for you to make money from it.  For example, I have a large stack of BTC and ETH, so rather than have it sitting doing nothing, I wrapped the BTC and entered a Sushi Farm.  Months later the rewards from that farm are worth something like 25% of the amount I initially invested.  Every so often, harvest the rewards and either re-farm (compounding) or shift to your long term hold.  Remember compound interest.  There are opportunities for very high returns (without ponzi aspects but be careful) - find those, constantly take and re-invest the income and the gains are quite extreme.
5. Have a dedicated stack of BTC or ETH that is your ""HODL"" portfolio that you never touch.  Preferably in seperate legal entity (like a trust) than what you trade with.  This will help for taxes.  Every so often, move some profits into that long term stack.   I don't do anything with that stack at all, it is just my safe holdings.
6. Spend as much time learning about tax as you do trading.  Tax is something you kind of need to understand upfront - you can get way more rekt from bad tax approaches than you make gains with good trading.  And keep your records safe - download all trade histories at the end of every quarter.
7. Use telegram (or discord).  Find really helpful smart and useful people and stick to them.  Find helpful trading groups.  Eventually they will be a vital source of information or just ways to bounce ideas off.  Check out my previous post for a full guide on ""must have"" telegram groups.
8. Read the crypto news as much as you can.  Its amazing how often something pops up (e.g. grayscale announcing new trusts with other coins) and there is still a decent amount of time to buy.  And always have some BTC on an exchange ready to buy on such an opportunity.  Again, telegram is great for this as you can quickly see tweets or news-links being shared.
9. Have a preset % of gain or losses whereby you will sell if it reaches that.  For example, for most coins, if a coin ever goes up more than 30% vs BTC in a day I always sell.  95% of the time that works out as better than holding.  In the rare event I double my position I always sell the principal immediately (I did this twice this year - with Ethernity and Blind Boxes).
10. Always have an idea as to what the current ""climate"" is in terms of what is moving and in favour.  Crypto markets often move with certain sectors at a time.  For example, if you look at the Coin Gecko categories list, you can immediately spot what is ""hot"" right now.  Last month it was NFTs, so I was heavy in that space, but now that sector is cooling.  The binance smart chain and exchange coins are doing very well right now - if that is the case what else might move?  Well other low gas blockchains could be an idea - especially if they have defi - so Avax, Raydium etc are all moving too.  Soon it might well be BTC's time to gain as the expense of alts.  You should be rotating in and out of positions to try and go with the ebb and flow of the market.
11. For newcomers, start with basic stuff like accumulating bitcoin, learning to use a wallet, security etc.  Don't just dive in and ape into defi coins, wsb style.  It may suck that it feels like you are missing all the gains from the ""hot"" new coins, but it will equally hurt if you are just burning through your capital.
12. Look out for free crypto opportunities.  They key here is sorting out the gems from the scams.  This isn't just staking etc but also things like reddit moons and airdrops.  A lot of people are even ""airdrop farming"" whereby you have wallets that carry out certain activities deliberately to try and qualify for future airdrops.  Coin market cap earn and coinbase earn are two more.  Even something like the binance ""dust"" feature to turn dust into bnb is a way of generating some more bnb (even if its tiny).  Check out my previous post on free crypto and ways to get passive income
13. For farming, make sure you are using the right apps like zapper or apy vision to track all your positions, your yield and any impermanent loss.  That will also help with tax records down the track, should you need it.  Watch out for farming on the ETH network as your gas fees will chew up any gains if you have small positions.  Check out my previous post of sushi farming for how the rewards and gains work
14. Track all your numbers, your gains, your investments and portfolio change religiously, preferably in an excel document.  That way you'll know how you are performing and if something is going wrong.  Again, I wish I had done this more in 2018.
15. Have an ""emergency reserve"".  For me, this is actually my stock positions, many which are crypto related, but you could have gold or cash (I especially like the idea of something like stable coins lent on FTX at a decent interest rate).  If we get some kind of crypto turbo dump which is 40%, you can then have that as money on the side-lines ready to buy.
16. Constantly educate yourself.  For me, I still need 3-4 hours a day to research and learn about crypto.  I find crypto podcasts and even youtube vital sources of information, provided you are listening to the right people.  Mix up your education with news, technical strategies, trading updates, altcoin news and even just the general philosophy behind sound money and financial sovereignty.
17. If you win or lose on a trade, delete that coin from blockfolio immediately.  Why?  Because you have exited that position, and seeing it jump up again in price is just going to torment you.  You've made the decision to sell, don't even up revenge trading where you come back and try and get your losses back on the same trade.
18. Never margin trade UNLESS it is only because you want to minimise your funds at risk on an exchange.  Even then I'd avoid it.  Unfortunately many exchanges make this very hard to use - and there are confusing terms and default options which can rekt you (for example, positions that will drain your other funds instead of liquidiating the trade if falls too much).  In fact, I avoid almost all USD pairings and only trade BTC pairing, unless very special circumstances are in play (such as ripple being delisted from coinbase).
19. Never hold more than around 10 coins.  I used to have up to 40 at a time, it became impossible tracking them in terms of activity, prices, and god the horrors of trying to maintain enough wallets for them.  10 is enough diversification.  I used to have a ""bag"" of around 15 moonshots - that strategy never worked as even if one ""Gem"" actually made it big, the losses from the other ones cancelled out.  Typically if I had a huge gain from one of my coins, I sell back to BTC and waits for other opportunities.  This isn't Pokemon - don't try and ""catch them all"".
20. Falling in love with alt-coins is like falling in love at a stripclub.  Yes trade them.  But just be conscious that their chances of beating BTC long term are very unlikely.  Just look at all my 2013 gems (peer coin, feather coin etc).  Heck I bought World-Coin because I read about a ""bitcoin genius teenager"" who made millions from crypto and said World-Coin was the next bitcoin.  And I've made my mistakes as well going forward, holding on for dear life for nano (yes I know its fast and instant!) and grin.  I think the tech for both coins is great, that doesn't mean its a great trade.  If you want to marry your alt-coins then you will be lucky if you only lose half your money like a real world divorce :)
21. EDIT. Bonus one.  Always learn from your losses (and I have MANY).  I like to think of crypto as like a computer game where you are gaining new skills.  Think of RPG games like Baldur's Gate or Warcraft.  You can earn money or experience, and use that to gain new items or skills that protect you against certain things.  So maybe you lost $500 to a ""rug-pull""?  Well do your research and figure out how to avoid that next time.  Maybe you'll spend the next 2 weeks mad about it, but next time a potential rug-pull project comes along you'll dodge it - congratulations you now have learned ""immunity to rug-pulls"".   Keep learning and gaining more experience and you'll start avoiding all the traps.
22. EDIT 2:  You are going to have MANY scenarios where you see a coin that has gone x1000 or to some ridiculous crescendo, where you feel utterly compelled to buy to avoid missing out.  This is the obvious trap (if you want an example of this look at Safemoon right now.  Bitconnect was the one in 2017 and there are others).  At some point bitcoin or ethereum will do a similar run up, and many people outside crypto will do the same thing.  Yes this can be irresistible but you must resist the temptation - think of the cryptos has being a bunch of boats on the wharf, and there are thousands of boats.  Every day another hundred turn up.  Why are you going to try and jump across the water to get to the boat that is already leaving, when if you wait a bit another few dozen will turn up in five minutes?  You'll just fall in the water and miss out on those new boats!
23. If you must trade as a new-comer, I highly suggest trading the smaller / middle cap BTC pairs.  Not the USD or margin pairs.  Certainly not something like futures contracts on FTX.  Why?  Because if you are on bitmex / bybit / ftx etc you are swimming with the whales and sharks, quant funds, robo-traders and the like.  If you entered the casino for the first time in your life, would you immediately go to the blackjack table with James Bond and Dr Evil?  The smaller BTC pairs are more likely to have less experienced traders - my trades actually went positive once I moved from USD pairs on margin exchanges to spot BTC trades with altcoins.
24. Last edit before bed (I promise).  The chances are, crypto is still cyclical.  That means we will have another bear market, or at least a very long boring period of no gains.  If you have just joined crypto, you probably won't ""make it"" this cycle, as we may only have 6 months to a year to go.  I actually lost money (a lot) in BOTH the 2013 and 2017 bull markets (-50% and -85%, respectively).   All of my gains were made in the bear market when I was buying BTC and alts when BTC was in the 3ks.  The ""will you make it?"" test isn't coming now when the market seems to be going infinitely up and everybody is winning.  That test comes when everybody is selling and it seems like you are the only buyer.  And yeah, thousands of alt coins will suffer or die at that point.   So be around to scoop up the ashes - don't be the ashes!  This is all a larger part of learning to move with the cycles.

Anyway these are the ones that come to mind, hopefully that is helpful!  No doubt I'll edit this post and add a few more.",10417,2021-04-11 02:37:48,1309
XRP,cryptocurrency,XRP Jumps 9% As Investors Expect Favorable Conclusion To The Ongoing Sec Vs Ripple Case,,143,2022-09-18 07:39:01,146
XRP,cryptocurrency,Is this the end of SEC vs Ripple??,"I am not posting rockets…moons or any of that. Just curious as to thoughts about XRP recent gains. I am by no means saying it’s “pumping” and I am not sold that it will explode when the case is over. I am just curious as to thoughts about the case possibly coming to settlement and having gradual increase instead of the moonshot everyone feels will happen. I have been buying XRP and various other coins once Jan 2021. I believe in its utility (just look at the folks joining the team) I can’t help but think why on Earth would they have such a powerhouse of employees if it was a shit coin. It’s still in the top 10 even with the SEC lawsuit. I have bought from as low as .26 all the way to 1.35, and have bought other coins when XRP has risen above that. 

I realize there are folks that will say how it’s centralized and a shitcoin, but again, I believe in its utility and the projects Ripple is creating with them. Maybe instead of a moonshot we are a slow, gradual increase in price? 

Thoughts? Not just random thoughts either, but some substance with why you feel the way you do about the project please.",95,2022-03-22 04:41:13,210

What's more is that now you have Panama, Ukraine, Belarus and a few other countries looking into adopting crypto. A sovereign country making Bitcoin legal tender is huge for global adoption. No matter how small El Salvador is, it still holds the same weight in the UN as let's say the US in terms of voting power. 

Not only that, countries that rely heavily on remittances or have high inflation will be benefiting a lot from Bitcoin. In just 11 years of existence, Bitcoin has already become legal tender of a nation. It just proves that the cryptocurrency community has been right all along.",273,2021-09-10 23:38:05,145

It's basically another lawsuit accussing the SEC of having secret meeting withe some of the ETH staff to destroy their direct opponent Ripple. Something very often accused. But this lawsuit is diffrent to the other prior ones against the SEC from XRP.

XRP,cryptocurrency,Evergrande Economic Crisis: Unpacking the Ripple Effect on the Crypto space,"Well shit, here we go again eh?

I wanted to start a discussion about the ongoing Evergrande economic BS and its potential implications for the crypto space.

Evergrande, one of China's largest property developers, had been facing severe financial troubles, with concerns over its massive debt and potential default on its obligations. This situation has sparked fears of a potential domino effect that could impact not only the Chinese economy but also have ripple effects globally. And now, Evergrande have filed for bankruptcy protection in US

**""What does this have to do with cryptocurrency?""** Well, the interconnectedness of financial systems means that a crisis of this magnitude could lead to increased volatility and uncertainty across traditional markets, which could, in turn, have implications for the crypto space. 

Here are a few ways this could play out and impact cryptocurrencies:

**1. Safe Haven Narrative:** Historically, during times of economic uncertainty, investors have sought safe-haven assets like gold and, more recently, Bitcoin. If traditional markets experience turbulence due to the Evergrande crisis, we might see increased interest and investment in cryptocurrencies as a perceived hedge against economic instability.

**2. Increased Regulatory Scrutiny:** As traditional markets face challenges, governments and regulatory bodies might intensify their scrutiny of the cryptocurrency space, aiming to assert more control and oversight. This could lead to short-term negative sentiment and potential price volatility.

**3. Flight to Quality:** On the flip side, if investors begin losing confidence in risky assets like stocks and real estate, they might seek higher-quality investments. Cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals, real-world use cases, and robust technology could benefit from this shift in investment preferences.

**4. Liquidity Concerns:** The Evergrande crisis could potentially lead to liquidity issues in financial markets. In the cryptocurrency space, this might impact trading volumes and liquidity across various exchanges, potentially leading to short-term price fluctuations.

**5. Long-Term Adoption:** A prolonged crisis in traditional markets might prompt more individuals and institutions to explore alternative investment options, including cryptocurrencies. This increased interest could further accelerate the adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance.

Of course, it's important to remember that the relationship between traditional financial markets and cryptocurrencies is complex and multifaceted. While the Evergrande situation could certainly have some impact, the crypto market is influenced by a wide range of factors, both internal and external.

XRP,cryptocurrency,The Evergrande Crisis isn’t FUD; Get ready for big dips in the next week,"The Evergrande crash has so far caused a decline of 10-15% in the cryptocurrency market, and while many might buy the dip right now I’d suggest waiting for tomorrow’s even bigger crash

Why crypto (and other markets) will crash tomorrow -

1) The Chinese stock market will open after 2 days of holiday. Everyone is expecting a major crash here

2) Evergrande is expected to default on its loan payment, the same debt which Blackrock owns quite a big bag of, sending out a potential ripple effect

3) Sources out of Beijing say that the CCP are unlikely to bail Evergrande out (this point is just speculation)


So in conclusion, there are bigger dips coming.(I’m not suggesting to anyone to sell, just to be prepared for bigger dips)

Edit: When I wrote this, BTC was at $42k and ETH was at $3k, they’ve now dipped to 40K and 2.7K.

Edit 2: Seems like Evergrande is working on bond payments for Chinese banks and the CCP injected cash into the banking system.  We are safe for now, but unless Evergrande comes up with a payment plan for international institutions I’d say this isn’t completely over.

Edit 3: Crypto market is up, has been for a few hours now. Evergrande has made their loan payment. The only uncertainty left is their international payments.

Edit 4: Evergrande defaulted on its international debt :)",4687,2021-09-21 18:30:03,2064

In the recent hearing, the judge rejected the SEC’s motion to prevent Ripple from pursuing a fair notice defense.

Well, this has sent the [XRP price up](https://swapzone.io/currencies/ripple?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) 12% which is currently trading at $0.81 with a market cap of $39.1 billion. Although XRP continues to remain volatile with the broader market correction, today’s move helps its cover all of its last month’s loss.

Ripple CEO wrote: “While we would have preferred the cases against Chris and me to end now, the SEC must now prove its claims. We are confident that ultimately all of them will be dismissed”.

This could probably mean that the Ripple vs SEC is close enough to its conclusion.

---

###[I UNCOVERED A BILLION DOLLAR FRAUD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzbBi0agLNg)

---  

To summarise the actions of John Karony, the CEO:  

Enacted the 100% tax honeypot, covered by myself [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tuumsi/safemoons_v1_100_tax_results_in_the_theft_of/), but the major story ^(as ^though ^tens ^of ^millions ^of ^dollars ^stolen ^isn't ^a ^big ^story) is that he had a deal with the Crypto Exchange Bitmart, who ran their own version of Safemoon's ""tokenomics"" (10% buy and sell tax) - so what they would do is redistribute 5% to holders themselves, and then send 5% of transactions to Karony which Karony was supposed to add to the liquidity pool.  

####Except he did not  

He appears to have kept it.  

---

So what this means is that all the people that have gone blue in the face telling us that John was cleaning house, getting rid of all the bad apples.. well he was just as crooked as the rest of them. Truly a den of thieves.  


##Birds of a feather flock together  

What's mad is laying it all out...  

* **Kyle** who copy-pasted the contract kept withdrawing from the Liquidity Pool even while claiming you couldn't and that Safemoon was ""rugpull resistant""  
* **Thomas** who lied about his Ripple job offer, lied about his development credentials and continually siphoned funds from the liquidity pool into his own wallet  
* **John** who constantly claims Safemoon is the evolution, sets up dodgy deals with Bitmart and creates the V1->V2 honeypot  

It just goes on and on. Every week a new stone is unturned and people find more and more filth and scum.  


But it just slides off the back of the criminally-deluded Safemoon Army. Today has seen three wallets sell $500,000 between them, and we're only a few hours after the wallet released. The whales are not happy about this, but the casual holders?  

Here are some quotes from their sub...  

> Buy the DIP, Safemoon to the moon, if you sell you, then you is a low life. LOL Dimond hands baby. We will be rich in 5 years. People fud bitcoin and look where we at 10 years later. Buy the Dip and you will be rich in 5+ years.

>1 billion volume is coming...We will be on all major exchanges soon. Love these tasty dips.

> Just watched, it's bad on so many levels. But he's at least good at editing. He makes a lot of arguments but fail to provide any proof.  

#MY DUDE HE LITERALLY GAVE YOU THE BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTION HASHES IN THE VIDEO MY DUUUUUUUUDE.  

#

> The Video is pure conjecture and open-ended opinions that leads the watcher (by the nose) to form an opinion off of nothing; but it sounds good.  

#

> He's just after clicks and is trying to profit from spreading fud about safemoon for his own financial gain and popularity, nothing more  

#

> I made my mind last year. I have a goal to achieve and every new wave of fud and dip that comes after is only a great way for me to buy more.

XRP,cryptocurrency,20% dip? 🤷‍♂️ Looks pretty normal to me.,"It's April 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s making around 1.1 BTC each day. The price is crossing $2. 

It's May 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s, doubled. Mining difficulty is climbing quickly, and so is the price. We're almost at $10 by the end of the month and I'm still making around 1 BTC per day, somehow managing to stay on par with the difficulty as I buy more graphics cards.

It's early June, and as I am powering on even more GPUs, the price hits roughly $32 before halving over that weekend. 

November 2011, we reach $2 after several months of everyone declaring it dead. I am on something like 8 5850s now, probably still making around 1BTC, maybe a bit less, it's difficult to remember after 10 years. After the monstrous crash of about $30, things begin to pick up by the end of the year and we enter 2012 at about $5.

We crash from $7 to $4 between January and February, then from $13 to $8 over one weekend in August. It's dead, each time.

It's 2013 and things are batshit insane. We have some minor 10% drops through the year but everyone is buying. Everyone is mining. I heat my new rental property with Radeon 7990s and only heat the house with graphics cards during the entire winter from 2012-2013. About 11 steps up the stairs, you go from freezing cold to being blasted with heat, like when you exit the plane into Spain.

By April we all lose our shit and people are buying bitcoin for $100. By the 9th they are paying $200 and within a week decide that $70 is more reasonable - a 66% drop in a week. Of course, people can't make up their minds whether Bitcoin is a scam or if it's the future of humanity, so the price goes haywire and we see regular gains and drops of 10/20/30%.

It's November 2013. Bitcoin is not a scam. Clearly, because it's now worth $200. Or is it worth $650? No, it's worth $550. Now it's $700. Nope, $1,100. Now it's $950. 

Now it's December and it's $1,100 again. But what the hell is going on, MtGox won't let me log in despite me not sleeping and spending the last 15 hours through the night trying. Now I'm late for work and I've lost 20% of my money, even though I've actually gained 1000% this year, I'm only bothered about losing 20% of what I had a day ago, just like literally everyone else.

It's 2014. It's also most of 2015. The entirety of both years. Bitcoin is dead. Never coming back. We're down to $200. Mining still makes me the same $2-3/day that it ever has, even though the 1BTC/day from 2011 is now worth $200+/day. I give up. Everyone else gives up after buying these new things called shitcoins. I forget, not bothering to sell what I had left as it's barely enough to buy a small used car. 

It's 2016 and apparently Bitcoin has tripled since I last looked at it. What. You what. What. Everyone now wants Ethereums. It's like Bitcoin, but it'll fit on my hard drive. Everyone's shitcoins have disappeared. The however many thousands of Doggo coins I mined before I quit have disappeared along with the exchange. Ethereums are bringing out these new shitcoins that actually do something, like Golem, which is like Seti@home but will eventually literally do everything and generate an income for you. Great! Ethereum shitcoins are not called shitcoins. The world of cryptocurrency is very different to how i remember it. I swap half my BTC for ETH and then 80% of that for various tokens.

It's 2017. Nothing bad is happening. Everyone is investing in ICOs for non-shitcoins. Everyone's making $2k/day just trading. Everyone's also making $500-2k/day just holding. Everyone has bitcoin and ether, as well as a tonne of ERC-20 tokens. Some people also have Bitconnect which seems very much like the HYIPs I used to join during my PTC/PTS days as a teenager. Seems like a scam, no good. Ethereum has several 20-30% drops throughout the year. Seems normal, I'm no longer phased after 2013. Everyone in my office is interested. They all discuss it at $10, but ask me about investing $15k when the price hits $300. Finally, they enter at $600 and no one does any work for the rest of the year. We just talk crypto.

It's the second half of 2017. I make more on crypto in one day than at my day job in a month. Literally everything is going up. No one considers that it'll ever drop again. I'm like: ""🤷‍♂️ Looks pretty normal to me, but I better sell some soon else..""...

Actually, it's January to April 2018. New York bonuses or Chinese New year or some seemingly random event makes everyone sell literally everything. Everyone had put all their bitcoin into ether, and then all their ether into ICOs. What was once 25BTC was now 400,000,000 various ERC-20 tokens, or kittens, worth around $200. Not only did everyone sell their tokens, causing them to crash, but everyone sold everything else, making everything else crash. Crashception. Every second word on reddit is ""crash"".

Ether went from $1,200 to $75 in a year or so. Declared dead by everyone.

It's 2018-2020. I'm like, well, not sure. Probably will repeat the cycle of dips, moons and crashes, but probably should have sold. How many Deloreans could I have bought? Better not check my ""How many Deloreans I can afford if I traded all of my cryptos for deloreans.xlsx"" spreadsheet. My heart and soul must be dead. I have felt no emotion or regret during the crash. 2013 had used up all of that. All of my colleagues are bored and stop talking about crypto. Despite what they said, they weren't interested in the tech, only the money. One buys a folding phone for $1,500 with what was once $10k of Galaxy Ripple chocolate bars, I think. I buy more Ether, deciding to not exchange any for other tokens. From now on, only BTC and ETH for me. I buy some occasionally, but not as much as I should. I pretty much leave crypto will the expectation that we'll just repeat it all again in a few years.

It's 2021, things are batshit insane again. Already?Woopdedoo. Everyone's talking to me about crypto. Fgs. I just decided to try the real stock market where people cry over a 3% crash. Everyone is jumping back in. What is defi and nft? Are cryptokitties nft? Is my kitty still alive? Who knows. Give it 5 years and there'll be a yet another new equivalent to shitcoins.

Bitcoin drops by $10k in January, I'm like, meh. I play with Coinbase Earn and shortly make a mint.

It's the present: Bitcoin drops another 10k in February, even though it's still higher than the last drop. I'm like, meh. Everyone panics. For some reason I decide to write a 20 word reddit post and it turns into whatever the hell I'm writing now for whatever point I'm trying to make. Something about not declaring it dead over a $10k drop when we're still up by $20k this year.

It's mid 2021. Bitconnect is back and they want your doge. Bitcoin hits $80k but crashes by 20% down to $64k. The world is on fire and shit is hitting the CPU fan. It crashes by another $5k before hitting $85k. Ether was $4k but now deemed dead because it's only $2k. Soon it'll be $5k. Elon tweeted about doge being the national currency of Mars. It's a joke, but now doge is $42 and I remember that old exchange that vanished with probably $420,000,000 worth of my doge, and 50 LTC. Twelve seconds later it's back to $0.10. Everyone is mad because it is now only worth double of what it was worth yesterday, even though it is down from ,12 seconds ago.

It's every other year from now until the end of eternity.. Everything crashed by 50% overnight. Now it costs me 250 satoshis or less for my latte. Ether is $1^26 or something and no one knows what is happening anymore. The price went so high because 10 billion people on Earth use it daily, either directly or because their car automatically pays for tolls on the Ethereum network with that project from Oaken Innovations that hasn't been updated in years, that now no exchange can display it correctly or something. Everyone is now an NZT or NFT or POS or some other acronym. While I'm working, my phone earns me 0.2 GLM, my fridge earns me 4 MYST, my washing machine earns me a few E-DOGE, all while I process medical simulations and allow some family in China to access wikipedia without their government seeing. My family on Mars send me some DOGE to keep me afloat. Ripple is still being investigated by the SEC while their owners siphon another $100m each year. The price of all cryptos goes 10x every other year but it's all dead when it drops 10-20%.

It's the end of this post. I've no idea what's going on. Has the crash reverted in the time that I've written this? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I lost today? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I gained since the start of the year? I look at the price of literally every crypto and see a 10% drop after an unlimited % gain since inception and several hundred percent just this year or so.

Its the end of the end of this post. I consider how to end it, but instead have two endings. Things don't make sense. I consider changing the title to reflect my original intention of pointing out how a 10-20% drop is pretty much to be expected with crypto and that by looking at the bigger picture, you won't even see this dip on a chart next year. Instead, I do whatever I am doing now. I give up and decide to post this so I can use the reddit app to check if anyone has posted anything meaningful about NuCypher, even though I expect the usual pump posts.",10390,2021-02-23 19:10:37,722

If Ripple wins, nobody will give a poop what the SEC has to say anymore (regarding ""unregistered securities"" in particular). It will set a massive precedent and their lawsuits would feel way less significant. Just like the Ripple case, all these cases will likely drag on for years and if Ripple were to beat the SEC, those currently being sued will like their chances to do the same; that is prove these assets are not securities. 

In the case of a Ripple win, investors will also likely be a lot less afraid to continue investing in the 15 or so assets (and similar assets) that were listed as securities in those lawsuits. So much hinges on the outcome of this case. Go Ripple!",76,2023-06-07 15:58:43,95

If you aren't interested, please skip down to the main article. I'm talking about finding a way to live sustainably on this planet, regenerative agriculture, where we get our food from, and how we can make sure that our kids and grandkids have something left once we leave.

If everyone reading this planted a fruit tree, or even some wild flowers, we could save the bees.

While you are at it, planting a fruit tree has been shown to be one of the best investments on the planet. There's pretty much no investment on the planet that is more financially lucrative (while still being nearly bullet-proof safe) than planting a fruit tree.

You can get a tree at an end of sale auction for literally 5-10 bucks, and that tree will produce THOUSANDS of dollars of fruit for you in it's lifetime. Go spend $200 bucks at an end of season sale, plant 10-20 trees (if you have room), and that $200 will be worth tens of thousands of dollars of saved money.

**I also expended the ""now what happens"" section, to explain how these pullbacks are a good thing, make crypto more stable, and why we keep seeing larger ceilings after every pullback... this stuff is really important for you to make money on this thing, if that's your goal....**

I've made a similar post in a few spots, and this is something that is absolutely critical for people to understand... what impacts price, and what is going on lately. Price has only a very minor correlation with money invested, and a major correlation with opinion. 

... and Humans are an emotional bunch.

So what drives price of any commodity, crypto, gold, pizzas, whatever? The money invested in it, right? Kind of, but not really. What if I told you that you could theoretically raise bitcoin from $15k to $20k by spending $1, and lower it from $25k to $1k by spending the same $1? Crazy right?

**AN EXAMPLE**

This is going to start out slow, I want to make sure I get everyone on the same page before I pick things up and lift the curtain. Stick with me here....

This is an example to help illustrate why prices aren't driven by money invested, but rather consensus and opinion. Lets imagine the following exists (we will use bitcoin as an example, but this is how everything on the planet works)

Lets say Bitcoin is currently priced at $10k (the last sale). From $11k to $99k, every $1k there is someone with a sell order of 1 full bitcoin. From $9k to $1 dollar, every $1k on the way down there is someone with a buy order of 1 full bitcoin.

So, right now if you wanted to buy bitcoin you have several options... meet the lowest seller's price of $11k, or, put your own buy order up, above the highest buyer's bid order (overcut them). If you decide to just place an order, the price doesn't change. If you decide the buy the $11k bitcoin, now bitcoins value is $11k, with a new lowest sell offer of $12k, and a highest buy bid of $10k. Someone else comes in an overcuts the buy bid and puts 1 BTC for sale for $11k. No trades are made until someone matches a buy/sell.

Okay, that's kindergarten stuff, most people here understand that. So how much money drove the price up in this situation? $11k, and BTC price raised 11/10, 1.10, or 10% from the last sale. Now the entire marketcap of BTC raised 10% (last sale multiplied by circulating supply). So it takes $11k to drive a 10% increase, right? Not at all. Lets look at what happens when news is released.

News comes out that Warren Buffet thinks bitcoin is a scam, a bubble, and he wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because he only invests in things he understands and he doesn't understand crypto. People panic everywhere, and believe ""this guy is smart, I'm overvaluing this thing"".

Suddenly people don't want to buy this scam anymore, and the buy orders for $11k, $10, and $9k are taken down. 

At the same time, the people wanting to sell start to panic and just want out. The guy at $32k (who just had that offer up ""just incase it moons"") drops down to $11k sell order. The guy at $12k, who was the lowest, now undercuts him to $10k. 

The other buyers see the sellers undercutting and think that if these people want out, why am I buying in. The $8k guy pulls his offer, and so do the $7k, $6k and $5k guys. The highest offer is now $4k. 

The sellers panic further and the $14k guy undercuts the $10k guy and puts up a $9k sell. The $15k, 17k and 11k guys all see this flurry of panic and now a storm undercutting is triggered, to $8k, $7k, and $6k. The $8k order pulls his again and goes down to $5k. 

The price on the buy and sell orders has moved around a ton, but no sales have actually happened yet. Technically, BTC is still ""worth"" $11k, and the market cap reflects that. All this horseshit has happened, and it only happened in 10 seconds, but the price hasn't moved yet. 

The $27k guy wakes up and checks his phone. He had a $27k offer just incase the price moved also, and he also only has a tiny infinitesimal fraction of a BTC. Well, he decides ""he's out"" and fills $1 worth of the part of the $4k guys buy offer.

The latest price information is now updated, and BTC fell from $11k to $4k price per BTC with the movement of a single dollar.

This is exaggerated example, but this is what moves price. Not money in vs money out. The ONLY THING that moves price is perception.

**OPINION FLOW AND NOT MONEY FLOW**

Now the above example only happens if everyone simultaneously believe the same thing... this the asset they are holding is a steaming turd. What happens in reality is there's no black and white, it's shades of gray. It's flow in vs flow out. But again, not flow MONEY, but rather OPINIONS.

If 66% of the holders of something all of a sudden unanimously decide that their asset is overvalued, then they panic sell. Even if 33% of the people decide they are going to buy up as much as these panic sellers sell, if the panic is strong enough, and they are slitting eachother's throat to sell, then the buyers just happily sit and let them do that, and time their buys in. Very little money has to actually change hands in order for this price to crash, all that matters is the FLOW OF OPINION has to be swift and violent, and in majority. The sellers will leapfrog eachother on the way down, faster than the buyers scoop up their sales, and the net result is a crashed price.

Note, this happens both ways... fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) as well as overhyped FOMO (Fear of missing out). 

**So now what happens?**

Time goes by and all holders opinions of their asset hasn't changed. They still think it's worth $11k and they got great deals scooping up what these sellers were selling. The weak hands have left the market and have been replaced with holders. Overall, now a higher percentage of holders believe in the product they are holding and are unwilling to sell for the panic prices of the last week. Panic sellers were also replaced by new money, people who have wanted in for a while and are now in on their perceived ground floor.

Also, people who bought BTC at $1 ten years ago and have been looking for an exit to cash profits have now been replaced by either long term holders, or by these new people who are thrilled to have finally entered, and they are looking to hold long. 

So what happens on pullbacks? The number of people waiting to jump off the ship has decreased. The new ground floor is established. Are we done? Who knows, this could go on for another year, but what matters is that people who want off are getting off and people that want on are getting on. 

People who have panic sold and never believed in this in the firstplace... people who have wanted out for 10 years... they have been replaced by people who are now getting in on THEIR GROUND FLOOR, and are going to be holding long. The market is suddenly increasingly more stable today than it was yesterday, even though prices are down. 

**This is a good thing.** This is why crypto keeps bouncing back from pullbacks and reaches new higher ceilings and floors each time. Old money who wanted out, and new panic holders, they are gone. They are replaced with adopters, holders, believers in this technology. These people aren't selling anytime soon, because they believe that this thing is going to revolutionize the world. Every crash brings more of these people in, and removes more panic sellers out. 

**Moving forward**

Now news releases start coming out about how stock ETFs are being created, NASDAQ index funds, bank support, government support. Companies are using this tech, and companies who use blockchain for transportation are putting non-blockchain companies out of business. 

The people on the outside looking-in feel they are missing out. They now start coming in and buying. They start overpricing eachother on their buy orders, and eventually it gets close enough to a sell order that someone decides they are just going to meet the sell price. The sale goes through.

Sellers (HODLERs) see this action, and they start pulling sell orders off the table almost as fast as they fill. Sure some trades go through, and incoming money is driving the price up as market orders are filled. But what's also happening is people are seeing this flurry of volume, and sellers are pulling sell orders and placing them higher. 

Junk coins and pump and dump scam coins are dying by the millions. In their ashes, good solid technology projects whose coins have fundamental economic reasons for growth, these are rising. Corporate partnerships continue forming. The real world continues to create actual use cases. Companies start storing more and more corporate information on blockchain. Public companies use blockchain to store scientific research (See Canadian Research Council announcements), and blockchain acts as a Library of Alexandria. People can travel out of country without any monetary exchange, using their chosen cryptocurrency to buy the things they need abroad. The world is slowly actually USING this technology. 

Money is coming in, but more importantly, OPINION IS CHANGING. Literally nothing could have happened in terms of fundamentals, partnerships, etc... this can all be driven entirely emotional, so long as it's wide-spread and strong. Infact, the market could THEORETICALLY rebound in this way from $4000/BTC to $1 MILLION PER BITCOIN by the sale of ONE PENNY. $4000 sound low? Does that number make you uncomfortable? We may go that low. We may not. If we do, I'm not panicking and selling, I'm buying more.


**SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS? and where are we going?**

A lot of new money has come in from Nov-Jan, and they don't really know what they are investing in. Sure some of them have done great research and are smart investors but most people aren't and isntead they are buying Symbols and Names and trading on speculation. They are treating their favorite coins like a sports team, and will follow them irrationally off a cliff.

These new people came in and invested in cryptocurrency because their OPINION was heavily influenced in Nov, Dec, Jan, from media. They saw this money making machine called crypto. They were willing to pay huge, ride the wave up, keep buying, etc. They were ""ground floor adopters"" and were going to get rich.

They outnumber the old money by A LOT. Their OPINION MATTERS. It matters the most.

To keep this in perspective, they are also a VAST MINORITY of ""new money"" that will enter the game in the next decade. This cycle will continue over and over and over. 

Their opinion rose nearly unbounded and price rose accordingly. Market cap rose from 10B to 750B, and it could have been VERY LITTLE actual money that did this. How much did it need to be though? Literally ONE PENNY, theoretically. All that matters in moving price is MOMENTUM OF OPINION. I believe it has been estimated that as low as 6B USD was responsible for the bull rush.

These people then started hearing ""Bubble"", ""Scam"", Fake news about governments banning. They don't understand how technology wins, always. Crypto is beyond government control. If they could have stopped Bitcoin they would have done it already. 

**WHO IS DRIVING ALL THIS?**

Most investment opportunities go first to ""accredited investors"". You need to have multimillions in order to get in on the ground floor for most stock IPOs, and we're seeing that start to happen with coin ICOs. Bitcoin was a joke for the first few years, while lunatics picked it up. At this point, it was really too late to get in ""early"", and who would have wanted to anyways, it was all still a joke. So Wallstreet, banks, governments have generally watched on the sidelines as average Joes who were crazy enough to be early adopters and toss $100 on fake internet money slowly became millionaires. 

Not only that, but the idea of blockchain started to become understood. The power and value in it became understood. Not only as a way to track ""monetary value"" but for many other applications as well. Platforms were created, business uses brainstormed, products started being made. This thing started taking off, and wasn't a joke anymore. But regardless, big money wasn't in on the ground floor. They have stakeholders opinions to think of, and what do they say to investors when they lose all their money on magic internet points?

But they have woken up now. This thing has ""popped"" many times now and keeps recovering. This thing won't die. could they have been wrong all along? If they want in, how do they get in? They are no dummies, they have been controlling the world their whole lives? Look at the media experiment that Trump is doing? He is testing just how we work... you can do literally anything and we remember it for like 30 seconds, until the next news story comes out. We change opinions very easily. We are swayed very easily. We are their puppets. Media controls the world. They know their way in.

They have ONE WEAPON against cryptocurrency.

YOUR OPINION OF IT.

And they know it.

**Media.**

That's why FUD is so powerful and needs to be respected. It's why we need to read more than titles on news articles. We need to question what we read, **whether it's good news or bad news**. We need to think about ""what are the motives of the person saying this to me"". Does the government have a conflict of interest when they state that crypto is gambling? Do they have skin in the game? 

What about wall street? Does WEISS ratings possibly have incentive to come out with poor ratings? Do banks have incentive to lock accounts in order to ""protect"" customers from ""unsafe investments"" when their entire business model revolves around holding as much of your money as possible and making money off it? Do you think banks have any super secret hidden interest in preventing you from storing your money elsewhere? I'm not sure, maybe you can critically think about that.

Just understand that this goes both ways. When crypto is booming and Fox news is showing people how to buy $4 ripple on prime time, you may want to start putting in some stop loss orders. When the suicide hotline is stickied at the top of /r/cryptocurrency and everyone is panic selling, you may want to start picking up some firesale deals. 

So, the question is this... Is crypto undervalued or overvalued at it's price today? Where is the price going long term? **I'm not talking about it's use case**, I'm talking about in the **court of public opinion**, where is THAT going? Because THAT is what is going to drive price in the future.

Without a crystal ball, this is of course impossible to know. Do your own research and form your own opinion. It could very well be that the technology having a use-case will in and of itself drive opinion, and thus price. But make sure you understand that it's not the technology itself, it's not the value of the business itself, it's not the use case itself that will drive price, it is the publics OPINION of that thing which drives price. They are intertwined, but they are NOT the same thing.

TLDR: VERY VERY little money has to move around in order to swing prices drastically, up or down. Money in and out doesn't drive price, OPINION does. How do you let the news you read impact your opinion?How are you being played (on both sides, shilling and FUD).

Something is only worth what people think it's worth. Often that's based on reality, value, business, money, but often it's entirely emotional.

[Structure your portfolio in a balance, intelligent way, using risk methodology.](https://www.investinblockchain.com/cryptocurrency-investment-risk-management/). Invest money you are willing to lose. Support legitimate technology and teams who are actively driving their product to completion, coding, and marketing. Stop trying to make money overnight in pump and dump scams, or pyramid schemes. 

Every day, take one coin, do a deep dive on it, learn it inside and out. Look into their team and their past. Do that every day for a year, and you just learned 365 coins inside and out. Ask yourself the following key questions:

Have those members consistently jumped ship on previous projects? Is that where you want to invest in? Is their team capable of executing on their vision? Are they trying to solve world hunger, and their team is a few 16 year olds in a garage? How active is their github? Are they adding chunks of code regularly, or is a ghost town? Are they marketing their product at all? Or is marketing the only thing they are doing? 

What are the economics of their coin itself? Is it required to be used to gain access to their technology? Are there burns? How premined is it, and what portion do the founders hold? 

What about their vision? Are they trying to solve a problem that needs to be solved? What are the economics of that problem and how much money does the solution potentially save clients?

These are all questions you should be asking when you give your money to someone else. We're a lot more stable than we were - a correction was bound to happen. Too much early money wanted to cash in profits. These people have been replaced by new money who is holding on their own ground floor. The whole industry in general is still in very early stages. Rest assured that anyone reading this is still very much an early adopter. Just make sure you are investing in actual technology, and supporting capable teams, and not buying air. Buy the Googles and Amazons of Crypto, not the pets.com or flooz.com of cryptos.

Happy investing everyone.

They broke fincen rules and payed a fine. I dare say the same is going to happen with this case.

A for profit company that is trying to get banks and central banks to adopt its currency. Banks and central banks will be the last to adopt crypto and will only adopt something that the masses use.

This company only has a billion dollars in cash, has 1100 employees, and the rest of its assets, purportedly 25 billion, is in mostly ripple.

So essentially anytime the price goes up they are incentivized to sell Ripple from the balance sheet to help cover cost. What I don’t get is the ripple market cap is suppose to be 27 billion on top of all this per coin-market-cap.

This comes right after the large doge dump.

The worst part is, their moderators made no efforts to remove posts related to the scam. It is reported that /u/nvok (a moderator of /r/Ripple and /r/XRP) and fellow moderators were allowing the scam to be promoted and were removing posts that were negative towards it. They also ban any users that critique Ripple or XRP (the token of Ripple). It is unknown if they were involved in the scam, but it is evident they failed to educate their users.

XRP,cryptocurrency,"I made $458,000 in a flash crash buying XRP at 0.00004USDT each, then the exchange reversed the trades and took my profits","The story goes like this…

If you go onto the XRP/USDT pairing on LAToken and scroll back to the 23rd February you can see the price dropped to 0.00004USDT per XRP. I had placed very low limit orders prior to this that have since been filled.

When I logged into my account after placing these low bids on the market a while back, I was amazed to see I had amassed 632,151 XRP tokens.

Here’s the heart-breaking bit. I naturally was mind-blown, so I tried to sell some of the XRP in the account then withdraw my profits from the exchange elsewhere, only to have the withdrawal declined and my account temporarily closed for 1 day siting a ‘violation of our terms of use’. I have done nothing wrong and simply set low limit orders that were filled.

I contacted support asking why this has happened, they didn’t tell me why my account was restricted or what terms of use I had broken. After the 24 hours my account is back up, all the XRP is gone and I’m left with the cryptocurrency I had originally. I contact support again asking for my coins back, I get vague responses not related to the issue.

XRP,cryptocurrency,Binance is not holding verifiable proof of reserves for ETH/XRP in the BNB ecosystem and is failing to hold adequate reserves / or show reserves for most of its other cryptos. They only verify that they hold 30% of the ADA in the BNB ecosystem.,"Please also check the edit at the bottom for an update regarding lack of proof of reserves on the stables on BNB as well:

**TLDR:** Binance fails to provide adequate proof of reserves for assets in the BNB chain. Binance encourages users to withdraw their crypto into the Binance ecosystem by charging higher fees to withdraw into native ecosystems - and are failing to Provide Proof of Assets altogether or a sufficient amount in their Proof of Assets for the crypto in the Binance ecosystem. This gives Binance a huge opportunity to manipulate the crypto market by creating ""fake crypto tokens"" in the BNB ecosystem that are not backed by any underlying asset and then selling/using your assets. Furthermore, it pushes volume into BNB chain by encouraging withdraws into the BNB ecosystem that may end up not backed by any assets....

**What you need to know**

* [BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2 tokens) and BNB Smart Chain (BEP20 tokens) are two native chains of the Binance ecosystem](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/854415cf3d214371a7b60cf01ead0918). Binance allows users to withdraw lots of different crypto as tokens into their native chains which then allows users the ability to use ""those assets"" in the Binance ecosystem.
* As you can imagine, this could create a few concerns... The largest being Binance could sell/send the underlying asset of the BEP2/20 Tokens as the user no longer holds the true crypto but a token on the Binance ecosystem, essentially allowing them to manipulate the total supply of those cryptos by creating ""fake BNB tokens"" with no actual backing on the native chain.
* To ease concerns about artificial manipulation Binance began providing [Proof of Asset](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof) wallets where, for crosschain assets (Ether, XRP, ADA, Doge, etc..) they should theoretically hold an underlying asset equal to the amount of the asset that is in the BEP2/20 ecosystem. This is supposed to ensure the Binance asset you are holding is backed by an equal amount on its native chain and the supply is not being artificially manipulated.
   * The problem however is they do not provide a Proof of Asset list for most of their assets in the Binance ecosystem. Additionally of those that have a Proof of Asset wallet, most are not fully backed or actually list no real backing at all.
      * The [LTC proof of reserve address](https://blockchair.com/litecoin/address/MQSs17ECe51kqhkFPQY98wiyPvGuK5iCB6) holds 745K LTC. However there are 857k LTC in the BNB ecosystem - 725k in the [BEP20 addresses](https://bscscan.com/token/0x4338665cbb7b2485a8855a139b75d5e34ab0db94) and 132k in the [BEP2 addresses](https://explorer.bnbchain.org/asset/LTC-F07) \-  **87% backed**
      * THE [ADA proof of reserve](https://explorer.cardano.org/en/address?address=addr1q8hsff3uwtphx7dtya7unjwjwug52e5jvqp09je6pwqx8k4jvuxrw2x5rr7e258a33yzkrhhlrrc5ezvd2z7qtdq0gasme44c9) address holds 200M ADA. However there are 672M ADA in the BNB ecosystem - 241M circulating in [BEP20 addresses](https://bscscan.com/token/0x3ee2200efb3400fabb9aacf31297cbdd1d435d47) and 431M circulating in [BEP2 addresses](https://bscscan.com/token/0x3ee2200efb3400fabb9aacf31297cbdd1d435d47) \- **29.7% backed**
      * (very concerning) The following is the [listed](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof) proof of asset address [for ETHER](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9BF4001d307dFd62B26A2F1307ee0C0307632d59). It's supposed to hold all of the ETHER on the BNB ecosystem but it currently sits at .017 ETH and the ETHER was moved to [this address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf977814e90da44bfa03b6295a0616a897441acec), labeled as Binance 8. The BNB ETHER reserves were comingled with non-BNB reserve ether, meaning you can't verify how much the BNB Ether is backed verse regular user funds. - **0% verifiably backed**
      * (very concerning and easier to understand) The [XRP](https://xrpscan.com/account/rJpj1Mv21gJzsbsVnkp1U4nqchZbmZ9pM5) proof of reserves wallet for the BNB Chain is just as bad as the ETHER but since it doesn't show any tokens **it's easier to see how bad it is**. It holds a total of 10 XRP. The rest was transferred to [this wallet](https://xrpscan.com/account/rs8ZPbYqgecRcDzQpJYAMhSxSi5htsjnza) \- a general Binance wallet for XRP, which interacts with [this wallet](https://xrpscan.com/account/rDAE53VfMvftPB4ogpWGWvzkQxfht6JPxr) \- the withdrawal address for users of XRP. Again all XRP in the BNB reserves have been comingled with regular user funds not in BNB. with no way to verify they hold sufficient XRP in the BNB chain. - **0% verifiably backed**

\-----------------------------------------------------

Binance lists 35 different crypto assets in their [Proof of Assets Page](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof), however in the top 200 cryptos by market cap, over 80 of them can be withdrawn as BEP2/20 tokens. Meaning there are at least 45 cryptos assets that do not have any sort of ""proof of asset"" listed. The total number of unbacked assets is even higher, as there are assets above 200+ by marketcap that can be withdrawn into the Binance ecosystem.

Even for assets that have a proof of reserve listed that doesn't mean it is adequately backed or backed at all. For example; ETH ERC2/20 tokens have no verifiable backing, XRP ERC2/20 tokens have no verifiable backing, ADA ERC2/20 tokens are 29.7% backed. LTC ERC2/20 tokens are 86.9% backed and those are just a few of the listed assets that I checked.

\----------------------------

**Complications**: This problem has been unchecked and inflated since, I posted about this issue [6 months ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uz09wu/binance_is_encouraging_withdrawingminting_your/). Since then XRP and ETHER have lost all verifiable backing and ADA backing dropped from 71% to \~30%.

It continues to be compounded by the fact that Binance encourages users to send their crypto into BEP 2/20 tokens by making it more expensive to send the asset into the native chain. As an example Dogecoin costs 1.94 Doge to withdraw as a BEP 2/20 token and 5 Doge to withdraw into the native Dogecoin network. This is standard practice for [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/fee/cryptoFee)/[BinanceUS](https://www.binance.us/en/fee/schedule) for nearly all assets available to withdrawal into the Binance ecosystem, and the unbacked assets will likely continue to grow if left unchecked.

If the last few weeks haven't made it clear yet, the last people left holding unbacked assets end up with nothing.

# Edit:

As pointed out by [another user](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/yxxugl/comment/iwrfyhd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Binance also no longer has proof of reserves of the **PAXD or the USDC stablecoin** both of which are still circulating in the BNB ecosystem. Both appear to have been comingled with regular user funds in the Binance 8 wallet (link below).

PAXD [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8e870d67f660d95d5be530380d0ec0bd388289e1?a=0x47ac0Fb4F2D84898e4D9E7b4DaB3C24507a6D503)

XRP,cryptocurrency,Why do people still invest in XRP?,"Genuine question. It has been an under performer since the high in the 2017 bull run, since then it hasn’t been able to make new highs. The btc/xrp chart is literally down on Btc after 10 years, ripple labs is known to continuously unload tokens onto the market keeping the price down.

I was heavily invested in 2018-2019 when I entered the market but then ended up selling it all into eth which was a really great move, since then I haven’t looked back. 

Why do you guys still believe in xrp?? I don’t get it, it’s never a good sign when a coin can’t break its previous highs in a bull run. And you can’t entirely blame that on the SEC case, even without it I don’t think it would’ve gone much higher as payment solutions was not a narrative that got much attention that cycle.. and this cycle coming up I just don’t see people coming in getting hyped about xrp.

It just doesn’t stand out in any facet and I argue its time in the top 10 is coming to an end, it’s still hovering around the same price it was over 5 years ago when I entered the market. You’d be better off with most stocks at this point. what is the reason you’d pick xrp as an investment?? I just get so confused when people still think it’s a good addition to a portfolio

Edit: I actually agree with the people saying this sub is like the best reverse-indicator and I've used it before on the Solana bottom when it was being fudded hard by this sub. That being said I've heard 100s of 'XRP to the moon next week!' or 'SWIFT adoption $589 XRP in 1 month!' videos over the last 5 years and XRP has never performed, I actually hope you XRP holders are right and it moons.. I just don't see it. I'll revisit this later on in the bull market and lets see how XRP has faired to the rest of the market. It will go up with the rest of the market for sure, like it always does. I just think it will be an under-performer compared to other coins. Good luck XRP army! I'm not a hater just think it's a bad pick for a bull market",616,2024-01-31 00:23:04,589

XRP,cryptocurrency,XRP got much more love than they deserve - Ripple is heavily centralized and fights real decentralization in the crypto space,"During the SEC lawsuit, I have noticed XRP getting a lot of love from the crypto community, and I can understand this. The SEC was never only going against Ripple as we have seen this year, so this entire lawsuit was somehow representative for all of crypto.

However now that things are somehow settled, we should face reality: XRP is just another heavily centralized project, no matter if it's a security or not. The consensus mechanism is literally proof of trust - The network runs on a bunch of bank owned servers, relying on all participants being doxxed. This is not innovative blockchain tech, this is the same old banking system using ""blockchain"" as a marketing term.

I could live with that alone or ignore it at least - XRP it's by far not the only centralized cryptocurrency. However Ripple has also done their best in the past to fight real decentralized cryptos like BTC and ETH:

They often attack BTC, for example Ripple CFO claimed BTC is controlled by China in 2020 ([source](https://gizmodo.com/ripple-claims-bitcoin-is-chinese-controlled-while-annou-1845932148)). The same claims were made against Ethereum according to Vitalik Buterin ([source](https://zycrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-faults-ripples-decentralization-claim-says-the-platform-is-completely-centralized/)), for which they never apologized.

Also most of you probably remember they funded a FUD energy campaign that tried to push Bitcoin towards PoS ([source](https://decrypt.co/96298/ripple-co-founder-backs-controversial-campaign-change-bitcoin-code)).

&#x200B;

At this point people should really think twice if that's a project they want to support just because there is some bullish outlook after they won the case. Ripple is not using, but abusing ""blockchain"" - and they are certainly not your friends.",532,2023-08-01 12:13:25,502

The SEC does NOT want to risk any ruling that results in precedent going against them. 

They handed over the emails. 

So right now this lawsuit is wrapping up, final submissions are being made and the SEC’s argument is very weak. Multiple amicus briefs are being submitted in support of Ripple. Some of these completely destroy the SEC’s argument and highlight the fact they are not protecting investors.

So as we reach the pointy end, the SEC won’t leave this in the judges hands, even if they do then they have to deal with the fair notice defence. If those emails are as damaging as the Ripple team say, expect settlement.

&#x200B;

Money\_talk\_tok announced on 24 February 2022 that he bet his house on XRP when XRP was around $0.69 (nice). The amount was $500K. He did that ""because there is so much fear in the market. Be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy"". Yes this is a literal quote from the video.

https://preview.redd.it/3sakchq67e2b1.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9407aa4bea91e8fcc69b1f8ac9fa158b3c78b87

His rationale for buying was based on the Fear & Greed Index because the market was at complete fear. Even though back then the Fear & Greed index was ""only"" at 23.

His ""investment"" went up initially, but then dropped 59% from the point of buying XRP, meaning that his $500K through mortaging his house was worth $205K 114 days later.

https://preview.redd.it/nedswkqv9e2b1.png?width=1217&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfb397417bc412507a86c2a20f25fc0089af39ee

Right now, he is still down about 33% from his initial investment, even if XRP saw a 103% pump off the lows, which now retraced some again. Through in his words ""have I lost money? No I havent, because I havent sold"". 1 XRP = 1 XRP in his mind.

Why on earth would someone do this!?

Only top 50 altcoin that has its price still slightly higher than prior to XRP ruling is XLM which was on 10 cents prior to ruling, and now it is treading around 11 cents, but even that could be erased very soon considering the constant downshift towards the bottom.

XRP,cryptocurrency,"Ripple’s XRP soars 30% - why you should be supporting Ripple, regardless of your opinion on XRP","I’m sure most of you here have seen XRP’s staggering performance today. The reason for this post is because most people on this sub dislike XRP due to its centralised nature. However, the following reason - in my opinion - is why everyone should be cheering for Ripple in the ongoing lawsuit, no matter your opinion on XRP.

Let’s face it, XRP holders have had a rough few years after the lawsuit was announced in December 2020. However, as the years have gone on, we have seen countless amazing projects enter and drop out of the top 10 - Chainlink, Monero, Tezos - to name a few. Guess which coin has amazingly retained its top 10 spot, despite having the SEC on its back? You guessed it: XRP.

Regardless of whether you hold, love or hate XRP, Ripple are doing what pretty much all of us would love to do, and that’s give a huge middle finger to the SEC. One must realise that an SEC victory will put so many other projects under scrutiny, and this will not favour crypto well as a whole. We will witness many of our favourite projects being placed under the microscope of the regulators. However, if the lawsuit ends with a Ripple victory, it may potentially set up crypto for a (mini) bull run, as regulators are forced to lay off as we see some sort of regulatory clarity in our beloved industry. The crypto industry as a whole is likely to piggy-back off the success of the lawsuit, should we see a favourable victory. No one wants to be in Ripple’s position, but I’m sure we can all appreciate that Ripple has taken one for the team and is fighting one of the most important battles - not just for themselves, but for the entire crypto industry.

This image is the XRP price chart. XRP is showing a similar structure to Bitcoin's previous cycle but just behaving much more slowly which is why most people think the project is dead, retail investors don't have much patience. We observe that XRP crashed to $0.11 in 2020, then retraced to around the 0.618 at $2 in 2021, followed by re-accumulation in 2022-23 and now I believe we are about to enter the price expansion phase. If XRP was achieve a full 4.236 extension like bitcoin, then the target would be above $10.

Both the structure of bitcoin and XRP show: crash, retrace, re-accumulation and now price expansion.

However, I would like to offer some balance as well and want to re-iterate that XRP must break the 2021 high of $2 to show confirmation of an uptrend. Otherwise, it may make another lower high and that would cause XRP to deviate away from what BTC did last cycle. This bullish thesis hinges on XRP being able to break that 2021 high, so pay close attention to that.

I also believe that 2024 will be make or break for XRP. As I expect the inevitable hard landing of the US economy in the second half of this year. It's pretty much now or never for coins like XRP. If it is unable to do anything meaningful this year, I will have to conclude the project is dead because once the macro conditions turns ugly, there is no chance for any crypto to do well in that environment. The stock market is the force that drives crypto bull runs. However, I remain hopeful that we get our XRP bull run this year.

Most people on this subreddit hate XRP which is again another reason to be bullish. The herd of retail investors is generally wrong. They all expected 100k in 2021, they all thought crypto died in 2022, they all expected 12k in 2023, they hated Solana at the lows...the list is endless. When has the herd of retail investors ever been right about anything? Now they all expect the bull run to last until late 2025 lmao.

I am a firm believer of ""show me the chart and I will tell you the news"", so I am expecting some bullish narrative to emerge for XRP, who knows. Regardless, I think we can all agree that 2024 will be pivotal for coins like XRP. Look forward to hearing your thoughts!

I believe it will appreciate in price. But I am not blind to its faults and there some misinformation here because people claim that XRP has no inflation and is deflationary:

And while it is true that all XRP might be pre-mined and capped at 100 billion, we have definitely seen plenty of inflation, meaning that there is quite a lot of inflation in the supply:

* Supply 25 June 2017: 38,291,387,790
* Supply 24 June 2018: 39,245,304,677
* Supply 23 June 2019: 42,501,950,124
* Supply 28 June 2020: 44,257,803,618
* Supply 25 June 2021: 46,265,302,471
* Supply 24 June 2022: 48,343,101,197
* Supply 25 June 2023: 52,254,289,650

**That is a 33.85% increase in 6 years!** 

This supply inflation is actually rather high (though partly offset by the burns):

But let's face it. That's like USD having 50% of its supply hidden that gets slowly released (inflating the supply of USD) and then claiming its not inflation because that 50% hidden supply was already ""pre-mined"". Thats not how it works.

XRP,cryptocurrency,"XRP news abound this week! Former Ripple chair Barr Confirmed as new Fed Chief, Judge Netburn named the SEC 'hypocrites' in ruling, McCaleb (XLM) dumping nearly done. Whew!","My goodness friends, what a week for Ripple. XRP holders, catalysts abound yet we remain stuck in by the bears. Let's do a quick recap anyway, and hope that the market begins to reflect the bullish news:

Michael Barr Confirmed: Michael Barr, a former Ripple adviser, is set to assume one of the most important U.S. regulatory roles after winning Senate confirmation to be vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve. Barr is considered an ally to crypto, but has tempered his sentiments with expectations that the market be regulated robustly. This appointment is widely considered good for crypto, and considering it's issues with the SEC - good for Ripple.

Netburn says 'the Hinman emails must be produced': The long awaited ruling has finally come down from Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn regarding the attorney-client privilege of conversations had with SEC lawyers by William Hinman. Judge Netburn unequivocally ruled in favor of Ripple, even slamming the 'hypocrisy' of the SEC in its attempted defense - asserting that the SEC isn't even attempting to follow the law in good faith. In his now infamous speech Hinman said that Bitcoin and Ethereum were not to be considered securities, despite ETH having conducted the same kind of unregistered token offerings as Ripple. The preperatory emails Hinman exchanged with SEC lawyers have been desperately guarded to this point, and it remains to be seen what the SEC will do. It seems likely that there will be a series of appeals to Judge Analise Torres, who is responsible for ruling on any appeals to Judge Netburn's decisions.

Jed's dead baby: Former Ripple CTO Jed McCaleb is almost done selling his 9 billion XRP after nearly 8 years. Jed left Ripple after having differences with the leadership team on the direction of the project there. Jed has since worked to bring Stellar (XLM) into the crypto space as a competitor to Ripple within the global payment settlement industry. It is believed that Jed has nearly completed selling his stack of XRP, (he holds approximately 10 million in his TacoStand account) which is estimated to be gone by weeks end. XRP fans are ecstatic about this, as the downward selling pressure has been significant from McCaleb for nearly a decade.

Other notes: Did you know that Ripple only controls about 5% of nodes on the XRPL? XRP is more decentralized than many crypto projects. The community drives most innovations on chain as well, and will soon deliver Smart Contracts to XRPL in a 100% community driven effort, minus any Ripple devs. Congrats!

XRP,cryptocurrency,If XRP/ Ripple can defeat the SEC it'll benefit whatever you hold.,"This may seem obvious, but this is by far the longest drawn out legal battle in the space, Ripple is one of the large players in this space (capital) money wise. This explains why the SEC have been unable to simply threaten them and get them to settle for an undisclosed amount.

So far this looks good for crypto because it shows us that the space won't simply vanish because of a few powerful people wanting to control or to get rid of it. Gary Gensler has gone unhinged and attacked many other crypto companies as well, this looks a lot like frustration.

It's like Ripple and XRP are this fortress that they know they need to conquer because then the others will be much easier. They've been stalemated for years now and it's beginning to become quite a circus, especially with the space just growing and growing even through a supposedly upcoming recession.

XRP,cryptocurrency,"[SERIOUS] XRP Won, Grayscale Won: Who's Next? Coinbase and Binance?","XRP and Grayscale have both won their quests to get their products approved by the SEC. First, XRP won its lawsuit against the SEC, and now Grayscale won a court ruling to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

A three-judge appeals panel vacated a decision by the SEC that blocked the ETF, ruling that the SEC had failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two BTC futures ETPs but not Grayscale's proposed BTC ETP.

Exact words:

>The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale’s proposed bitcoin ETP. In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale’s petition for review and vacate the Commission’s order.

And the victories of XRP and Grayscale are a major setback for the SEC, which has been criticized for its slow and cautious approach to cryptocurrency regulation. The SEC has been hesitant to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, arguing that they could be susceptible to fraud and manipulation. However, the appeals panel found that the SEC had not provided any evidence to support this claim.

Grayscale has said that it is actively reviewing the details outlined in the Court's opinion and will be pursuing next steps with the SEC as the SEC has not yet replied on the decision. It remains to be seen whether the SEC will approve Grayscale's Bitcoin ETP or be a crybaby again and appeal the ruling.

This is really big, and it could lead to more investment in the market by large entities. The ruling could also prompt other regulators to take a closer look at the cryptocurrency market, and soon we might have proper rules and regulations. It's a major win for Grayscale and for the industry as a whole and could pave the way for spot bitcoin ETFs to be approved by the SEC.

Now, after XRP and Grayscale won their respective cases against the SEC, it's now Coinbase's turn to show the SEC's bias against cryptocurrency. Sooner or later, Gary is going to get sacked, it's personal now.

**After Effects:**

* **Coinbase share price rose 15%**
* **Grayscale Bitcoin Trust soared 17%**
* **Bitcoin gained 6%**
* **Total Crypto Market Cap 6%**
* **Altcoins Market Cap 3.7%**

XRP,cryptocurrency,"ETH is bad, and I am tired of pretending it's not.","I am going to open up by saying that some of the following is going to be FACT and some of it will be OPINION. However, the opinion will never prevail over the facts. Also, depending on traction I may do a second post with some more up to debate things.  
I also know that the title alone will lead to downvotes, some of you won’t even read it before downvoting. It is a shame that people forgot downvotes are supposed to be used to penalize off-topic and not to punish unpopular opinions, not to create echo chambers.    
So let’s get to it shall we?   

**ETH is shady:**  
Not only is ETH a security, it has always been manipulated by well connected and powerful people behind the scenes. The connections between the ETH Foundation, ConsenSys, and the SEC are totally public knowledge. 
Jay Clayton, the former SEC chairman, was a partner at Sullivan and Cromwell.    
Joe Lubin, co-founder of ETH, also founded ConsenSys. He also bought 9.5% of ETH supply.   
ConsenSys is a client of Sullivan and Cromwell.  
That was the back door ETH used to get the free pass on regulations.  
There are court papers about the meetings between ConsenSys and the SEC.  
At the same time, the SEC was prosecuting DOZENS of ICOs that were using the exact same approach ETH was.  
Hinman’s, Clayton’s Director of Corporate Finance, speech where he says ETH is not a security was partly WRITTEN by some of ETH top investors.  
The plan by ConsenSys with the help of the SEC was clearly to make ETH the only crossborders payment platform by giving it a free pass, while at the same time preventing any incursion into that space with SEC lawsuits.   
At the same time this was happening, Gary Gensler told an MIT audience that “XRP deserved regulatory clarity”.  (I won’t go in depth with the Ripple lawsuit here).  
Not only is Chairman Gensler trying to pretend he never said that, and the entire SEC trying to hide the fact they gave ETH a free pass, to date ETH is the only altcoin to have had the privilege of being formally consider a commodity/currency and not a security.   
Other funny “coincidences” include: Claydon being hired by a crypto hedge fund 100% invested in BTC and ETH. SEC Enforcement Director Marc Berger being hired by Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett, part of the ETH Alliance and Hinman’s prior employer, less than a month after the Ripple lawsuit was filled. Hinman receiving $15 Million, during his service on the SEC, from  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett. AND after leaving the SEC, Hinman returned to  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett as a senior crypto adviser.  

**ETH is centralized:**  
Users and nodes have no real power to shape the protocol. This is virtually true of all protocols with a Foundation at it’s head, but we can’t forget ETH falls under this group.  
The first piece of evidence here is the ETC hard fork. This fork happened because the wrong people lost money. The changed the code and the protocol for the first time to suit the wealthy whales and not the users or miners. They changed the rules to fit their goals.    
The second piece comes in the form of changes to mining rewards. This was a blatant attempt to decrease supply by not paying the miners. More important than the way it impacts the economics of ETH, it points towards a centralisation of power. Rules can be changed on the fly with no consideration from the community but based on profits alone for the higher ups.  
This leads us to the PoS change. This has nothing to do with energy concerns or with price of fees. This is meant to skip all the intermediate problems by getting rid of miners and let the token holders leverage their will directly. Don’t forget the LUDICROUS amount of ETH that was pre-mined.  
Every hard fork the Ethereum blockchain has enacted has always been for the benefit of the few, never for the benefits of the community. You know what that looks like? Our current banking system. Where the citizens and the working class pay the price for mistakes and reap none of the rewards for profit.  
People in this sub hate central bank digital currencies, failing to see that every abuse these could enact on the public, so can Ethereum upon it’s users.    
To quote one of my sources “Etherium is not a decentralized peer-to-peer system. It is a system with an unaccountable ruling class exploiting the working class, making promises they can’t keep, while spinning a wonderful narrative.”  
  
**ETH recent and future design is bad:**  
Everyone was fooled into thinking EIP 1559 was going to be a good thing. How the Foundation pulled that off is honestly mind boggling.  
This change made it so fees were more uniform. Uniformly high. And making sure that miners saw none of that profit by burning it.   
Burning the fees essentially made sure that the biggest holders get they profits increased because every ETH is worth more, while miners that actually keep the network safe get a pay cut because there are less fees per block for them.  
But the biggest problem is that you are getting a landlorded network to users. If you want ETH to be useful, you need to, well, use it. But this model makes it so the interests of holders are opposite to the interests of users. Users want lower fees so they can use the network to transact, but holders want higher fees, for more burn and more profit.  
Taking money out of the pockets of miners decreases security. If you are paid less you have a higher incentive to get your money some other ways.   
And since users and holders have different agendas, future goals benefit different people. An interesting question would be for instance what happens in the case of a block size adjustment? Bigger or smaller block sized benefit users and holders differently.
Well, given ETH’s history, you know how those chips would fall. Even this decision was reached by a small amount of key players.  
And PoS will only make this whole process more straight forward. The fact that the token holding are already so centralized will make changes easier for the ruling class and be baked into the system.    

**In conclusion:**    
ETH’s had a shady start, has been controlled by a group of shadow players on the background, is becoming less and less secure and has no intention of not being.    
At any point, any decision can be hard forked in. The miners don’t matter. Your nodes don’t matter.  
ETH is INTENDED to shackle you the exact same way the current banking system does.    
Don’t be fooled.

They are also one of the first ones being centralized and with that do not exactly mirror what Crypto should have been according to Satoshi Nakamoto. They may also have a high amount of whales which makes it quite manipulative. But still I love them right now as they are the ones standing up against the SEC.

The Ripple-SEC lawsuit probably has been a defining moment of Crypto. It was one of the first attempts by the SEC to just shut Crypto off and make the whole world leave it. That obviously did not go as they planned IT. XRP actually stood up against them and continues that lawsuit for like four years now.

It's very likely that this lawsuit concludes this year maybe even in summer as many lawyers said. In that case that may be the most important upcoming Crypto event.

XRP,cryptocurrency,I hold XRP out of respect because they're taking it for the team...,"XRP Ripple is slugging it out in court, they could have settled to the EVIL EMPIRE (THE USA) but they didn't. They held their ground because the FEDs were being bullies and really haven't established a firm definition on crypto and seemed to use definitions on a whim. 

Ripple is a real-time macro settlement system, currency exchange and remittance network created by Ripple Labs Inc., a US-based technology company. Released in 2012, Ripple is built upon a distributed open source protocol, and supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodities, or other units of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes. Ripple purports to enable ""secure, instantly and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks."" The ledger employs the native cryptocurrency known as XRP.

In December 2020, Ripple Labs and two of its executives were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for selling XRP tokens, which the SEC classified as unregistered securities.

However, it was evident in the trial that XRP told Ripple earlier (court document revealed) that they weren't a security.

I am baffled why the judge has not thrown out this case. However, there are rumours that XRP might settle.

The devil is in the details. XRP Ripple has signaled that they wil be hiring several hundreds of people. A JP Morgan report sent to investors earlier this month put XRP and the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit under the spotlight and concluded that a win would put the crypto asset on the road to mainstream adoption. More on that, here.

Coinbase, which was mentioned as a key player for XRP adoption, announced it will participate in the forum and will be represented by CEO Brian Armstrong and Lead Independent Director Fred Wilson. 

Ripple has successfully accelerated its global expansion this year despite fears that the lawsuit could cause hesitancy among institutional partners. Now it seems that the blockchain firm will be hiring a few hundreds in 2022 as they prepare the launch of the upcoming Liquidity Hub.

On top of that, the XRP Ledger has just had a “game-changer” upgrade that took a year to come into effect and it’s likely to strengthen its appeal. Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz said it was “awesome news”.

So, in conclusion, where RIPPLE goes so goes the industry as they say.",193,2021-12-01 14:02:13,222
XRP,cryptocurrency,"ADA, Matic, Atom, Sol, Algo and others were deemed a security a week ago. When this happened to XRP, XRP also dropped hard for a week straight. After that week, XRP did a 11x in 15 weeks.","Almost 7 days ago, the SEC called many popular tokens a security, such as Cardano, Matic, Solana, Atom, Algorand, Near, and others. They have all seen major losses over the past week. In 7 days, they dropped:

* ADA: -19%
* Solana: -22%
* Matic: -24%
* Atom: -9%
* Near: -14%
* Algo: -10%

Fear is high, and many people have sold or are considering selling. Is it over for these cryptocurrencies? Perhaps not!

&#x200B;

A similar thing happened to XRP, when Ripple was sued by the SEC on December 22, 2020, because XRP was alleged to be a security. XRP instantly started crashing and went down 67% in a week! A much more severe reaction. Everyone panicked and thought it was over. Many people capitulated.

[XRP capitulation: -67&#37; in 7 days.](https://preview.redd.it/orsw1v4ee86b1.png?width=1877&format=png&auto=webp&s=877b3a04fafa9dd6c10500fa93bd0c28534250d7)

.. but it was not the end. A week after the lawsuit started, XRP hit the price of $0.17. That was the ultimate buying moment. From that point, XRP did about a 11x to $1.96 in 15 weeks! Also, the $0.17 price was not seen again.

If you bought the blood, you would still be up more than a 2x now. That said, even now, XRP is below the price of $0.52 - the price it had when Ripple was sued by the SEC.

Im not saying that the same thing must happen to the alts called a security now. But it might be good to know that buying the blood with XRP paid off. It was the final shakeout (""spring"") before liftoff.",82,2023-06-15 19:42:02,150

Does anyone expect XRP to breakout and pull away from the rest of the market do to an increase in utility in the coming months? Or do we expect it to tag along with the market like usual?

XRP,cryptocurrency,"Ripple will deploy 200 million new XRP on the market this month; a dive into XRPs supply inflation | Every month, 1 billion XRPs become available for Ripple spending and can impact the market","*\*this report was* [*originally posted*](https://portaldobitcoin.uol.com.br/como-funciona-o-processo-que-vai-colocar-novos-r-460-milhoes-em-xrp-no-mercado-este-mes/) *on* ***Portal do Bitcoin*** *(in Portuguese-BR).*

Ripple, the company responsible for the XRP cryptocurrency, unlocked one billion units in July and, of that total, kept 200 million for itself. The amount can be put into circulation at any time and this inflationary process is repeated every month, which may impact the price and investments in the asset.

These XRPs held by Ripple in July amounts to around $94 million, at the time of writing, and the company has absolute freedom to use (or sell) these crypto assets as it sees fit.

In the case of selling, the amount represents more than 10% of the average daily trading volume of XRP on the market, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/) — which could impact its price.

Analysing [Binance’s order book](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/XRP_USDT?theme=dark&type=spot), responsible for the highest liquidity of XRP in the market, 200 million would be enough to completely clear all buy orders on all available spot pairs this Sunday (9).

This event, which can create strong selling pressure, is repeated every month and will continue like this for at least the next four years.

I’ve delved into XRP’s supply inflation system to understand and explain how these monthly releases works.

## How XRP supply inflation works

When XRP was created in 2012, the currency's ledger programmed a maximum of 100 billion units. Of which 20 billion was initially distributed between its creators and the core team behind the project.

80 billion came under the control of Ripple's treasury, which promised not to use the entire available supply at once, but to spend these coins gradually. In 2017, the team decided to [implement](https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-escrows-55-billion-xrp-for-supply-predictability/) a new system, aiming to provide more predictability in increasing the circulating supply (which moves from the Treasury Accounts to the market).

The [escrow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escrow.asp) system was implemented. It is a type of [smart contract](https://ripple.com/insights/explanation-ripples-xrp-escrow/) that locks XRPs, making their use impossible, to be unlocked under some previously programmed conditions.

Ripple’s condition was to unlock one billion XRP on the first day of each month of each subsequent month, for a total of 55 months — or 55 billion XRP that still remained to be put into circulation.

However, even with a monthly release of a billion, not all of it was spent or sold by the company. In this way, Ripple began to lock in the remaining amount monthly, in new escrow contracts for the future. Extending the 55-month deadline for all XRPs to be released.

According to Messari, the XRP circulating supply has already increased by 8% in the last 12 months. Resulting in an approximate annual inflation in this value. There are currently 52.25 billion XRP circulating in the market.

## Where are the 1 billion XRP unlocked in July?

Following the onchain trails of Ripple's latest escrow release, I’ve found that out of the total 1 billion XRP, 800 million were rescheduled to be unlocked within \~3,5 years.

100 million adds to the previous 900 million for release on December 1, 2026; while 700 million started a new escrow that will only be unlocked on the first day of 2027.

Still, Ripple kept 200 million liquid XRP for this month.

https://preview.redd.it/habpwgudqxab1.png?width=2008&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f794b5ce21eb214bdab0fbcc14f5180f09d7b9c

In the cash flow graph, one billion XRP were unlocked (by escrow) on July 1, 2023. Split into five transactions, destined for two wallet addresses controlled by Ripple: [Ripple (22)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rp6aTJmW3nq1aKt3Jmuz4DPRxksT5PBjpH) and [Ripple (23)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rsjFB8mPWqiZgPUaVh8XYqdfa59PE2d5LG).

Each address received 500 million XRP. The Ripple (23) address forwarded everything to another address controlled by the company, [Ripple (10)](https://xrpscan.com/account/r9UUEXn3cx2seufBkDa8F86usfjWM6HiYp), which total value was fully locked in the new escrow for January 1, 2027.

The 500 million XRP received by Ripple (22) were split into two new transactions:

* 200 million sent to [Ripple (1)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rBg2FuZT91C52Nny68houguJ4vt5x1o91m), which remain liquid and available for use by Ripple;
* 300 million sent to [Ripple (11)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rB3WNZc45gxzW31zxfXdkx8HusAhoqscPn), which was again split and locked into two different escrows. One expiring on December 1, 2026 (100 million XRP); and another on January 1, 2027 (200 million XRP).

***Find the full blog post with all the tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the FOUR YEAR REPORT for the 2018 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, NEM, DASH, IOTA,** and **Stellar.**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting every single month for four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and more recently, the [2022 Top Ten a few weeks ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/). ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.
* **December** **Highlights:** A bloody, all-red month
* **Overall since Jan. 2018:** **ETH** solidly in the lead, followed by **BTC** and **ADA.**  After briefly pulling ahead earlier in the year, ***the 2018 Top Ten are now significantly underperforming the S&P 500*** over the same time period.  Q: So, big crypto fail, right?
* A: Only if I stopped after the first year.  The **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 406%, much, much better than traditional markets over the same time period (**fancy new chart at the very bottom of the post).

***Some exciting new changes for*** [2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!***

1. I'll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis (down to two reports per month)
2. Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time. 
3. Factoring in stablecoin gains:  In past years, I have not included the ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports.  This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).
4. Giveaways: Who doesn’t love a good old fashioned giveaway? I’ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I’m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.
5. Friendly competition: I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP r/TotalCryptoMarketCap) to see which one outperforms.

And here we go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Four Year Report – UP 34%

https://preview.redd.it/c3c6wlctpgb81.jpg?width=1056&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=380248b14486edaa5749fba7a390198bf81260a0

Welcome to the four year report!

The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, IOTA, NEM, Dash,** and **Stellar**.  

December highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **100% red month**. **IOTA** falls the least, only down -4% (on news that staking on the Firefly wallet will yield two cryptos, Assembly and Shimmer).
* **ETH** maintains a solid overall lead, **BTC** in second place, **ADA** in third.  Three coins in the green since January 2018.
* After four years, the 2018 Portfolio is +34%, behind the S&P 500’s ROI over the same time period.

## December Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in ranks since January 2018:

https://preview.redd.it/ulc9dwgvpgb81.jpg?width=412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2eadc9a98ec75b726cef37af7cb716fddf3126db

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:** After four years of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have remained.  **NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA**, and **Litecoin** have been replaced by **Binance Coin, Tether**, **DOT, SOL**, **LUNA**, and **USDC.  NEM** looks like it wants to be the first to drop out of the Top 100.

## December Winners and Losers

***December Winners*** –  **IOTA** outperformed the pack, dropping only -4% this month. 100% of the cryptos in the red.

***December Losers*** –   Losing nearly a third of its value, **Litecoin** fell the most, down -30%. **NEM** followed **LTC**, dropping -27% in December.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After four years, here’s a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment. 

https://preview.redd.it/lisz7rgxpgb81.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbf41f94e9716f0140f3a7dfff3f655fa9d21a59

With 11, **Bitcoin** has two more monthly wins than second place **Cardano**.  **NEM** has finished last place most often (12 months out of 48).

**Bitcoin** is still the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).

## Overall Update –  2021 ends with a whimper. After four years, ETH in first place, and Dash and NEM tied for worst overall performance.

After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in [October](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46), the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio continued to lose value.  After four years of holding these cryptos, only 3 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green: **BTC,** **ETH,** and **ADA.**

Overall, first place **ETH** (+413%) is well ahead of **BTC** (+257%) and third place **ADA** (+99%).

The initial $100 invested in first place **ETH** four years ago?  It’s worth $515 today.

**DASH** and **NEM** are virtually tied at the bottom, both down over -86% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.**  The initial $100 invested in each four ago is worth about $13 today.  

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/mldnsr7zpgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=d82435bc0e39657707f2143fb5dd1951f6ddcfd1

End of December 2021 market cap: **$2,211,626,655,207**

The total crypto market dropped significantly in December.  Crypto as a sector is still up +285% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+34%), the return of the S&P (+78%) over the same period of time, and nine of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for **Ethereum)**.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.65T in** [**October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/)**.**

## Bitcoin dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/qygnx0a0qgb81.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=567958cf7214839fa7befa749d61125dade6a9a8

**BitDom** declined a bit in December, ending the month at 40.2%.  When looking at the entire four year 2018 Experiment time frame, **BTC** dominance is near the low end.  For context:   

Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**33% in January 2018**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one).

High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: 

https://preview.redd.it/cxtd9lb1qgb81.jpg?width=339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25b3da0034194812e2b66f977450fff1555b48fb

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost $325 in December.

If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, **the $1000 initial investment would be worth $1,341**, up 34% from [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

Green is unfamiliar territory for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio and a recent development.  Over the first four years of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only ten months of green.  And all ten of the green months have come in 2021. 

Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment four years ago:

https://preview.redd.it/cbumx113qgb81.jpg?width=654&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bba9861143359ff6b70ff0ca8e6ba75de5d00d6

The all time high for this portfolio is [October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46) (+72%).  The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down [\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).   

Remember: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.  The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.

But I didn’t stop the Experiment in 2018:  I invested another $1000 in the ***2019***, ***2020,*** and ***2021*** Top Ten Cryptos as well (***(and, just announced,*** [***again in 2022***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!)***.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?    

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48): up +34% (total value $1,341)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36) up +504% (total value $6,044)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24): up +795% (total value $8,951)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +292% (total value $3,921)

So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,257** ($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).

**That’s up +406%** on the combined portfolios, **down from** [**last month’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47) for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/xcl80o35qgb81.jpg?width=511&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2cd4923360a5492259faf606b3649c893fd4b16

***That’s a +406% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four years in a row.***

## Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.

After four years: the S&P 500 is up +78% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) would be worth $1,780 had it been redirected to the S&P.  That’s more than double the +34% return of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio over the same period of time.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,430** ($1,780 + $1,900 + $1,480 + $1,270)

That is up **+61%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+406%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

Here’s a fancy new chart showing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

XRP,cryptocurrency,"For the newcomers: the top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence.","I tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
15. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
17. **Bitcoin SV (BSV)\*:** Bitcoin Scam Variant
18. **EOS (EOS):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
19. **Elrond (EGLD):** Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR)\*:** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
37. **SushiSwap (SUSHI):** a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
38. **Binance USD (BUSD):** Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.
39. **FTX Token (FTT):** It’s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.
40. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the token of Crypto.com public blockchain, that tries to enable transaction worldwide between people and businesses.
41. **Filecoin (FIL):** a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services.
42. **UMA (UMA):** it builds open-source infrastructure in order to create synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain
43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",14815,2021-02-09 12:03:25,1588

XRP,cryptocurrency,"Once XRP/ETH is declared a security, the entire crypto bubble is going to burst","Howey Test determines what qualifies as an ""investment contract"" and would therefore be subject to U.S. securities laws.

99% of coins shilled on this sub passes the Howy test as defined below:

1. An investment of money
2. In a common enterprise
3. With the expectation of profit
4. To be derived from the efforts of others

Certain cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) may be found to meet the definition of an ""investment contract"" under the test, especially ETH and XRP.

ETH ICO was conducted by a small group of centralised heads, VC investors, developers, as with any private company (therefore not decentralised) and carried out in Switzerland to circumvent SEC regulations. 

Now that ETH has gone PoS and has locked up billions of dollars worth of tokens for “staking”, we have a particularly odd situation where only a couple developers have the power to write the code to return the locked up funds back to retail investors. This is no different to an investment contract applied to any regulated publicly traded company.

BTC is the only cryptocurrency that is universally agreed upon (by regulators SEC and CFTC) to be a commodity. That is all. 

https://www.devere-group.com/sec-confirms-bitcoin-is-a-commodity-three-key-takeaways-for-crypto-investors/

Therefore everything else will eventually be scrutinised as a security thus the likes of Ripple, Cardano and ETH foundation will have to go public with *full* financial disclosures.

You can bet on all potential investors evaporating immediately once this happens and all the alts in the space will fall like dominoes.

I’m well aware my take will get obliterated by downvotes but if you think the SEC will continue to let things go as they are without clamping down on Securities Trading then you my friends are absolutely deluded bag holders.",0,2022-12-17 11:14:15,238

XRP,cryptocurrency,Congrats to anyone who (like me) hodled XRP for the past 3-4 years!,"In early January 2018, I was persuaded to fomo into XRP, promised it'd make me one day rich...

Little did I know what I was about to get into, or that I was about to throw huge chunks of money too close to this shitcoin's ATH.

The following 3-4 years became all about hodling and pretty much accepting that my money was as good as lost, and that was fine, seeing as I knew the risks involved.

Today, for the first time since that trade first went into negative figures, I am seeing it turn green again, and I wanted to congratulate anyone else who like me has had the patience and endurance of hodling similar shitcoins for so long.

Never give up guys, and have a great day!

EDIT: I'm blown away by the amount of toxicity this post has received. Just to clarify a few things: I am NOT new to crypto and XRP was merely my first ever investment back in 2018, and now makes up a tiny percentage of my portfolio.

Regardless, some of the arrogance being displayed by some of these self-proclaimed ""experienced"" traders/investors towards anyone they deem to be new to crypto, is one of the main recurring issues I keep on coming across in this sub. Honestly, what is the point?

XRP,cryptocurrency,Can anyone inform us what the point of XRP is now?,"If you dig far enough back in to my post history you'll see that I was active in the XRP subreddit. I'm not here to pick fights or argue with people. At the time, my thought process was, ""Ok, they have people lobbying in congress to make friendly regulation for crypto-remittances via banks. This seems cool. And I don't like having to make a 50 USD copay to send 100 USD to another country. This seems logical.""          

When I see a product like Strike where remittances are possible on bitcoin with lightning (albeit presently only to and from the US, and to and from El Salvador, to and from Argentina, and within all of these regions), I see something that is arguably a working product, or at least a product in development that seems to work.               

A long time ago I made a post that said basically something like, ""Bitcoin on lightning has just done what XRP on Xrapid wants to do without the need to go through a bank.""

XRP,cryptocurrency,Why are XRP and XLM on a tear lately?,"Maybe its due to the ""banking crisis"" or maybe its wishful thinking that the SEC will lose its case against Ripple. Maybe its both.

XRP is up 16% in the last 7 days and XLM is up 20%. What hype is driving this run in the midsts of the bear market? Let's learn a little about both projects first.

In the world of crypto currency that aims to improve if not replace banking transactions for the average human things like XRP and XLM provide improvements in remittance and asset tokenization. For example XRP's, five main applications of the XRP Ledger are payments, tokenization, DeFi, CBDCs and stablecoins.  What is important is this. They claim that using their ledger include its low-cost ($0.0002 to transact), speed (settling transactions in 3-5 seconds), scalability (1,500 transactions per second) and inherently green attributes (carbon-neutral and energy-efficient). XLM is very similar and rides on XRP's co tail so whatever happens to Ripple may bring success or failure to the Stellar Foundation. This is not changing anytime soon. XLM goes as XRP goes. 

Now that you know a little about XRP you also know about XLM but what about number going up?  Is it all mere speculation on the fact that Ripple will defeat the SEC in its lawsuit or is it because the banking crisis is providing a legitimate use case to both projects as it comes to remittances, payments and banking efficiency and transparency. I honestly do not have the answer so I came to this sub to find out some opinions and thoughts. 

What I do know is that if the SEC loses to Ripple then XRP might go parabolic as the entire US market will then have access to it. News flash. Coinbase has announced re listing XRP in the near future. This could be bullish AF for Ripple but its all TBD. Where do you think all this goes? Do XRP and XLM have a bright future ahead?",60,2023-04-02 16:45:21,140
XRP,cryptocurrency,I lost 650k from last bull run.,"I been in crypto since 2017. I got into it during the top back then. Was just a poor college grad, so I didn't have much to lose. Luckily  as crypto crashed in 2018 I landed a nice paying job. I was putting 90% of my pay check into crypto up until mid 2020. Buying btc at 3k and eth sub 100. I bought Chainlink at 30 cents. A few other good entries too. Sadly I also had a big portion of my shitfolio in XRP, but tbf it had some fair returns in 2021. 

I sold my portfolio in Feb 2021, a bit too early. And as you guessed, everything ran up 2-3 X higher after I sold. I told myself I wouldn't look back. And that we were entering a long bear market. I had about 700k at that time. All of it put into Anchorrrrr. Quit the job too like a fool. And as you already know 2021 was a double bubble. 

Later, in November that year btc reached new ath's, followed by a correction. I thought a major alt season was on the rise. ""I just need a 2x to make up for what I missed out on."" I still remember that one night, at the intersection in my car at a red light. It was midnight and I was the only one there. Looked at my phone and saw -50% across the entire crypto market.  It was all downhill from there.

Not everyone wins. In order for you to win, someone must lose. Who here is from the 2017 era still hasn't ""made it""? Am I the only one? Like a child held back a grade? I'm still here, it was painful. My portfolio was near Ath's recently, but not quite. The bull isn't exactly guaranteed. I been learning TA for the past few years and listening about how the markets work. But I'm still here, for now.",1031,2024-05-20 02:54:07,769

XRP,cryptocurrency,Ripple (XRP) is a different animal compared to other cryptos,"Since XRP is quite old by today's standards, many people believe and trade it like any other crypto. But XRP has a complete different approach to the technology and should be therefore also treated differently.

Ripple is not only a chain, but has a for profit corporation behind it. Its business model is based on fiat to fiat money transfer with XRP as an intermediate token. For this to properly work the price of the coin is irrelevant, but its liquidity is important. To achieve this, the Ripple Corporation can mint and burn XRP on it own as they seem fit.

People buying just the token are just getting the excess the corporation does not use anymore. On the other hand, the Ripple Corporation is directly funded through these sales. But once they are sold, they have no value to the business model. They don't need to buy some for liquidity, they can just mint some more. To be more clear, by buying XRP one does not participate in the success of Ripple just funding their operations. Quite some one sided business.

To answer some obvious questions: the time frame for the fiat to fiat transfer is short enough, so that price changes for XRP are irrelevant. Blockchain technology is used for having a ledger that holds all transactions in a simple and seamless way. It is also obvious that the corporation has no interest in decentralization or development of its chain technology. Naturaly, its business model creates some serious volume on the chain which may make it look like being ""legit"".

If do not want to fund this corporation without benefits, then you probably don't want to trade XRP.",0,2024-07-17 19:54:31,49

XRP,cryptocurrency,Did anyone else find it suspicious that XRP and ETH were omitted from the recent SEC charges against Binance.US?,"I strongly believe that the omission was a deliberate act, suggesting that there may be an ongoing connection between the Ripple lawsuit and other events occurring this month. One of these events is the scheduled release of the Hinman emails by the SEC on June 13th, as mandated by the judge. It's important to note that this date holds significance, as it marks exactly 4 years and 364 days since the well-known Hinman speech. This delay in disclosing the documents by the SEC appears intentional, as it was expected that the judge would eventually approve their unsealing.

While I'm not well-versed in the intricacies of the law, I suspect that there may be a time limit for filing lawsuits, possibly within 5 years of a specific event. This would mean that any potential plaintiffs would have only one day to file their lawsuits after the Hinman emails are disclosed. Logistically speaking, it would be nearly impossible to prepare and file such a claim on such short notice.

In my opinion, there are some dubious circumstances surrounding this situation. It's conceivable that the SEC and XRP have already reached a confidential settlement and are waiting for these events to transpire before making a public announcement.  


I also hold the belief that Ethereum may encounter regulatory challenges in the future, considering the upcoming disclosure of emails and the 5-year milestone, protecting the Hinman speech of any lawsuits. These events might provide conflicting information regarding the regulatory position the SEC holds regarding ETH.

I find it difficult to fully comprehend the implications of these particular events taking place next week as I do not trust the SEC at all. It's uncertain whether they could potentially result in a significant unforeseen ""black swan"" event for ETH holders or it could be nothing at all and I am just overthinking the situation.",42,2023-06-09 08:29:29,124

They used this to dump on investors and used the money to build Ripple, the physical company.

Then, after most of this original community and investors capitulate, they announce a buyback, times with a BTC rally and they pump the price, causing another retail FOMO and gains of like 100% in a week.

How the fuck is this legal?
Btw, full disclosure, I have XRP holdings and I am in profit, even though it's a total shitcoin, I knew it would pump. The number go up was obvious, so despite my distaste for XRP, I like making money. So this post doesn't come from some angry XRP Army moron who capitulated last month.

I genuinely just think this type of market practice is unethical and should be highlighted to the community.

XRP,cryptocurrency,Ripple is funding propaganda against Bitcoin by teaming up with the government to spread energy FUD,"Ripple labs has been funding ""research"" along with government entities to spread propaganda against Bitcoin and mining. 

In 2021, they funded a hit piece that claims energy prices for consumers in New York has increased by $6 per month because of mining. 

[Claim: Mining drives up household electricity bills](https://preview.redd.it/m0ta2tae4xb81.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=8079d16b0fde7bc74ebd204d4362ff823da26d3f)

Surely its not the soaring costs of natural gas that is driving up electricity prices, but mining? 

[Since June 2020, Natural gas prices have gone up by 350&#37; in the USA \(Henry Hub natural gas futures rolling contracts\)](https://preview.redd.it/iprxvhfj5xb81.jpg?width=2610&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4da2516b82eb585706d4d1af417320b5b82889e)

[Not just in USA, in UK, natural gas is at decadal highs. ](https://preview.redd.it/v2gl6rmx3xb81.jpg?width=3094&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dae03fee6dfbbfaf58df82519db809462d01254)

Surely, electricity prices that consumers pay have nothing whatsoever to do with inflation, or soaring gas prices that are in decadal highs.. but is due to bitcoin mining?!

Crude oil WTI futures are currently at 84, for comparison it was around 56 in Nov 2019 (pre pandemic). The last time WTI was above 80 was all the way back in 2014. Increasing crude oil natural gas prices, along with inflation that is at multi-decade high is not the reason for increase in household electricity, but its bitcoin mining that is responsible.. 

[Thats according to this study funded by Ripple in collusion with the Department of Treasury. ](https://preview.redd.it/a4z5aqnyaxb81.jpg?width=1944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6656489541bece07a0e9b83837d42345157f987c)... The same Department of Treasury headed by another well known Bitcoin hater Janet Yellen, who earned $7m as ""speaking fee"" from the same banks she is supposed to regulate but has tried to stifle Bitcoin and crypto at every opportunity. 

Research with ""financial support"" is nothing but propaganda, especially when it's funded by a competitor to bitcoin that lobbies with the government. Ripple continues to be a centralised premine scam created to enrich its founders. 

Ripple has also cozied up with the likes of WEF, the very organisations Bitcoin was created as a fuck you to. [https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple](https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple)

As its price and narrative around the shitcoin has stagnated, Ripple is resorting to dirty political tricks to get a leg up. As usual, they will fail. 

The narrative that bitcoin mining companies cause increase in electricity bills in NY is rubbish, as the largest BTC mining companies in New York produce their own energy. Infact the last one to start mining in NY is a hydro electric plant that was unused for years, before they started mining Bitcoin last year. 

[https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php)

The other large mining company Greenidge Generation also produces its own energy.


Edit: Buttcoin losers in comments say ""reee bitcoin move to POS or govt will ban it""

Yeah not too bright, the whole point of Bitcoin is that it cant be banned unlike the proof of stake shitcoins you support that can be created out of thin air at the press of a button and shut down at the press of a button.

Another one who is literally a war monger calling for Ukraine invasion but pretends to care about global e-waste. Lmao. Bitcoin haters are really a funny bunch


Edit: Ripple shills keep brigading and claiming where is the paper, of course if you are as bricked as a ripple fan boy you need to be spoon fed everything. Well here is the paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779720

And if you open up the first page of it, says

> **Benetton and Compiani acknowledge financial support from Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative.**

i.e this whole ""paper"" is nothing but a hit piece propaganda sponsored by a competitor

The other writer of this paper is Adiar Morse, who conveniently works for the Dept of Treasury under Yellen: 

https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/prof-adair-morse-joins-biden-administration-as-a-treasury-department-deputy/

Seems like natural career progression - collect funds from Ripple to publish propaganda against Bitcoin, and get hired by Yellen who has been promoting propaganda against crypto for years now. Nothing to see here.

Final Edit: Jjust look at the number of freshly created ""Tin"" accounts that have popped up in the comments to shill for XRP. Didnt realize 2017 left so many bag holders. It must be real miserable with these heavy bags that are at 1/3rd of their 2017 ATH, while almost every other coin has gone up hundreds of % and made new highs this cycle. Thats what happens when you become exit liquidity for mccaleb, garlinghouse etc. 

Lol at the shills shouting ""REEE ripple is a company XRP is decentralised token"". They really did you good with this one small trick. 
Thats also the reason garlinhouse drives a shiny car while you are down 50% on your shitcoin investment. 

The D in XRP stands for decentralised. It was always a premined scam token and will always be one. Thousands of tin bagholders wont change this.",3881,2022-01-15 22:15:00,2655

Dip is one thing, crash and bear is another. And it can last for a long period of time.

\- Investors are losing confidence in the market

\- Prices are decreasing for possibly longer period of time

\- Negative talk of cryptocurrency in news, social media, mainstream media and so on

In the recent hearing, the judge rejected the SEC’s motion to prevent Ripple from pursuing a fair notice defense.

Well, this has sent the [XRP price up](https://swapzone.io/currencies/ripple?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) 12% which is currently trading at $0.81 with a market cap of $39.1 billion. Although XRP continues to remain volatile with the broader market correction, today’s move helps its cover all of its last month’s loss.

Ripple CEO wrote: “While we would have preferred the cases against Chris and me to end now, the SEC must now prove its claims. We are confident that ultimately all of them will be dismissed”.

This could probably mean that the Ripple vs SEC is close enough to its conclusion.

XRP,cryptocurrency,Warning: don't buy the 99.99% dip,"The way the algorithm works for the mechanism means you can trade UST for equal value of LUNA. So the simple version is that when someone sells one UST for $0.40 then it creates another 400 LUNA if the price is at $0.001 per LUNA. And if the price is $0.0001 it will create another 4000 LUNA from that one UST.

&#x200B;

So it might seem like a great deal and that you are buying the dip 99.99% down but the amount of coins is growing massively too. You can check their API here (link from coingecko)[https://fcd.terra.dev/v1/circulatingsupply/lunaCirculating](https://fcd.terra.dev/v1/circulatingsupply/lunaCirculating) supply is now over 150 billion according to their API. over 3\* as many as XRP. This will go to SHIB levels as that previously $13 billion of UST unlocks itself.

&#x200B;

Anyway just a word of caution not to buy the dip becuase it will continue to dilute massively. I already lost some money myself buying the dip until I released how the minting mechanism works.

As the title says, I'm in a position right now to think it could be in my best interest long-term to sell XRP, LTC and DOGE (though I'll lose around 200 usd right now) but I fear they might not go back up and in the long run lose both the profit from them and the possible profit from turning them into BTC (as it will more than likely go up and up).

So basically, which do you think is the best strategy? 

a) sell the altcoins, lose 200 usd right now, have a change to have a bigger profit from BTC

b)keep the altcoins, HODL right now, maybe the coins don't bounce back up and make less profit from BTC in the long run.

What would you do?  Please, let me know.

Thank you and happy trading!",74,2021-08-10 11:39:02,234

XRP,cryptocurrency,XRP sent to newly created wallet while I was asleep. Can’t figure out how they got to it.,"Lost my XRP off Trust Wallet. Never connected with xrpl to any site (happened while I slept)

I will try to explain why this is unusual. I know plenty of people fall victim to scams and live in denial of how they lost their money so easily. 

Hear me out, 

The EVM wallet associated with the “multi-coin wallet” on trust had been used for three years. I have connected with that wallet on metamask with other sites and dapps (I had cleared the connections through metamask many times, but I’m sure there were dapps connected at the time). 

Never had funds been stolen/wiped out of this evm wallet. I imported this wallet from metamask to trust wallet a while ago and then, recently, created an xrpl wallet with Trust wallet on the same wallet. (It was imported as a multicoin wallet). 

No funds were moved for a few days. I even left 100 xrp for one week before withdrawing as I needed the cash. I was certain this wallet was secure. I had not connected any sites however I had never cleared. I also stored my seed phrase in notes on iPhone. This whole thing has me paranoid so I wiped my phone completely (factory Reset). Idk how it could happen I’m just glad it was only 200 XRP. 

Can someone help me secure this and figure out the breach point?

Then the same with XRP. I had friends calling me about it and asking advice and I told them exactly what I thought was going on, which transpired to be the case.  Lucky they took my advice and held off. 

There’s been a significant rise in new accounts shilling these days and it’s our responsibility to help ease new investors into the space. It’s frustrating watching the endless shill.

Brandon Biggs (""Last Days"" on YouTube) posted a video 3 months describing a vision God showed him of Trump's ear getting shot during an assassination attempt. The prophetic video has been shared across social media and major networks such as CNN. Brandon's channel views are increasing by 10's of thousands each day. A month ago, Brandon mentions a vision God showed him about the economy and the rise of XRP / Ripple. Since the video, XRP has risen over 40% and continues to climb. XRP was at $0.40 at the time of the video and is $0.61 at the time of this post. The current all time high for XRP is $3.84 though the prophet mentions $5 in some videos.

The new information corrects the misleading media narrative that the SEC’s meetings are solely about Ripple.

","In a recent episode of the World Class podcast with host Chris Vasquez, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed concern about potential repercussions if the US takes action against Tether, a prominent stablecoin issuer. Garlinghouse highlighted Tether’s significance within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, emphasizing uncertainty regarding the broader impact of such actions. 

This comes amid growing concerns over the use of USDT by sanctioned nations and terrorist groups to bypass US financial restrictions, with US Treasury Deputy Secretary Adewale Adeyemo shedding light on Russia’s reliance on alternative payment methods like Tether’s USDT. Additionally, banking giant Deutsche Bank has raised questions about Tether’s operations, casting doubt on the stability of the stablecoin market.

XRP,CryptoMarkets,Crypto vs Banks: Chainlink and Ripple are Taking No Sides,"When Satoshi created Bitcoin in 2009, the idea was to decentralise financial transactions -  since banks are controlled by the financial authorities. A few years later, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies became more popular, and there’s now a great debate about which is better between crypto and banks.   
  
But two of the largest blockchains, Ripple and Chainlink, are taking no sides in this debate. Both blockchains are working with banks and other financial institutions to build what may become a solid financial infrastructure for the future.   
  
After its recent partial victory against the SEC, Ripple CTO, David Schwartz, has said the company is back to building a system that enables global financial institutions to “move, manage, and tokenize value.” Supporters are also hopeful that banks will start adopting XRP for cross-border transactions.   
  
On the other hand, Chainlink recently announced that it’s partnering with Swift, an interbank messaging platform, to build an on-chain token transfer system via Chainlink’s protocol. On top of that, Swift recently tested a new connection between blockchain technology and over 12 financial institutions using Chainlink’s protocol.   
  
Evidently, there is more push for a hybrid financial system combining crypto and traditional finance in some quarters of the crypto ecosystem. Is this the next big step towards better crypto adoption, or is it more of an experiment? Let’s have some thoughts below.",2,2023-10-05 09:59:07,10

XRP,CryptoMarkets,Let’s talk Ripple / XRP for a minute..,"Now before you skip the text below and immediately go on a tantrum, realize I have a diverse portfolio and  understand very well why people go for other projects than Ripple.

However..

The sheer stupidity on here sometimes is mind blowing.

There’s a ton of people on the crypto subs who completely fail to realize that with 99% of the current projects, you’re betting your money on a company’s potential based on their ‘white paper and team’. That’s it. Calling most of them a company would be a huge overstatement too.

Not investing in XRP because “companies won’t use the token” is so naive that it causes me physical pain to read.

Again, you’re betting on potential.

How could you possibly think a group of random teenagers with no social or business skills and experience creating yet another ERC20 token that has no use has more potential than XRP? A US based company with an amazing team and investors and partners that go far beyond most blockchain companies will probably ever work with?

Like I’ve said, I understand why you’d rather bet on Ethereum, Bitcoin even and a few others here and there.

But honestly stop acting like a damn parrot. The only reason you’re constantly repeating the “ThEy WoNt UsE XRP!!!” argument is because you’ve seen someone else say it and you want to come across as knowledgeable.

Chances are you’ve read that, accepted it as the absolute truth and left it there without doing even a shred of further research. Yet fall for the constant shilling of random coins every single day, driving you insane.

The whole crypto space is in its infancy stage but Ripple is laying a solid ground for an amazing future. They’re among a handful of others, tops. If you’re in 10-15+ coins you’re going to go home disappointed, because the hits most of your “investments” took will shatter any profit you’ve made from the minority of your portfolio.

If you actually care about arguments for investing in XRP and genuinely want to make money with your investments instead of your gambling based on short term satisfaction, read articles like the ones below:

Bitso, a leading cryptocurrency exchange in Latin America, has utilized Ripple's ODL product to facilitate more than $3.3 billion in transactions between the US and Mexico in 2022. This partnership demonstrates the institutional adoption of cryptocurrency for cross-border payment solutions and highlights the utility of blockchain technology and crypto in the financial sector.",14,2023-04-30 03:59:12,1

But now I don't see how anything could happen with it. It was supposed to go up after the SEC case and instead went down. It can't even go back to it's peak at 3 dollars yet alone 10 dollars like some claim. Before the case it was the same. Seems like the more ""banks"" utilize it the lower the price is.

XRP,CryptoMarkets,Quick question about selling XRP on Binance during a price spike,"Hey everyone, I have a hypothetical scenario I'd like some clarity on:

Let's say I'm holding some XRP on Binance, and the current price is $0.56 USD. Suddenly, in just a couple of days, the market goes crazy and XRP shoots up to $100 per coin.

1. To take advantage of this situation, is it enough to simply convert my XRP to USDT on Binance?
2. Is there anything else I should be aware of or do to secure my profits in this scenario?
3. Are there any potential issues or risks I should watch out for when trying to sell during such a dramatic price increase?

I'm fairly new to crypto trading, so any advice or insights would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!",1,2024-09-27 12:03:12,27

XRP,CryptoMarkets,Market Behavior XRP and TRX,"Hello! I've recently noticed an interesting pattern in the market. Before the latest altcoin dump, XRP experienced a pump, and this isn’t the first time I’ve seen this. It seems like when XRP pumps, it pulls a lot from the market cap, which then leads to other altcoins dropping. I read somewhere that after an XRP pump, alts tend to dump, but after a TRX pump, alts actually pump too. Could this be due to their blockchain roles and ecosystems? For instance, XRP is increasingly used by banks and its huge supply, while TRX powers the TRC-20 network, where it’s widely used for transactions. Does anyone have insights into why XRP and TRX seem to impact the market so differently?",4,2024-11-14 18:24:15,2

XRP,CryptoMarkets,Man who prophesied Trump's ear being shot mentions XRP Ripple,"[https://youtu.be/5KMTvwdPp8o?si=DxscL8ojzHppG3HC&t=485](https://youtu.be/5KMTvwdPp8o?si=DxscL8ojzHppG3HC&t=485)

Brandon Biggs (""Last Days"" on YouTube) posted a video 3 months describing a vision God showed him of Trump's ear getting shot during an assassination attempt. The prophetic video has been shared across social media and major networks such as CNN. Brandon's channel views are increasing by 10's of thousands each day. A month ago, Brandon mentions a vision God showed him about the economy and the rise of XRP / Ripple. Since the video, XRP has risen over 40% and continues to climb. XRP was at $0.40 at the time of the video and is $0.61 at the time of this post. The current all time high for XRP is $3.84 though the prophet mentions $5 in some videos.

XRP,CryptoMarkets,John Deaton Interview about the XRP SEC Lawsuit,"Link to interview:  [interview](https://youtu.be/3FCe-3L_peA)


John Deaton discusses his path from crypto investor to being the face of the XRP SEC lawsuit.  

In the interview he covers the best case scenario for the lawsuit and what would need to happen to lead to a settlement and possible time lines.  He also covers the unlikely worst case scenario of the judge finding XRP as a security and what that would mean for Ripple as a company and the potential fallout for the XRP coin.  He believes in this scenario a decision could come sometime in July or August.  In this scenario XRP may only be sold to accredited investors and be removed from all exchanges permanently.  They also discuss how this could lead to an XRP buyback and what that would mean for the XRPLedger.

They also cover China banning crypto and trying to implement their own CBDC as well as the news of potential Russian regulation of crypto and crypto mining.  How US politicians may respond in the coming weeks, including the upcoming executive order.  

Scams, securities, and transparency in the crypto space are also covered and how the decision can impact the entire crypto space going forward.

XRP,CryptoMarkets,SEC claims the US govt has jurisdiction over all Ethereum network transactions now that ETH has transitioned to proof-of-stake & the majority of nodes being run are in the US. Do you think the SEC might eventually sue ETH like it did XRP for unlawfully issuing securities?,"Ethereum \[ETH\] has been one of the most-talked about cryptocurrencies over the past few weeks, with major updates like the Merge taking place. Apart from this, the network’s transition into proof-of-stake \[PoS\] has been fueling rumors about ETH being categorized as a security. Now, further strengthening this argument, the SEC in a lawsuit against crypto influencer Ian Balina claimed that ETH transactions automatically fall under the US government’s jurisdiction due to the majority of nodes being run in the country.

Balina was sued for allegedly offering unregistered tokens. He was caught in trouble after he failed to register his project as a security before rolling out an initial coin offering \[ICO\] in 2018. The crypto influencer outrightly denied these claims. However, the crypto community is currently speculating on SEC’s massive statement in the lawsuit. According to the 69th paragraph, the lawsuit stated that it had the right to sue Balina because the SEC had jurisdiction over the Ethereum network.

It was reported that a variety of U.S.-based investors participated in the Balina-curated investment pool. A network of Ethereum blockchain nodes further verified a number of ETH contributions. Due to this, the SEC stated,

“ETH contributors were validated by a network of nodes on the Ethereum blockchain, which are clustered more densely in the United States than in any other country. As a result, those transactions took place in the United States.”

Additionally, it should be noted that at present 42.56 percent or 3340 of the 7819 Ethereum nodes reside in the US.

**Will this statement take a toll on the Ethereum network?**

The Ethereum network has been dealing with immense backlash following the Merge. As mentioned earlier, some were suggesting that the network would fall under the SEC’s purview as it would now be considered a security. A few others on the other hand were taking digs at ETH’s level of decentralization.

Amidst all of this, the latest statement made by the SEC would be detrimental to the network. Even though several legal professionals noted that the complaint’s phrasing would have no legal significance, it would nevertheless be noticed.",42,2022-09-20 13:30:21,36

XRP,CryptoMarkets,Let’s talk Ripple / XRP for a minute..,"Now before you skip the text below and immediately go on a tantrum, realize I have a diverse portfolio and  understand very well why people go for other projects than Ripple.

However..

The sheer stupidity on here sometimes is mind blowing.

There’s a ton of people on the crypto subs who completely fail to realize that with 99% of the current projects, you’re betting your money on a company’s potential based on their ‘white paper and team’. That’s it. Calling most of them a company would be a huge overstatement too.

Not investing in XRP because “companies won’t use the token” is so naive that it causes me physical pain to read.

Again, you’re betting on potential.

How could you possibly think a group of random teenagers with no social or business skills and experience creating yet another ERC20 token that has no use has more potential than XRP? A US based company with an amazing team and investors and partners that go far beyond most blockchain companies will probably ever work with?

Like I’ve said, I understand why you’d rather bet on Ethereum, Bitcoin even and a few others here and there.

But honestly stop acting like a damn parrot. The only reason you’re constantly repeating the “ThEy WoNt UsE XRP!!!” argument is because you’ve seen someone else say it and you want to come across as knowledgeable.

Chances are you’ve read that, accepted it as the absolute truth and left it there without doing even a shred of further research. Yet fall for the constant shilling of random coins every single day, driving you insane.

The whole crypto space is in its infancy stage but Ripple is laying a solid ground for an amazing future. They’re among a handful of others, tops. If you’re in 10-15+ coins you’re going to go home disappointed, because the hits most of your “investments” took will shatter any profit you’ve made from the minority of your portfolio.

If you actually care about arguments for investing in XRP and genuinely want to make money with your investments instead of your gambling based on short term satisfaction, read articles like the ones below:

XRP,Bitcoin,"Permissioned ledgers and closed, centralized blockchains such as Eris, Hyperledger, Ripple etc., rely on trust and central key holders. They stifle innovation. This quote by Andreas Antonopolus is perfect in response to the permissioned blockchain argument.","“If you look around at all the financial institutions and systems we have in society; the systems that provide trust rely on central actors. They require an organization or person, a key holder, an authority to sit at the center and provide trust for the network. And bitcoin has no center and bitcoin has no authority and bitcoin has no trusted party. And that’s important because it changes things in a couple major ways. 

You see, when you have a network where trust depends on a central authority, you have to be very careful who you give access to. Traditional financial systems depend on access control. That means that you can only trust once you vet someone, and you can only allow access to the network once you’ve vetted and trusted them. Essentially when you have an access control based system of trust, you have to trust everyone who has access, and that means very few people can have access to the network. That’s why I can’t connect to the Visa network programmatically, unless I’m properly vetted as a merchant. That’s why I can’t use the MasterCard network or the SWIFT banking network to send money from my PC. Because I cannot be trusted, and they need to trust everyone who’s on the network, because that’s how their trust model works. 

So, trust based on everyone who access so very few people have access. Bitcoin uses trust though computation. It uses trust through a mathematical algorithm. And trust through computation means that you trust no one, and everyone can have access. So whereas in a traditional system you have to trust everyone who has access so very few people can have access, in bitcoin you trust *no one* and *everyone is welcome to join*. And that is a radical and revolutionary technological system. Because that creates an open network. 
We’re using an open network: the internet. The internet is a system of open access based on common standards and conventions. A network where you do not need permission to communicate, you do not need permission to access, and most importantly, you do not need permission to *innovate* on the network. You can write an application, connect it on the edge of the network and launch it on the network. *Innovation without permission*. Bitcoin allows you to do that for money. 

When’s the last time you saw someone build a bank out of their garage, and disrupt the financial services system to its core? Never. Why? Because they’re not given access, because access has to be trusted. On bitcoin anyone can create an application, and can innovate, and create new financial instruments. And that is pretty radical. 

So you don’t need to trust everyone on bitcoin because you can trust the mathematical algorithm at the center of it. And you don’t really need to understand that to use bitcoin.”

XRP,Bitcoin,Why is Ripple so disliked/controversial?,"I recently found out about Ripple, and was curious what to hear what /r/bitcoin thought about it.  Going through past posts, it seems like most people here dislike it/think it is a scam.  I am not sure why, as it seems like a complementary tool with a lot of potential.  

It seems like the main criticisms I have seen are as follows:

1.  It seems like a scam, since OpenCoin is keeping many of the XRP: This sounds like a growing pains issue, and the company is holding onto them incase and new issues arise.  Considering some of the crashes and forks that have come up with Bitcoin, I don't think it's a bad idea to be prepared for this.

2.  XRP is just another alt-currency: I don't understand this one either.  XRP is more of a postage stamp used to facilitate transactions (I know that's quoting the ripple webpage, but it's still a good definition).  True, postage stamps can be used as a currency (as they are in many prisons where money and cigarettes are not allowed), but it seems to function much better at facilitating transactions with bitcoins.  

3.  It is fueled by debt.  While I don't fully understand the IOU system and how it works, it's not the huge speculation many people portray it to be.  This seems to come down to most people not understand how it works, and criticizing it as a result.

I am still very new to this concept, and would appreciate and other viewpoints this subreddit can contribute.  ",16,2013-06-09 03:54:49,136

XRP,Bitcoin,"I used to support the idea of ""decentralized exchanges"" and Ripple until...","I realized how important the decentralized nature of Bitcoin is.  How trustless payments are more important than a trust-based fiat gateway system.  Decentralized exchanges do not mitigate risk they only shift the risk from the exchange to the gateway.  There is nothing fundamentally better about a decentralized exchange because the gateways are still central points of failure.  And the IOUs that you are trading can be debased and/or become completely worthless in the failure of said issuer.

In fact, the very concept of a ""decentralized exchange"" is bullshit.  You can exchange IOUs all you want, but at some point, you need to go through a gateway which is a centralized risk.

This article enlightened me quite a bit: http://thethug.life/no-blockchain-for-you/  

This is when I realized that Ripple is completely unnecessary.  There's no point in trading a bunch of digital IOUs that require third party trust and have few gateways which can fail at any time.

You can trade gold IOUs all you want on Ripple, but there's no guarantee those companies won't go out of business and aren't legit in the first place.  

This is not an anti-Ripple post.  This is just a mere statement that the 'regulatory' compliance issue will add the regular burdens and basically there is no need for a decentralized ledger of IOUs that may or may not be fake in the first place.

Here is the basic gist of why we don't need Ripple and a centralized statist network.  

**IOUs can be forged and debased.**

*Ripple Labs funded a bunch of XRP gateways to try and convince people this is a useful system - but it's not.  The only IOUs that anyone trades are pump and dumps.  Nobody wants to own digital gold on the Ripple network and trade it at the speed of a snail.*

It's a technological project whose success means total political and economic revolution.

I see two major camps here. In the first camp are the folks attracted to 'quick money', they are excited for Bitcoin and hope to time the market, making a quick 5-10x. These are the folks that you see selling right now. You can't blame them, these folks are making (in many cases) life changing money, paying down/off cars, houses, etc.
  
The second camp are what I consider to be the true believers. Those of us that understand that Bitcoin has the potential to change money forever. If you believe that a decentralized digital currency, free from government corruption and controlled by the masses is the future - then you're in this camp. This is no easy road, there are going to be sell-offs, attempted regulation, and major unforeseen disasters. It's not for the faint of heart. We could and probably will lose everything, but IF we pull this off, the results will be unlike anything we've ever seen.

I'm printing out my wallets and putting them into cold storage. This sell-off (for me) doesn't matter, is all part of the long bumpy road we must travel. For better or worse I'm in this for the long haul.

XRP,Bitcoin,Andreas Antonopoulos' depiction of the day he became aware of the donations that made him a millionaire,"*I'm not sure if this already has been posted here, but I just came across this post from [A. Antonopoulos' Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/aantonop/posts) (it's a public entry posted on 16th of December. The readability and formatting is better there btw):*

*Edit: direct link to the post: https://www.patreon.com/posts/emotional-15912702*  

----------------  




On December 6th, my life changed trajectory... again. I went to sleep on a wave of positive messages and support from the bitcoin community, in response to a letter I had posted on Patreon titled “In defense of optimism” that had leaked to Reddit.
I had spent the day reading messages of support pouring in on Twitter, Patreon, and email, literally thousands of them. It was a life-affirming experience. Like everyone else on social media, the messages I receive are not always kind and supportive. Often the critical messages and trolls are far louder than the supporters. Our brains don't evaluate praise and criticism in equal measure - it's easy to believe the criticism and see the praise as undeserved. That’s why each little message of support makes a difference, each one helps me ignore the critics and see the impact of my work. In addition to all of the written messages, people were signing up to support me on Patreon and some were even sending bitcoin to my donation address. By the time I went to sleep, I was filled with gratitude, humbled by the overwhelmingly positive, viral response of the community. 

Here’s what happened next...

I wake up on December 7th, the notifications list on my phone was too long to scroll. Hundreds more messages of support had come in while I was asleep.

Then my phone rings and I recognize the number of a dear friend. ""Strange,"" I think. I’m not expecting a call. ""Don't open your laptop yet,"" she says. ""You got some big bitcoin donations overnight. Are you sitting down?"" I sit down. I open my laptop, I look at the balance in my 1andreas bitcoin donation address.

Surprise, gratitude, fear, shock, joy, elation, anxiety. My emotions achieved a level of volatility that mirrored that of the bitcoin exchange rate. Good thing I was sitting down.

You're probably thinking that between the supportive messages and the large donations, I’d have been celebrating without a care in the world. But I'm a security professional who works in bitcoin. Could I come up with a doomsday scenario to taint this experience? Hold my beer.

I'm in a taxi on the way to the airport. I’m cycling through emotions again, a bit faster now.

Joy, Terror, Tears, Gratitude, Fear, Elation, Dread, Cold Sweat. It's a good thing I'm sitting down. I can't feel my fingers.

Anxiety

Wouldn't it be ironic if I get hacked and this massive donation is stolen the same day it was given? *Shudder*. That was a real possibility. Funds were sent to a vanity address, posted on my website, which was mainly used to support my habit of giving small amounts of bitcoin to strangers at meetups and conferences. Before December 6th, the address typically received small gifts each month and I emptied it every now and then in a spree of small donations. 

Gratitude

I still can’t believe how many people have responded. I had no idea how many people could identify with the feelings expressed “In defense of optimism” and would want to show their support. I’m grateful to be a part of this community.

Fear 

This vanity address is secured with a single private key which was stored on my phone in a “hot” wallet, so that I can give away bitcoin at meetups. The address has maximum public visibility and no Segwit (segregated witness) support. My security model just tipped over and I'm freaking out.

Happiness

I’m so happy! This is incredible, unimaginable. My fingers are numb, in a good way. Is this really happening?!?

Cold Sweats

I have to move the funds out. Now. Right now. But I only have this key on a wallet that doesn't handle RBF (replace-by-fee), CPFP (child-pays-for-parent), and it's not a Segwit address. I'm traveling; I’m about to get on two long flights and the mempool is slammed with transactions. Of all the days!

Joy

I’m crying. Tears of joy. This is something most people never get to experience in the most meaningful of careers, a loud acknowledgement from an entire community and financial security. I’m thinking about my family members and close friends who are struggling and overjoyed at the opportunity I now have to help them. 

Terror

Then it dawns on me: a perfect nightmare scenario. What if this is considered ""income"" in the US and I have to pay taxes at a 39.6% rate? Those taxes would be evaluated on the USD value of the donation at the time it was made, at an all-time-high price of bitcoin. If bitcoin's bubble bursts by 50% today, I will owe more taxes than the donation is worth. I will be bankrupt but will owe the IRS and those debts can't be discharged in bankruptcy. I'm going to be in debt for a decade!

Elation

I can HODL! I don’t have to keep selling to pay bills. Patreon has grown too, so I should be able to cover my expenses and build the business with their support. I can really HODL!

[Alarm buzzes on my phone]

“Boarding on Gate D15”. Pack everything back up, run to the gate. Find my seat. Unpack all my electronics. Re-establish connections. No Wifi yet. 3G if I hold my phone just so against the window. We're taking off. No Wifi at all on this flight. 4 hours, offline, me and my thoughts. What is the opposite of a state of mindfulness? Head spinning.

Fear

What if the price crashes. Should I sell some?

Silliness

I'm buying a lambo (I laugh out loud at the thought of that. No, I'd never waste money on something so silly).

Dread

What if the donations had zero fees and will never confirm? What if this was all a cruel joke? 

Joy

My dad will be so proud!

[Landed]

Turn on smartphone. Too many notifications. Turn on VPN, Tor. Sync wallet. Too slow. Too slow.

Run to the lounge. Get on Wifi. Fire up VPN, Tor. Start electrum. Import keys. Child-pays-for-parent the stuck transactions, Replace-by-fee new transactions. Careful coin selection. Send to cold storage (so glad I keep an unused cold storage address handy). Overpay fees more than ever before. 2000 satoshi per byte? Fuck yeah. This is the highest priority transaction of my life. 8 agonizing minutes. 1st block. Confirmations ripple down my screen. Exhaling... I hadn't noticed I was holding my breath.

“Boarding gate C51”. Pack everything, run to the gate. Board the plane. Unpack everything. This flight has Wifi. Bet it doesn't work. Yup, it doesn't work. 6.5 hour flight. I'll just read a book. I've read the same paragraph 8 times and don't know what it says. I'll sleep. Nope. Ok fine, I'll fret - seems I'm good at that and nothing else right now.

[Landed]

That was the longest flight ever. Boot up, 4G, VPN, Tor. Sync.... slow, too slow.

ANOTHER GIANT DONATION. WTF! Is this really happening? Is my wallet counting the balance incorrectly? This isn't possible. WTF IS GOING ON?

Joy, Terror, Tears, Gratitude, Fear, Elation, Dread. I’m cycling faster now.

I just emptied my wallet into cold storage and now it's carrying a ridiculous amount again. Boot up, VPN, Tor, Electrum, CPFP, RBF, cold sweat, 1 confirmation. Phew.

I realize that I just conducted the 4 biggest transactions of my life. I'm shaking. Hope I didn't screw anything up.

Finally I get to my hotel. “Long day” doesn’t even begin to describe it. I am grateful, giddy, jetlagged and exhausted, so sleep should come easy, right? Not happening. Two hours of tossing and turning while my mind is racing. In the end I just pass out from exhaustion. I wake up in a state of anxiety. 

I open my inbox. I have a dozen interview requests from newspapers, TV, radio. They don’t want to talk about bitcoin. They want to talk about “my story.” It’s never been about “my story” and I’m not about to change that. Denied, denied, denied. That’s it. I’m going offline for a few days. I need time to process everything that has happened over the past couple of days and strategize about what to do next.

There are no words to adequately convey my appreciation, my gratitude. 

These are life-changing gifts, but I don’t intend to change my life. I’m highly suspicious and careful about “lifestyle inflation”: I resist any urges to increase my spending as my income increases because as a self-employed entrepreneur I know my income can decrease significantly at any moment. 

First, the practical side: For legal and tax reasons the gifts should remain mostly untouched for at least three years. This is a new situation and no one knows for sure how the authorities will characterize it. I wanted to HODL anyway, so that’s fine with me.

Second, and the much more important side, I love what I do. I’m obviously not going to “retire” or slow down. Receiving your messages and support has energized me and I’m excited to do more, much more. 

The number of people supporting me on Patreon has grown significantly and with that support I’ll actually be able to do a lot more. And there are many things I want to do:  a new website with more materials, in as many formats and languages as possible; more books; an epic tour; and that’s just the beginning!  I also plan to grow my team, which serves two goals: I can get help for the things that need to be done, but I can also bring more people success and security with a steady paycheck.

While I’m excited about all of these new projects, I want you to know that the ultimate goal remains the same: to educate as many people as possible about this transformational technology and remain an independent voice, working directly for the community. 

A week has passed. The one feeling that keeps returning, among the barrage of feelings, is gratitude. After taking time to process and calm down, the fear and stress is gone and all that is left is gratitude. I am so thankful for all the messages of support. I am so touched to hear stories of how my work has affected others in a positive way. I am thankful for all the donors who rallied behind me to help me in my advocacy and education.

XRP,Bitcoin,Why I sold all my ethereum today and converted it all into Bitcoin,"It was a very hard moment for me, but I was minded by the great Andreas Antonopoulos, it takes discipline to be a good trader.

Buying when everything feels down is tough, but necessary if you want to profit. This is the most important mantra: buy when most people are selling, sell when most people are buying.

I was trying to figure out why it was so hard. I made a very good multiple on my original ethereum investment. I should be happy realizing those profits. I realized it was my greed to follow everybody else. Otherwise I'd be missing out.

What we're seeing today is our generation's .com bubble. When people are throwing hundreds of millions of dollars at eight pages of white paper, it doesn't take a genius that maybe, just maybe, each of those pages aren't worth $25 million each.

I do believe that one day, ethereum will be the transformative vehicle for new companies that will mint the next Google and Facebook. It'll be the agent that will change our lives as we know it.

But that day is not today. Fortunes will be lost and lives will be ruined.

There are so many obstacles that ethereum has yet to tackle. Enacting a transformative change from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, the chances of finding a show stopping bug in smart contracts, even just a whiff of one of the giant ICO companies imploding is enough to get weak hands to fold.

And there are so many weak hands in ethereum.

The vast majority of people investing in ethereum and ICO's haven't had the bitter taste of an equity dropping to 10% and having the discipline to hold on.

How do you have confidence a bridge will hold when a 200-ton semi truck drives across? When 200 of those trucks have already driven across.

Bitcoin has been around for 8 years. It has weathered attacks from the most determined hackers, gone through 3 of the largest crashes in equities, stood under scrutiny by the US government and yet it stands.

I know this for a fact. Bitcoin will be around post BIP-148. Bitcoin will be around next year. Bitcoin will be around the next decade. I'll sleep easy tonight knowing that my Bitcoin stored in my trusty Trezor is mine to keep, out of the 21 million that will ever exist in human history.

To plagiarize one of my favorite quotes:

Ethereum is the fancy McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart in a few months. Bitcoin is the old stone building that stands for centuries. I cannot respect someone who doesn't see the difference.

Plebs, Bitcoin miners, human rights defenders unite!  

The European Commission (EC) is about to take a draconian and unscientific stance towards Bitcoin that can not only pave the way for an EU mining ban, but could have far-reaching consequences for the entire global Bitcoin community.   

Context: The EC is developing a methodology to calculate and mitigate the environmental impact of Bitcoin. It includes a proposal to measure all crypto-assets resource consumption ""per transaction"", and only evaluates the negative impact of Bitcoin using a suite of suite of reports that have ben financially backed by Central Banks and Ripple Corporation. This is a nonsense metric that was been previously debunked by Cambridge University in 2018.  

The fact that the EC have ignored both the science, and the sea-change in the Bitcoin ESG narrative this year shows that their intentions have nothing to do with sustainability, and everything to do with protecting intrenched interests who could be disrupted by Bitcoin. If the EC wins, BTC will be officially labelled ""an environmentally harmful asset that undermines sustainability goals for the EU"".  

It will also enshrine the ECs right to use bogus-metrics to evaluate environmental impact, while ignoring quality peer-reviewed research showing the positive environmental externalities of Bitcoin.   

They will then promote this standards/labelling globally.

In your submission, highlight:  

✅ why and how Bitcoin can be a net-benefit to the environment  
✅ point out that a framework which only evaluate only negative externalities of a technology is incomplete, unobjective/ unscientific  
✅ cite high quality references. Show examples of how Bitcoin mining can help meet the EUs sustainability goals (for example: WOSTP has already written that ""vented methane based crypto-asset mining is more likely to help than hinder the US Govts climate objectives"")  
❌ DO NOT ""it's energy use is justified because"", ""Other assets use more energy"", or debating whether climate change is occurring or use language that personally attacks any one  
✅ DO highlight that every technology initially has a carbon footprint, use evidence to show that emissions are not increasing and that there is a realistic chance Bitcoin can become the first industry to fully mitigate emissions without offsets, point out known limitations in current models, use your own examples of Bitcoin's positive environmental impact that are less known   
✅ Retweet this message, and mobilize other honeybadgers   

Currently, the EU relies on reports like this: https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Final.pdf. Counter these claims, showing evidence of where they are provably false, misleading due to missing context, inaccurate, or no-longer-true.  

Now is the time to channel your time, passion, and brain into defending freedom. We do not have the resources, the entrenched powers, the ability to spread FUD widely through mainstream news channels that the opponents of Bitcoin do. We don't agree on everything as Bitcoiners. But we all agree on one thing: that is the need for a global currency together with global mining that cannot be centrally controlled, attacked, manipulated and suppressed.  

Today's the day to fight for the continuation of that freedom.

XRP,Bitcoin,Bitcoin vs Ripple,"I witness that firms (IBM and others) show increased interest in blockchain technology, but it seems that they have issues with Bitcoin (uncontrolled technology), which is per se not bad imo. 

If we take Ripple, which is also open source, it's backed by different commodities (gold) and currencies (USD) to operate, and its own currency (XRP) is just a proxy of the traded assets. Probably, on it's own (XRP) not that valuable.

Why should a financial institution adopt bitcoin (with or without sidechains, coloured coins), or go for Ripple? Because Bitcoin has the largest network?

XRP,Bitcoin,How I fucked up and turned ~600 BTC into 200 BTC,"Before I tell you how I fucked up, let me just say I am *very aware* of just how many newbie mistakes I made and how stupid I was. By all means, please feel free to laugh at my disgusting choices... the least my stupidity can do is serve as humor.

Back in May/June, I bought around 600 Bitcoin at around 2700 USD. I'll let you do the math on how much that cost me. But I believed in Bitcoin. The original plan was just to hold them forever. I was pretty convinced Bitcoin was going to go to $10K by 2018. Had I just left the Bitcoins in my wallet and done nothing, I would be pretty happy right now at $4000 per coin.

But no. I decided to try my hand at trading altcoins. I started off with Siacoin (this was back when there was hype around Siacoin).

Put in 10 bitcoins into Sia, at 450 satoshis... Next day, Siacoin went up to 600 satoshis. I was like ""Cool, this is easy, I just made a couple thousand dollars in a day.""

Next day I put in 20 Bitcoins into Antshares (now re-branded as NEO). Three days later, it went up as well. ""Cool, I just made 10 grand in three days! All I have to do is buy altcoins low and sell high. So easy. As long as I HODL and don't sell in panic and just wait it out until it rises, everything should be fine.""

You can guess where this story is heading... there's no happy endings here.

Basically, over the course of June, I invested pretty much ALL of my Bitcoins into alts, thinking they were going to keep going up and up. It was pure greed. Of course I should've just kept it in Bitcoin. Of course I should've done my research on some of these altcoins. Of course I should've not bought it at the very fucking *peak* before all the altcoins crashed.

Curious to see how badly I fucked up?

Here's a list = all the altcoins I bought, how much BTC I spent on them, and how much BTC they're worth now. Feel free to roast me, cause you could not get more stupid than this (especially putting that much money and faith into some of these altcoins).

- Siacoin = 246.82 BTC → 72.94 (minus 70%)
- CloakCoin = 139.27 BTC → 41.59 (minus 70%)
- Factom = 120.72 BTC → 44.17 BTC (minus 63%)
- Monero = 18.76 BTC → 12.96 BTC (minus 31%)
- BitShares = 13.18 BTC → 4.54 BTC (minus 66%)
- Crown = 10.26 → 4.05 BTC (minus 61%)
- ZCash = 9.77 BTC → 4.13 BTC (minus 58%)
- Golem = 9.13 BTC → 2.7 BTC (minus 70%)
- GameCredits = 8.49 BTC → 3.1 BTC (minus 63%)
- LBRY Credits = 5.71 BTC → 2.55 BTC (minus 55%)
- BitcoinDark = 5.03 BTC → 1.96 BTC (minus 61%)
- Ripple = 4.98 BTC → 2.03 BTC (minus 59%)
- EmerCoin = 4.76 BTC → 2.02 BTC (minus 57%)
- Digibyte = 4.38 BTC → 1.55 BTC (minus 65%)
- Waves = 4.05 BTC → 2.76 BTC (minus 31%)
- Ubiq = 3.89 BTC → 1.74 BTC (minus 55%)
- Vertcoin = 3.35 BTC → 1.2 BTC (minus 64%)
- Lumen = 3.06 BTC → 0.95 BTC (minus 69%)
- Stratis = 2.96 BTC → 1.78 BTC (minus 40%)
- SysCoin = 2.76 BTC → 0.98 BTC (minus 64%)
- Ethereum = 2.53 BTC → 1.43 BTC (minus 43%)
- MaidSafeCoin = 1.94 BTC → 0.96 BTC (minus 50%)
- Komodo = 1.93 BTC → 0.94 BTC (minus 51%)
- Voxels = 1.35 BTC → 0.67 BTC (minus 50%)
- NEM (XEM) = 1 BTC → 0.88 BTC (minus 12%)
- BitCrystals = 1 BTC → 0.41 BTC (minus 58%)
- Ardor = 1 BTC → 0.34 BTC (minus 65%)
- Wings DAO = 0.25 BTC → 0.15 BTC (minus 37%)
- Expanse = 0.14 BTC → 0.05 BTC (minus 60%)

Why didn't I put in any stop losses? Cause I was stupid. Why did I keep holding onto these coins despite the massive fall in value? Cause I believed they would eventually turn around.

Trust me, I ask myself every day how I could've made THIS many bad decisions at the same time.

I totally get you if you think I'm making up this story and how could anyone be stupid enough to spend 200 BTC on Siacoin. Pure greed. I thought Siacoin would keep going up, and I could make a quick profit.

The only mistake I haven't made is sold any of the coins at a loss. Even as I saw the altcoins go down, I convinced myself that all I needed to do was HODL.

I'm still holding. Still hoping that eventually some of these might go back up to the value they were before, and I can sell them off at break even.

Of course I'm tempted to sell them all. Take any BTC I can get for them. Maybe put it into NEO (that train already left though) or some other altcoin that I hope will blow up. But of course that too would be an impulsive mistake. I'm just scared shitless, so I hold. I've made every single mistake I could made, except selling at a loss.

""Just hold."" everyone says. So I do. But the people who say ""hold"" usually didn't spend 600 BTC on altcoins and watched their portfolio go down to about 200 BTC.

By the way, I know that when you compare it to USD value, not all of these altcoins have dropped that much. But that's not what I look at. USD value is deceptive, cause BTC keeps going up.

What I care about is BTC value. I'd give anything to just have my 600 BTC back (which of course would now be worth way more than the $2700 per coin I spent on them).

I realize that the chances of these altcoins ever going back to the peak that we had in June / July are very slim... the more BTC keeps rising, the less satoshis each of these coins is worth. Trust me, I know how much I fucked up.

Anyway.... feel free to laugh at my stupidity.

I'm open to any suggestions as to what to do with my altcoins now, whether I should just sell them back and get ~200 BTC for them, or wait for some of these to turn around... I genuinely don't know how to make this any less of a fuck-up.

***

**EDIT:** To answer some questions that have popped up:

Some of you are having a hard time believing someone who has this type of money can lose it in such a stupid way. Earning money, keeping it, and growing it are different skills. I fucked up on the last two.

A few of you asked how I bought 600 Bitcoins all at once. I used an OTC called Genesis Trading. Minimum buy order is 25K. You negotiate a bid, then you wire them the money, and they send the BTC to your wallet.

I don't have any NEO. I sold it when it got to break even, and then it exploded to current levels. So not only did I fuck up by investing in alts that went down, the one single coin that went up, I sold before it exploded.

I will reply to comments. I'm just catching up and reading everything that everyone posted and taking it all in.

Thank you to everyone who replied.",664,2017-08-13 16:10:12,661

XRP,Bitcoin,"Canadian mortgage broker enables Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple payments","Founded in 2008, **Matrix Mortgage Global** enables customers to receive financing on housing that has carried out over $1.5 billion in mortgage originations. The company has “championed alternative lending” since its inception, and its latest announcement could be regarded as another step in that direction.

Through a partnership with the US-based crypto service provider **BitPay**, Matrix Mortgage Global will enable all customers to pay for goods and services with some of the most popular crypto assets. Namely, those *Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum*, and several dollar-pegged stablecoins. However, the announcement didn’t specify which stablecoins the firm will implement.

The introduction of digital assets aims to expand the company into international markets where “accepting credit cards is not practical.” Furthermore, the addition will increase payment transparency, speed, and efficiency, while reducing high fees.

“As an innovator in the mortgage industry, we decided to accept cryptocurrency to better align ourselves with the shift towards the global adoption of digital currency. Blockchain technology with the use of smart contracts is going to change the way mortgages are processed.” – commented MMG Founder Shawn Allen.

XRP,Bitcoin,Reminder: emergent consensus is what Ripple Labs tried with the new Ripple.,"As we know mining has unfortunately become strongly centralised in Bitcoin. This has very damaging effects on the things that make Bitcoin valuable, both in a monetary sense and as a project trying to further the goals of crypto-anarchy.

Some allege some form of emergent consensus will help solve this, but I'm skeptical. The best-known proposal (BU) would almost certainly do the opposite, and it's not clear if there are viable alternatives that would work.

Consider the case of Ripple, specifically the new version of Ripple created by OpenCoin -> Ripple Labs -> Ripple. In the new Ripple validation is currently also very centralised, as there is a central core controlled by Ripple Inc.

(In Ryan Fugger's old Ripple things were even more centralised, as you had to conduct your tx on a ledger controlled by a single part, although you could choose which ledger and server to use).

In principle Ripple validation does not have to be centralised at all, as every validating node gets to choose its peers in a sort of trust relationship that is distinct from the trust graph related to the IOU system of rippling that is the heart of both the old and the new Ripple.

However, if people choose different set of validators there is a very real risk that they will not reach a global consensus so the ledger would fracture. Therefore basically everybody currently relies on a small set of servers run by Ripple Inc and its affiliates and this small set does not reciprocally trust other servers outside this set. In a way the emergent consensus has been to trust Ripple Inc.

In the long run this could change, because if there is a dense global mesh of mutually trusting validators with significant overlap then a global, distributed consensus would likely emerge. The big unanswered question is how to get there from here.

Similarly, a hub-and-spoke system for IOU trust relationships could draw in large numbers of people, who could then form P2P trust relationships, thus creating the originally intended mesh network of individuals who no longer have to rely on professional intermediaries. This appears still to be Ryan Fugger's hope.

TLDR: emergent consensus is a nice ideal, but there is a real risk of massive fracturing of the ledger and Ripple demonstrates that the fear of that may lead to total centralisation instead.

EDIT: To clarify, I meant that *once you go down the path of emergent consensus* the fear of fracturing the ledger may lead to total centralisation instead.",28,2017-02-26 08:04:33,15
XRP,Bitcoin,Bitcoin statement came from Peter Brandt on the day of Ripple lawsuit ⁉️,"Peter Brandt said Bitcoin could rise to $ 200,000, but the road to this goal could be bumpy.
In a recent tweet, veteran trader Peter Brandt suggested that Bitcoin could potentially reach $ 200,000 during this bull cycle.


The questionnaire was presented to determine how bumpy the road to its destination would be. Most respondents believe that Bitcoin will face six major fixes before it eventually reaches $ 200,000.

Some of the respondents in the survey state that they expect a 10% correction, while others say they expect a 16% correction.

Not a straight road

Brandt tweeted that Bitcoin entered its third parabolic progression after touching $ 50,000 last week.

However, any bull run is now a straight path. Therefore, major corrections are expected to be made widely. For example, as predicted by Brandt, Bitcoin made nine corrections that exceeded 30 percent in the previous bull cycle.

Last month, Bitcoin corrected 31.54 percent from $ 42,000 on January 8, and fell to $ 28,883 on January 22. The cryptocurrency continued its upward trend in early February.

As of now, Brandt says it will gladly purchase every 20 percent correction.

Subject to regulation and easily targeted by world governments and hackers alike, centralized exchanges have no place in the new economy. Tragically, the Bitcoin community has trashed the very savior of Bitcoin transactions from the start: Ripple. Ripple offers a means to conduct transactions instantly with little to no fees in a decentralized manner. This means no longer do we have to wait for confirmations or trust exchanges to be technically capable or safe from a regulatory standpoint - no longer do we have to rely on centralized merchanting solutions. We can bypass confirmation times and reduce fraud to zero by conducting merchanting on the Ripple protocol. Why hasn't the Bitcoin community caught on? Now is the perfect time - when Mt.

XRP,Bitcoin,This Is Why I Think Ripple is Superior to Bitcoin...,"Most of the transactions we currently do in the financial realm of our lives rely on trust based systems.

Bitcoin, brilliant in design, sidesteps the need for most of this trust.

Bitcoin is a sort of digital gold with a built in transaction system.  Awesome and very useful.

Bitcoin's base value comes from fanboys, folks willing to take a stand for their monetary ideology, but most importantly its usefulness in transactions that can't be done online for legal reasons or when a person would prefer not to reveal their identity.  Due to this base value, it has attracted speculators who have driven up its price way beyond its value based on its base uses.

That said, in every day transactions, is it useful or practical for people to exchange their dollars (or other currency), pay 4% to move it to Bitinstant so they can get it into MTGOX, so that they can buy some Bitcoin (another 1/2 % fee), so that they can buy a pizza at their corner store?    I'm going to go out on a limb and say ""no.""

This is the MAIN problem with Bitcoin.  It is not useful as a transaction system to purchase every day items and does not fit well into the current system.   Would you exchange your dollars for euros to buy a pizza in the USA?   Then why would you do that with Bitcoin?  You wouldn't unless you already had a bunch of Bitcoin or you were living your ideology.

Ripple on the other hand, is first and foremost a PAYMENT AND TRANSACTION SYSTEM.   It can handle trust based transactions that people currently use and will therefore be readily accepted into everyday use (unlike Bitcoin).

So where does XRP and ripples (the currency in Ripple) fit in this equation?

I'm guessing but...

Opencoin, Inc., is smart in that they have printed up the currency in their instance of the pre-open source server almost like a stock issue. They have a certain number of shares that they are banking will increase in value, since xrp is the Bitcoin/gold in the Ripple system. They can hand out these ""shares"" like an IPO without the usual regulatory rigmorole and without having banks in between each transaction. Ingenious in my opinion. However, as mainly a transaction system, the value of the xrp will only increase and be worth something if Opencoin Inc. gains an early mover advantage in the market with their version of Ripple.

Anyone can make a Facebook clone even though Facebook isn't open source. The software isn't what makes Facebook worth something. It's the network of people and the infrastructure possible because of it. I think Opencoin is attempting to reach the critical mass needed to make sure that their instance of the server is looked at more favorably because of the network adoption vs. a clone.

If they succeed then their xrp will be worth quite a bit, in my opinion. If they don't they can still make money consulting with people running or implementing the software. The former would be preferable I would think.

So Ripple is taking the exact opposite approach of Bitcoin to gain adoption of xrp.   Bitcoin people have to convince others to use Bitcoin in situations where they would normally use their regular currency.   Ripple will merely need to get people to use their payment network for currencies they are already used to (by partnering with banks and other financial services) and xrp will become valuable as a result of that (it being the only trust-free currency in Ripple).",0,2013-05-10 19:24:48,23

XRP,Bitcoin,My two words about Ripple,"There is a lot of misunderstanding about what xrp and Ripple as whole is. Ripple as system was designed as mean of creation and distribution of IOUs. ANY IOUs.
 Most counterproductive disputes however escalate around ""xrp as currency"" topic. Let me make this clear: xrp was created as mean of preventing transaction spam in the system. 

Now about this ""xrp is currency!"" thing:
xrp is scarce resource, like oil, gold, silver, that is slowly used up (permanently destroyed) for transaction processing purposes. There was nobody who said ""THIS IS CURRENCY - I SAID SO, SO IT IS!""... As there was nobody who said such thing in case of gold, silver, or bitcoin. 

Money can be any scarse resource, xrp have properties nesessery to faciliate transactions, but it is only for society to decide if it will ever be used in such way.

Now, why Ripple is awesome?
Imagine all bitcoin exchanges are also ripple gateways that trust each other for large sums of money.
Now one of exchanges gets overloaded, and you want exchange your fiat for BTC NOW. Normally it takes days to transfer fiat from one exchange to another one. But with Ripple, you can ask exchange for IOU equal to amount of fiat you have stored in particular exchange, and pay for bitcoins with that IOU on another one. Exchages will settle fiat imbalance later. 

Brilliant! Fast arbitrage between exchanges would be piece of cake, reducing spreads even on most illiquid markets.

Now why Ripple SUCK?
Because of xrp distribution. We all know that xrp is slowly being used up to facliate transactions. We also know that Ripple creators will always have most of the 100 trillion xrp.

Funny thing: If xrp were only currency and nothing more I wouldnt care. OpenCoin would have their fun until they sold all xrp - probably with ridiculously high gains. And then their parasitism would end. Just like in case of bitcoin early adopters.

But there are three factors we have o take into account:
1. xrp are destroyed with every transaction
2. Amount of xrp destroyed per transaction will slowly decrease in order to prevent running out of xrp completly.
3. In order to make transactions, you must buy xrp on free market.

They basically given up lots of xrp for free knowing that in early stage xrp is destroyed quickly. When system developes and large amounts of transactions will be processed, market will run out of xrp and will be hungry for more. And guess what? Since OpenCoin is in possesion of most xrp, they will have greater and greater controll over its price and supply. 

**Situation in witch one entity is effectively in control of nearly all xrp supply, and therefore dictates market price, and therefore real transaction fees is unacceptable.**

Additionally, there comes problem of loss or steal.
**If Ripple devs lose large amount of xrp, then supply will go dry and market price go up increasing transaction costs until system dies**

**If their xrp get STOLEN, then thief selling large quantities on market will cause massive price crash and will reduce transaction costs to level where system is spammable again, leading to its collapse**

I will NEVER support single entity monoply in any form and neither should YOU. In current shape and design Ripple is spawn of evil, and until proper, open source and honest version of this system emerge I wont support it.",0,2013-05-07 12:37:38,18

There is also no reason to reinvent the wheel when Gnunet exists, and Open Transactions can be run inside Gnunet using their DHT naming service. Just make sure your git account is totally untraceable.

XRP,Bitcoin,Keiser Report rejects comment re: Bitcoin competitor Ripple,"

I submitted the comment below on the Keiser Report today (2014 Dec 9) and it never appeared. The comment was associated with the BitPay interview.

Not a single mention of XRP, Ripple, Ripple Trade or Ripple Labs
--

The real issue with Bitcoin is the transaction processing time (interval). With Ripple the interval is effectively zero, while with Bitcoin it is exactly one hour or six (6) confirmations by the miners to ensure that the block in question is added to the 'blockchain'.

Bitcoin is going to be seriously challenged by this transaction processing problem. It is important to note that, Ripple will transact in Bitcoin. So if I were a betting person... I would bet on Ripple Networks and Bitcoin currency, but not the BlockChain and the miners.

What is intriguing is FoxTrot, as this technology provides a method to pass network provisioning costs onto the sender, and/or recipient, if their machine opens the Inbound socket. So it maybe time to look at who invented FoxTrot.

Now, if I were a conspiracy oriented thinker... this FoxTrot would be intriguing.",0,2014-12-10 00:14:33,13

XRP,Bitcoin,"Decentralized exchanges? Ripple, OpenTransactions?","I think it is time to talk about decentralized currency exchanges. 

Decentralized exchange mechanism could use a transaction cryptographic protocol similar to that of Bitcoin itself, but it needs some 'tokens' to represent other currencies. And, of course, people who will exchange those tokens for real money.

I know two basic methods to do this:

1. Issuance of private currencies by exchangers. Let's call it the OpenTransactions method
2. Trust-based loans between exchangers. Let's call it the Ripple method.

-----

1. With OpenTransactions each exchanger (or group of thereof) will issue and control its own private currency. Let's say killlerstorm and his friends will use ksUSD. They will exchange real, physical USD for digital ksUSD, and then one can change ksUSD <-> BTC using cryptography and shit like this. I call it OpenTransactions because [there is a framework](https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/wiki) to do this stuff, so it is possible to build a system on top of it.

2. With Ripple approach exchangers which trust each other provide lines of credit to each other, and those are used to settle transactions. If there is not enough credit physical settlement will have to be made. [See here](http://ripple-project.org/).

I think both of them can work both with centralized authoriative server and with bitcoin-like protocol.

From user's perspective it might look like this: user first needs to convert his USD into an accepted digital equivalent. To do this he needs to choose one of exchangers -- maybe a local one (who sells dUSD for cash), maybe one which works with certain payment processor, maybe one which offers lowest fees. Anyway, after doing this he has some amount of dUSD. Then he goes to _one of_ exchange sites and makes some dUSD->BTC transactions. Some time later he might choose to convert BTC to USD back, so he first needs to convert BTC to dUSD, and then withdraw dUSD to physical USD.

Are there any existing efforts to implement something like this?",18,2011-06-22 00:25:23,15

XRP,Bitcoin,An extensive guide for cashing out bitcoin and cryptocurrencies into private banks,"Hey guys. 


Merry Xmas !  



I am coming back to you with a follow up post, as I have helped many people cash out this year and I have streamlined the process. After [my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6e7o79/a_simple_guide_for_the_bitcoin_millionaire_who/), I received many requests to be more specific and provide more details. I thought that after the amazing rally we have been attending over the last few months, and the volatility of the last few days, it would be interesting to revisit more extensively. 

The attitude of banks around crypto is changing slowly, but it is still a tough stance. For the first partial cash out I operated around a year ago for a client, it took me months to find a bank. They wouldn’t want to even consider the case and we had to knock at each and every door. Despite all my contacts it was very difficult back in the days. This has changed now, and banks have started to open their doors, but there is a process, a set of best practices and codes one has to follow. 

I often get requests from crypto guys who are very privacy-oriented, and it takes me months to have them understand that I am bound by Swiss law on banking secrecy, and I am their ally in this onboarding process. It’s funny how I have to convince people that banks are legit, while on the other side, banks ask me to show that crypto millionaires are legit. I have a solid background in both banking and in crypto so I manage to make the bridge, but yeah sometimes it is tough to reconcile the two worlds. I am a crypto enthusiast myself and I can say that after years of work in the banking industry I have grown disillusioned towards banks as well, like many of you. Still an account in a Private bank is convenient and powerful. So let’s get started. 




-     **A. What is required to open an account in a Private bank when you made your fortune through crypto.**


There are two different aspects to your onboarding in a Swiss Private bank, compliance-wise. 

*The origin of your crypto wealth 

*Your background (residence, citizenship and probity)

These two aspects must be documented in-depth.
 
 
**How to document your crypto wealth.**
Each new crypto millionaire has a different story. I may detail a few fun stories later in this post, but at the end of the day, most of crypto rich I have met can be categorized within the following profiles: the miner, the early adopter, the trader, the corporate entity, the black market, the libertarian/OTC buyer. The real question is how you prove your wealth is legit.
 
**1.        Context around the original amount/investment**
Generally speaking, your first crypto purchase may not be documented. But the context around this acquisition can be. I have had many cases where the original amount was bought through Mtgox, and no proof of purchase could be provided, nor could be documented any Mtgox claim. That’s perfectly fine. At some point Mtgox amounted 70% of the bitcoin transactions globally, and people who bought there and managed to withdraw and keep hold of their bitcoins do not have any Mtgox claim. This is absolutely fine. However, if you can show me the record of a wire from your bank to Tisbane (Mtgox's parent company) it's a great way to start.
 
Otherwise, what I am trying to document here is the following:
I need context.
If you made your first purchase by saving from summer jobs, show me a payroll. Even if it was USD 2k.
If you acquired your first bitcoins from mining, show me the bills of your mining equipment from 2012 or if it was through a pool mine, give me your slushpool account ref for instance.
If you were given bitcoin against a service you charged, show me an invoice.



**2.	Tracking your wealth until today and making sense of it.**
What I have been doing over the last few months was basically educating compliance officers. Thanks God, the blockchain is a global digital ledger! I have been telling my auditors and compliance officers they have the best tool at their disposal to lead a proper investigation.
Whether you like it or not, your wealth can be tracked, from address to address. You may have thought all along this was a bad feature, but I am telling you, if you want to cash out, in the context of Private Banking onboarding, tracking your wealth through the block explorer is a boon. We can see the inflows, outflows. We can see the age behind an address. An early adopter who bought 1000 BTC in 2010, and let his bitcoin behind one address and held thus far is legit, whether or not he has a proof of purchase to show. That’s just common sense. My job is to explain that to the banks in a language they understand.


Let’s have a look at a few examples and how to document the few profiles I mentioned earlier.

**The trader.**
I love traders. These are easy cases. I have a ton of respect for them. Being a trader myself in investment banks for a decade earlier in my career has taught me that controlling one’s emotions and having the discipline to impose oneself some proper risk management system is really really hard.  Further, being able to avoid the exchange bankruptcy and hacks throughout crypto history is outstanding. It shows real survival instinct, or just plain blissed ignorance.
In any cases traders at exchange are easy cases to corroborate since their whole track record is potentially available. Some traders I have met have automated their trading and have shown me more than 500k trades done over the span of 4 years. Obviously in this kind of scenario I don’t show everything to the bank to avoid information overload, and prefer to do some snacking here and there. My strategy is to show the early trades, the most profitable ones, explain the trading strategy and (partially expose) the situation as of now with id pages of the exchanges and current balance.
Many traders have become insensitive to the risk of parking their crypto at exchange as they want to be able to trade or to grasp an occasion any minute, so they generally do not secure a substantial portion on the blockchain which tends to make me very nervous.

**The early adopter.**
Provided that he has not mixed his coin, the early adopter or “hodler” is not a difficult case either. 
Who cares how you bought your first 10k btc if you bought them below 3$ ? Even if you do not have a purchase proof, I would generally manage to find ways. We just have to corroborate the original 30’000 USD investment in this case.
I mainly focus on three things here:

*proof of early adoption  
I have managed to educate some banks on a few evidences specifically related to crypto markets. For instance with me, an old bitcointalk account can serve as a proof of early adoption. Even an old reddit post from a few years ago where you say how much you despise this Ripple premined scam can prove to be a treasure readily available to show you were early.

*story telling  
Compliance officers like to know when, why and how. They are human being looking for simple answers to simple questions and they don’t want like to be played fool. Telling the truth, even without a proof can do wonders, and even though bluffing might still work because banks don’t fully understand bitcoin yet, it is a risky strategy that is less and less likely to pay off as they are getting more sophisticated by the day.

*micro transaction from an old address you control  
This is the killer feature. Send a $20 worth transaction from an old address to my company wallet and to one of my partner bank’s wallet and you are all set ! This is gold and considered a very solid piece of evidence. You can also do a microtransaction to your own wallet, but banks generally prefer transfer to their own wallet. Patience with them please. they are still learning.

*signature message  
Why do a micro transaction when you can sign a message and avoid potentially tainting your coins ?

*ICO millionaire  
Some clients made their wealth participating in ETH crowdsale or IOTA ICO. They were very easy to deal with obviously and the account opening was very smooth since we could evidence the GENESIS TxHash flow.

**The miner**
Not so easy to proof the wealth is legit in that case. 
Most early miners never took screenshot of the blocks on bitcoin core, nor did they note down the block number of each block they mined. Until the the Slashdot article from August 2010 anyone could mine on his laptop, let his computer run overnight and wake up to a freshly minted block containing 50 bitcoins back in the days. Not many people were structured enough to store and secure these coins, avoid malwares while syncing the blockchain continuously, let alone document the mined blocks in the process. What was 50 BTC worth really for the early miners ? dust of dollars, games and magic cards… Even miners post 2010 are generally difficult to deal with in terms of compliance onboarding. Many pool mining are long dead. Deepbit is down for instance and the founders are MIA.
So my strategy to proof mining activity is as follow:

*Focusing on IT background whenever possible.  
An IT background does  help a lot to bring some substance to the fact you had the technical ability to operate a mining rig.

*Showing mining equipment receipts.  
If you mined on your own you must have bought the hardware to do so. For instance mining equipment receipts from butterfly lab from 2012-2013 could help document your case. Similarly, high electricity bill from your household on a consistent basis back in the day could help. I have already unlocked a tricky case in the past with such documents when the bank was doubtful.

*Wallet.dat files with block mining transactions from 2011 thereafter  
This obviously is a fantastic piece of evidence for both you and me if you have an old wallet and if you control an address that received original mined blocks, (even if the wallet is now empty). I will make sure compliance officers understand what it means, and as for the early adopter, you can prove your control over these wallet through a microtransaction. With these kind of addresses, I can show on the block explorer the mined block rewards hitting at regular time interval, and I can even spot when difficulty level increased or when halvening process happened.


*Poolmining account.  
Here again I have educated my partner bank to understand that a slush account opened in 2013 or an OnionTip presence was enough to corroborate mining activity. The block explorer then helps me to do the bridge with your current wallet.


*Describing your set up and putting it in context  
In the history of mining we had CPU, GPU, FPG and  ASICs mining. I will describe your technical set up and explain why and how your set up was competitive at that time.


**The corporate entity**
Remember 2012 when we were all convinced bitcoin would take over the world, and soon everyone would pay his coffee in bitcoin? How naïve we were to think transaction fees would remain low forever. I don’t blame bitcoin cash supporters; I once shared this dream as well. Remember when we thought global adoption was right around the corner and some brick and mortar would soon accept bitcoin transaction as a common mean of payment? Well, some shop actually did accept payment and held. 
I had a few cases as such of shops holders, who made it to the multi million mark holding and had invoices or receipts to proof the transactions. If you are organized enough to keep a record for these trades and are willing to cooperate for the documentation, you are making your life easy.
The digital advertising business is also a big market for the bitcoin industry, and affiliates partner compensated in btc are common. It is good to show an invoice, it is better to show a contract. If you do not have a contract (which is common since all advertising deals are about ticking a check box on the website to accept terms and conditions), there are ways around that. If you are in that case, pm me.

**The black market**
Sorry guys, I can’t do much for you officially. Not that I am judging you. I am a libertarian myself. It’s just already very difficult to onboard legit btc adopters, so the black market is a market I cannot afford to consider.  My company is regulated so KYC and compliance are key for me if I want to stay in business. Behind each case I push forward I am risking the credibility and reputation I have built over the years. So I am sorry guys I am not risking it to make an extra buck. Your best hope is that crypto will eventually take over the world and you won’t need to cash out anyway. Or go find a Lithuanian bank that is light on compliance and cooperative.

**The OTC buyer and the libertarian.**
Generally a very difficult case. If you bought your stack during your journey in Japan 5 years ago to a guy you never met again; or if you accumulated on https://localbitcoins.com/ and kept no record or lost your account, it is going to be difficult. Not impossible but difficult. We will try to build a case with everything else we have, and I may be able to onboard you. However I am risking a lot here so I need to be 100% confident you are legit, before I defend you. Come & see me in Geneva, and we will talk. I will run forensic services like [elliptic](https://www.elliptic.co/), [chainalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/), or [scorechain](https://scorechain.com/) on an extract of your wallet. If this scan does not raise too many red flags, then maybe we can work together !
If you mixed your coins all along your crypto history, and shredded your seeds because you were paranoid, or if you made your wealth mining professionally monero over the last 3 years but never opened an account at an exchange.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I am not a magician and don’t get me wrong, I love monero, it’s not the point.


**Cashing out ICOs**
Private companies or foundations who have ran an ICO generally have a very hard time opening a bank account.
The few banks that accept such projects would generally look at 4 criteria:

*Seriousness of the project  
Extensive study of the whitepaper to limit the reputation risk

*AML of the onboarding process  
ICOs 1.0 have no chance basically if a background check of the investors has not been conducted

*Structure of the moral entity  
List of signatories, certificate of incumbency, work contract, premises...

*Fiscal conformity  
Did the company informed the authorities and seek a fiscal ruling.


-        **B. The tax issue**
I am not a tax specialist, but I can say that this year I have seen it all.
Again I am not judging. You made $100m hodling, and still wouldn’t pay your taxes ? Your decision.**I personally advise everyone to pay their taxes, but also to be generous, to give to charities. I mean you eventually made it. Good for you. What about you contribute to make the world a better place now?** I will stop patronizing you. It’s just my 2cts, and it’s your money.

For the record, I am not into the tax avoidance business, so people come to me with a set up and I see if I can make it work within the legal framework imposed to me.

First, stop thinking Switzerland is a “offshore heaven”
Swiss banks have made deals with many governments for the exchange of fiscal information. If you are a French citizen, resident in France and want to open an account in a Private Bank in Switzerland to cash out your bitcoins, you will get slaughtered (>60%). There are ways around that, and I could refer you to good tax specialists for fiscal optimization, but I cannot organize it myself. It would be illegal for me.
Swiss private  banks makes it easy for you to keep a good your relation with your retail bank and continue paying your bills without headaches. They are integrated to SEPA, provide ebanking and credit cards.

For information, these are the kind of set up some of my clients came up with. It’s all legal; obviously I do not onboard clients that are not tax compliant. Further disclaimer: I did not contribute myself to these set up. Do not ask me to organize it for you. I won’t.


**EU tricks**

**[Swiss lump sum taxation](https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2016/06/ch-lump-sum-taxation-en.pdf)**
Foreign nationals resident in Switzerland can be taxed on a lump-sum basis if they are not gainfully employed in our country. Under the lump-sum tax regime, foreign nationals taking residence in Switzerland may choose to pay an expense-based tax instead of ordinary income and wealth tax. Attractive cantons for the lump sum taxation are Zug, Vaud, Valais, Grisons, Lucerne and Berne. To make it short, you will be paying somewhere between 200 and 400k a year and all expenses will be deductible.

Switzerland has adopted a very friendly attitude towards crypto currency in general. There is a whole crypto valley in Zug now. 30% of ICOs are operated in Switzerland. The reason is that Switzerland has thrived for centuries on banking secrecy, and today with FATCA and exchange of fiscal info with EU, banking secrecy is dead. Regulators in Switzerland have understood that digital ledger technologies were a way to roll over this competitive advantage for the generations to come. Switzerland does not tax capital gains on crypto profits. The Finma has a very pragmatic approach. They have issued [guidance](https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2017/09/20170919-mm-coin-anbieter/)- [updated guidelines here](https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2018/02/20180216-mm-ico-wegleitung/). They let the business get organized and operate their analysis on a case per case basis. Only after getting a deep understanding of the market will they issue a global fintech license in 2019. This approach is much more realistic than legislations which try to regulate everything beforehand.



**[Italy new tax exemption.](http://www.wfw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WFW-NON-DOM-Italy-January-2017.pdf)**
It’s a brand new fiscal exemption. Go to Aoste, get residency and you could be taxed a 100k/year for 10years. Yes, [really](http://www.ey.com/gl/en/services/people-advisory-services/hc-alert--italy-introduces-special-tax-and-immigration-rules-to-attract-foreign-workers-and-investors).



**[Portugal](https://www.blevinsfranks.com/news/article/NHR-Portugal-ten-years-tax-free-pensions)**
What’s crazy in Europe is the lack of fiscal harmonization. Even if no one in Brussels dares admit it, every other country is doing fiscal dumping. Portugal is such a country and has proved very friendly fiscally speaking. I personally have a hard time trusting Europe.  I have witnessed what happened in Greece over the last few years. Some of our ultra high net worth clients got stuck with capital controls. I mean no way you got out of crypto to have your funds confiscated at the next financial crisis!
Anyway. [FYI](http://www.livinginportugal.com/en/moving-to-portugal/tax-regime-for-non-habitual-residents/)

**[Malta](http://www.nomoretax.eu/living/relocation-to-malta/)**
Generally speaking, if you get a residence somewhere you have to live there for a certain period of time. Being stuck in Italy is no big deal with Schengen Agreement, but in Malta it is a different story.
In Malta, the ordinary residence scheme is more attractive than the HNWI residence scheme. Being an individual, you can hold a residence permit under this scheme and pay zero income tax in Malta in a completely legal way. 


**[Monaco](http://www.bradleyhackford.com/en/monaco-relocation-monaco-tax-residency/)**
Not suitable for French citizens, but for other Ultra High Net worth individual, Monaco is worth considering. You need an account at a local bank as a proof of fortune, and this account generally has to be seeded with at least EUR500k. You also need a proof of residence. I do mean UHNI because if you don’t cash out minimum 30m it’s not interesting. Everything is expensive in Monaco. Real Estate is EUR 50k per square meter. A breakfast at Monte Carlo Bay hotel is 70 EUR. Monaco is sunny but sometimes it feels like a golden jail. Do you really want that for your kids? 


**Dubaï**

1.	Set up a company in Dubaï, get your resident card.

2.	 Spend one day every  6 month there

3.	???

4.	Be tax free

**US tricks**
Some Private banks in Geneva do have the license to manage the assets of US persons and U.S citizens. However, do not think it is a way to avoid paying taxes in the US. Opening an account at an authorized Swiss Private banks is literally the same tax-wise as opening an account at Fidelity or at Bank of America in the US. The only difference is that you will avoid all the horror stories. Horror stories are all real by the way. In Switzerland, if you build a decent case and answer all the questions and corroborate your case in depth, you will manage to convince compliance officers beforehand. When the money eventually hits your account, it is actually available and not frozen.

The IRS and FATCA require to file FBAR if an offshore account is open. However FBAR is a reporting requirement and does not have taxes related to holding an account outside the US. The taxes would be the same if the account was in the US. However penalties for non compliance with FBAR are very large. The tax liability management is actually performed through the management of the assets ( for exemple by maximizing long term capital gains and minimizing short term gains).

The case for [Porto Rico](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/technology/cryptocurrency-puerto-rico.html).
Full disclaimer here. I am not encouraging this. Have not collaborated on such tax avoidance schemes. if you are interested I strongly encourage you to seek a tax advisor and get a legal opinion. I am not responsible for anything written below. I am not going to say much because I am so afraid of uncle Sam that I prefer to humbly pass the hot potato to [pwc](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/hr-management-services/newsletters/global-watch/assets/pwc-puerto-rico-income-tax-exemption-granted-non-residents.pdf)
From here all it takes is a good advisor and some creativity to be tax free on your crypto wealth if you are a US person apparently.   Please, please please don’t ask me more. And read the disclaimer again.


**Trust tricks**
Generally speaking I do not accept fringe fiscal situation because it puts me in a difficult situation to the banks I work with, and it is already difficult enough to defend a legit crypto case.  Trust might be a way to optimize your fiscal situation. Belize. Bahamas. Seychelles. Panama, You name it. At the end of the day, what matters for Swiss Banks are the beneficial owner and the settlor. Get a legal opinion, get it done, and when you eventually knock at a private bank’s door, don’t say it was for fiscal avoidance you stupid ! You will get the door smashed upon you. Be smarter. It will work. My advice is just to have it done by a great tax specialist lawyer, even if it costs you some money, as the entity itself needs to be structured in a professional way. Remember that with trust you are dispossessing yourself off your wealth. Not something to be taken lightly.

**“Anonymous” cash out.**
Right. I think I am not going into this topic, neither expose the ways to get it done. Pm me for details. I already feel a bit uncomfortable with all the info I have provided. I am just going to mention many people fear that crypto exchange might become reporting entities soon, and rightly so. This might happen anyday. You have been warned.
FYI, this only works for non-US and large cash out.

**The difference between traders an investors.**
Danmark, Holland and Germany all make a huge difference if you are a passive investor or if you are a trader.
ICO is considered investing for instance and is not taxed, while trading might be considered as income and charged aggressively. I would try my best to protect you and put a focus on your investor profile whenever possible, so you don't have to pay 52% tax if you do not have to :D


-      **C. The cash out itself**
So you have accumulated patiently a good amount of wealth. For some of us who have been involved in crypto since 2010, it took years. Remember when BTC was stuck at 200$ for months? I personally feel like it was yesterday. There is no way you screw up your wealth by cashing out in a hurry or with low security standards. Here is how the cash out takes should place.

**Full cash out or partial cash out?**
People who have been sitting on crypto for long have grown an emotional and irrational link with their coins. They come to me and say, look, I have 50m in crypto but I would like to cash out 500k only.
So first let me tell you that as a wealth manager my advice to you is to take some off the table. Doing a partial cash out is absolutely fine. The market is bullish. We are witnessing a redistribution of wealth at a global scale. Bitcoin is the real #occupywallstreet, and every one will discuss crypto at Xmas eve which will make the market even more supportive beginning 2018, especially with all hedge funds entering the scene. If you want to stay exposed to bitcoin and altcoins, and believe these techs will change the world, it’s just natural you want to keep some coins.
In the meantime, if you have lived off pizzas over the last years, and have the means to now buy yourself an nice house and have an account at a private bank, then f***ing do it mate !
Buy physical gold with this account, buy real estate, have some cash at hands. Even though US dollar is worthless to your eyes, it’s good and convenient to have some. Also remember your wife deserves it ! And if you have no wife yet and you are socially awkward like the rest of us, then maybe cashing out partially will help your situation ;)

**What the Private Banks expect.**
Joke aside, it is important you understand something. If you come around in Zurich to open a bank account and partially cash out, just don’t expect Private Banks will make an exception for you if you are small. You can’t ask them to facilitate your cash out, buy a 1m apartment with the proceeds of the sale, and not leave anything on your current account. It won’t work. Sadly, under 5m you are considered small in private banking. The bank is ok to let you open an account, provided that your kyc and compliance file are validated, but they will also want you to become a client and leave some money there to invest. This might me despicable, but I am just explaining you their rules.
If you want to cash out, you should sell enough to be comfortable and have some left.
Also expect the account opening to last at least 3-4 week if everything goes well. You can't just open an account overnight.

**The cash out logistics.**
Cashing out 1m USD a day in bitcoin or more is not so hard.

Let me just tell you this:
Even if you get a Tier 4 account with Kraken and ask Alejandro there to raise your limit over $100k per day,
Even if you have a bitfinex account and you are willing to expose your wealth there,
Even if you have managed to pass all the crazy due diligence at Bitstamp,

The amount should be fractioned to avoid risking your full wealth on exchange and getting slaughtered on the price by trading big quantities. Cashing out involves significant risks at all time. There is a security risk of compromising your keys, a counterparty risk, a fat finger risk. Let it be done by professionals. It is worth every single penny. 

Most importantly, there is a major difference between trading on an exchange and trading OTC. Even though it’s not publicly disclosed some exchange like Kraken do have OTC desks.
Trading on an exchange for a large amount will weight on the prices. Bitcoin is a thin market. In my opinion over 30% of the coins are lost in translation forever. Selling $10m on an exchange in a day can weight on the prices more than you’d think. And if you trade on a exchange, everything is shown on record, and you might wipe out the prices because on exchanges like bitstamp or kraken ultimately your counterparties are retail investors and the market depth is not huge. It is a bit better on Bitfinex.
It is way better to trade OTC.
Accessing the institutional OTC market is not easy, and that is also the reason why you should ask a regulated financial intermediary if we are talking about huge amounts.

Last point, always chose EUR as opposed to USD. EU correspondent banks won’t generally block institutional amounts. However we had the cases of USD funds frozen or delayed by weeks.

Most well-known OTC desks are [Cumberlandmining](https://cumberlandmining.com/) (ask for Lucas), [Genesis](https://genesistrading.com/) (ask for Martin), [Bitcoin Suisse AG] (https://www.bitcoinsuisse.ch/) (ask for Niklas), [circletrade](https://www.circletrade.com), [B2C2](https://www.b2c2.com/), or [Altcoinomy](http://www.beta.altcoinomy.com/) (ask for Olivier)


Very very large whales can also set up escrow accounts for massive block trades. This world, where blocks over 30k BTC are exchanged between 2 parties would deserve a reddit thread of its own. Crazyness all around.


**Your options: DIY or going through a regulated financial intermediary.**

Execution trading is a job in itself. You have to be patient, be careful not to wipe out the order book and place limit orders, monitor the market intraday for spikes or opportunities. At big levels, for a large cash out that may take weeks, these kind of details will save you hundred thousands of dollars. I understand crypto holders are suspicious and may prefer to do it by themselves, but there are regulated entities who now offer the services. 
Besides, being a crypto millionaire is not a guarantee you will get institutional daily withdrawal limits at exchange. You might, but it will take you another round of KYC with them, and surprisingly this round might be even more aggressive that the ones at Private banks since exchange have gone under intense scrutiny by regulators lately.

The fees for cashing out through a regulated financial intermediary to help you with your cash out should be around 1-2% flat on the nominal, not more. And for this price you should get the full package: execution/monitoring of the trades AND onboarding in a private bank. If you are asked more, you are being abused.

Of course, you also have the option to do it yourself. It is a way more tedious and risky process.
Compliance with the exchange, compliance with the private bank, trading BTC/fiat, monitoring the transfers…You will save some money but it will take you some time and stress. Further, if you approach a private bank directly, it will trigger a series of red flag to the banks. As I said in my previous post, they call a direct approach a “walk-in”. They will be more suspicious than if you were introduced by someone and won’t hesitate to show you high fees and load your portfolio with in-house products that earn more money to the banks than to you. Remember also most banks still do not understand crypto so you will have a lot of explanations to provide and you will have to start form scratch with them!

**The paradox of crypto millionaires**
Most of my clients who made their wealth through crypto all took massive amount of risks to end up where they are. However, most of them want their bank account to be managed with a low volatility fixed income capital preservation risk profile. This is a paradox I have a hard time to explain and I think it is mainly due to the fact that most are distrustful towards banks and financial markets in general. Many clients who have sold their crypto also have a cash-out blues in the first few months. This is a classic situation.  The emotions involved in hodling for so long, the relief that everything has eventually gone well, the life-changing dynamics, the difficulties to find a new motivation in life…All these elements may trigger a post cash-out depression. It is another paradox of the crypto rich who has every card in his hand to be happy, but often feel a bit sad and lonely.
Sometimes, even though it’s not my job, I had to do some psychological support. A lot of clients have also become my friends, because we have the same age and went through the same “ordeal”. First world problem I know…
Remember, cashing out is not the end. It’s actually the beginning. Don’t look back, don’t regret.
Cash out partially, because it does not make sense to cash out in full, regret it and want back in. relax.

**The race to cash out crypto billionaire and the concept of late exiter.**
The Winklevoss brothers are obviously the first of a series. There will be crypto billionaires. Many of them. At a certain level you can have a whole family office working for you to manage your assets and take care of your needs . However, let me tell you it’s is not because you made it so big that you should think you are a genius and know everything better than anyone. You should hire professionals to help you. Managing assets require some education around the investment vehicles and risk management strategies.
Sorry guys but with all the respect I have for r/wallstreebet,  AMD and YOLO stock picking,  some discipline is necessary.
The investors who have made money through crypto are generally early adopters. However I have started to see another profile popping up. They are not early adopters. They are late exiters. It is another way but just as efficient. Last week I met the first crypto millionaire I know who first bough bitcoin over 1000$. 55k invested at the beginning of this year. Late adopter & late exiter is a route that can lead to the million.



**Last remarks.**
I know banks, bankers, and FIAT currencies are so last century. I know some of you despise them and would like to have them burn to the ground.  With compliance officers taking over the business, I would like to start the fire myself sometimes. I hope this extensive guide has helped some of you. I am around if you need more details. I love my job despite all my frustration towards the banking industry because it makes me meet interesting people on a daily basis. I am a crypto enthusiast myself, and I do think this tech is here to stay and will change the world. Banks will have to adapt big time. Things have started to change already; they understand the threat is real. I can feel the generational gap in Geneva, with all these old bankers who don’t get what’s going on. They glaze at the bitcoin chart on CNBC in disbelief and they start to get it. This bitcoin thing is not a joke.
Deep inside, as an early adopter who also intends to be a late exiter, as a libertarian myself, it makes me smile with satisfaction.

Cheers.

XRP,Bitcoin,Is Ripple not something that Bitcoin should embrace? They are two very different things and theoretically share a symbiotic relationship.,"For those that don't know Ripple in a nutshell is a global currency exchange platform which is currency agnostic; its intent is not to be a currency but simply to facilitate the transition between currencies. 

Not too sure why some in the Bitcoin community have a natural aversion to the idea when it isn't even a competitor  and is seeking to be something else entirely.

XRP,Bitcoin,Ripple done right could have been more decentralized than Bitcoin,"**I do not think the system I propose below could in any way be a replacement of Bitcoin. It might be able to complement Bitcoin; I don't know. But at the very least it's an interesting framework to think about degrees of centralization and how a system could be even more decentralized than Bitcoin.**

Ripple is about exchanging IOUs. This requires trust. Your IOU for $10 is worth nothing to me if I don't believe that you will actually honor this IOU. With IOUs there is no double spending problem because you are not spending anything. You are in a sense creating money on the spot. This means there is no need for a global ledger. The only people who need to know that you owe me $10 are you and me.

Now if you owe me $10 and I owe someone else $10, my balance is $0 but I'm still liable for $10 to someone else. But if you  and ""someone else"" also know and trust each other, the system can propose to change this pair of IOUs into a single IOU directly from you to ""someone else"", after which I'm no longer liable.

If done right, I think this system could be what Ripple wanted to be, except completely decentralized.

Bitcoin is decentralized because its single global ledger is stored in many places. But an IOU system could be even more decentralized since there is no single ledger but everybody keeps track of their own ledger.",0,2015-04-19 11:54:46,10

XRP,Bitcoin,Ripple XRP is 35% more expensive than Bitcoins?,"I been following the Ripple Market, and I wanted to get your opinion, seams is getting very crazy lately.

At this time:

- XRP is been trading at BitStamp Marketplace on Ripple for about 55 XRP per USD ( $0.0185 per XRP )
- BTC is been trading at MtGox for about $122 per BTC

Given the amount of currency issues, the market cap for both currencies are:

- Ripple  : 100,000,000,000 * $0.0185 = $1,850,000,000
- Bitcoin :         11,168,000 * $122 =  $1,362,496,000

But what is more interesting is that if Ripple would have only 11,168,000 instead of 100 Billions, the price per unit will be: $165.65.- that is 35% more than Bitcoin.

The reason only I could think of, is the psychological reason about costing just pennies againt more than a hundred bucks... any other logical explanation for this?

Either Ripple is over valued, Bitcoin is undervalued or both.",0,2013-05-20 21:28:04,13

DON'T SEND BTC TO OLD BITSTAMP DEPOSIT ADDRESSES. New deposit addresses are fine. Up to 19,000 BTC were stolen. Bitstamp was suspended while they investigate, it has now resumed and everything is fine again. Bitstamp's announcement after re-opening is [here](https://www.bitstamp.net/article/bitstamp-is-open-for-business-better-than-ever/).

This was the first post on the issue, hence the uncertain title.

---

    [OP, Jan 5th 3am UTC]]

A few hours ago I made 2 deposits to Bitstamp. After lagging 7 confirmations behind on the blockchain, they each disappeared from the incoming transactions list WITHOUT updating my balance, which still sits at zero bitcoins. No transfers or sales have been made under the account and there is no indication that it's been compromised. Bitstamp haven't contacted me. Coins from one of the deposits has already been transferred to address https://blockchain.info/address/1JoktQJhCzuCQkt3GnQ8Xddcq4mUgNyXEa[1] which I assume belongs to Bitstamp. I've contacted support.

Has anyone else managed to deposit bitcoins there successfully in the last hour or so? Has anyone else had an issue? (I need to go now but if anyone else has, then it's an emergency. If not, then maybe it's just some crazy new KYC game of theirs).

Original post is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2rcybh/why_are_deposit_confirmations_so_lagged_on/

    [Edit (20 mins later)]

I've now told Bitstamp support about this post so they can comment here if/when everything is fine or provide updates on progress.

    [Edit (25 mins after OP)]

Bitstamp just sent out the following email.

> Dear customer,

> Today our transaction processing server detected problems with our hot wallet and stopped processing withdrawals.

> You should STOP SENDING bitcoin deposits to your Bitstamp account IMMEDIATELY as private keys of your deposit address may be lost.

> Your bitcoins already deposited with us are stored in a cold wallet and can not be affected.

> We will send you more info as soon as possible.

> Best regards,

> Bitstamp team

I still trust Bitstamp, but that's troubling wording right there. I trust Bitstamp will confirm ASAP that they'd cover any losses from what were blatantly *their* addresses and private keys. If so, kudos to them for doing the right thing and covering their own mistake. If not, then they just christened themselves ""Goxstamp"" and hung a big ""leave now or you'll only have yourself to blame"" sign over their exchange...

    [Update Jan 5th 10am UTC]

This has appeared on the Bitstamp website:

> BITSTAMP SERVICE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED

> We have reason to believe that one of Bitstamp’s operational wallets was compromised on January 4th, 2015.

> As a security precaution against compromises Bitstamp only maintains a small fraction of customer bitcoins in online system. Bitstamp maintains more than enough offline reserves to cover the compromised bitcoins.

> IN THE MEANTIME, PLEASE DO NOT MAKE DEPOSITS TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED BITCOIN DEPOSIT ADDRESSES. THEY CANNOT BE HONORED!

> Customer deposits made prior to January 5th, 2015 9:00 UTC are fully covered by Bitstamp’s reserves. Deposits made to newly issued addresses provided after January 5th, 2015 9:00 UTC can be honored.

> Bitstamp takes our security and soundness very seriously. In an excess of caution, we are suspending service as we continue to investigate. We will return to service and amend our security measures as appropriate.

> Bitstamp Team

It sounds like the cold wallet security was sound & that they plan on doing the right thing and covering any losses made from their wallet before the announcement. If so, I plan on continuing to use them.

    [Update Jan 5th 3-4pm UTC]

There is suspicion of a large theft, but nothing conclusive. It may be Bitstamp themselves doing housekeeping after the hack, but without info from them it's hard to tell: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2re2pw/18864_coins_stolen_from_stamp_that_doesnt_look/

Nearly all of my bitcoins from both deposits have now been transfered to the Bitstamp cold wallet, apparently as change in internal Bitstamp transactions, so it looks like *they've* not been stolen. Has anyone else affected traced their transaction?

According to [cryptocoinsnews](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-exchange-bitstamp-withdrawals-deposits-stopped-possible-rng-attack/) & [coinfire](https://coinfire.cf/2015/01/05/bitstamp-confirms-deposit-address-issue/), Bitstamp earlier thought it seemed to be a server issue and not a compromise.

---

    [Update Jan 5th 11pm UTC]

Bitstamp's CEO Nejc Kodrič has released the following statement:

> Bitstamp customers can rest assured that their bitcoins held with us as prior to temporary suspension of services on January 5th (at 9am UTC) are completely safe and will be honored in full.

> On January 4th, some of Bitstamp’s operational wallets were compromised, resulting in a loss of less than 19,000 BTC.  Upon learning of the breach, we immediately notified all customers that they should no longer make deposits to previously issued bitcoin deposit addresses.  As an additional security measure, we suspended our systems while we fully investigate the incident and actively engage with law enforcement officials.

> This breach represents a small fraction of Bitstamp’s total bitcoin reserves, the overwhelming majority of which are are held in secure offline cold storage systems. We would like to reassure all Bitstamp customers that their balances held prior to our temporary suspension of services will not be affected and will be honored in full.

> We appreciate customers’ patience during this disruption of services. We are working to transfer a secure backup of the Bitstamp site onto a new safe environment and will be bringing this online in the coming days. Customers can stay informed via updates on our website, on Twitter (@Bitstamp) and through Bitstamp customer support at support@bitstamp.net.""

    [Update Jan 6th 6pm UTC]

In [this Slovenian article](http://www.rtvslo.si/gospodarstvo/bitstampu-hekerji-ukradli-za-stiri-milijone-evrov-bitcoinov-borza-zacasno-zaprta/355142), Bitstamp co-founder Damijan Merlak has said what [some are interpreting ](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitstamp-resume-operations-next-24-hours/) as ""Bitstamp will reopen within 24 hours"", but it could possibly just mean a duplication of infrastructure within 24 hours, and resumption in service sometime after. Here's [one translation](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2ri6i5/bitstamp_damijam_merlak_currently_we_are_setting/cng6gyz) of the important bit:

> ""Bistamp remains liquid, but I can't tell more because of the investigation"" said co-founder Damijan Merlak and added they closed the exchange because otherwise ""important trails could be erased"". ""With experts we are currently setting up a duplicate of entire infrastructure in San Francisco, which is bound to finish in the next 24 hours. At that time we will continue our services."" explained Merlak for STA.

Here's [an autotranslation](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2ri6i5/bitstamp_damijam_merlak_currently_we_are_setting/cng3lgl):

> "" Bitstamp remains liquid, more because of the investigation itself difficult to tell , "" said co-founder Exchange Damijan Merlak , adding that the site stopped , "" because it is the continuation of the operation of the servers erase important tracks"" . "" Currently in San Francisco with experts put a duplicate of the entire infrastructure, which is expected to be regulated in the next 24 hours . Then we can restore service "" for clarification Merlak .

Hopefully they'll issue an update in English soon.

A prevailing theme in recent Bitstamp discussions is: What Did Bitstamp Know And When Did They Know It? I thought I should add my experience.

As described by [cryptocoinsnews](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-exchange-bitstamp-withdrawals-deposits-stopped-possible-rng-attack/) & [coinfire](https://coinfire.cf/2015/01/05/bitstamp-confirms-deposit-address-issue/), Bitstamp initially thought they had a server issue and not a compromise. When I sent my deposits to Bitstamp’s provided addresses, Bitstamp was 6-7 confirms behind in acknowledging the transfers to. It also then didn’t update the balance even after Bitstamp had itself acknowledged that the transfer to Bitstamp’s addresses had completed. It seems likely that Bitstamp made these changes  to their system to buy them some time while they investigated what they thought was the server issue.

If so, then they were already aware of a problem before that time, and chose not to suspend service or post any warning not to send Bitcoins to their transfer addresses...

XRP,Bitcoin,Ripple and ripple like systems will be what helps bitcoin from becoming centralized and highly regulated. Don't be fooled by thinking ripple is an evil system bent on replacing Bitcoin.,"There's a lot of negative posts on ripple lately and a lot of misconceptions about it's implementation.  There seems to be a group of posters both on bitcointalk.org and also here on /r/bitcoin that want to spin ripple as a competitor to bitcoin, and as an evil system that is centralized and controlled by OpenCoin.  When you see these posts, please examine how things are being spun and if what they are saying makes sense.  As most of us know, bitcoin will be at odds with the banking system, and the banking system would love to see it regulated and relegated to the dustbin of history.  So don't doubt that moneyed interests will seek to hire people to derail and spin topics of discussion to make things seem evil or good when they are just the opposite.

Here are a few misconceptions that I've seen spun to discount ripple:

* Ripple is closed source.

Ripple has multiple parts.  The key parts (the back end system) are currently open source and can be found on github.com.  OpenCoin has promised to make the front end system open source as well.

* Ripple is trying to replace Bitcoin.

Ripples (XRP's) will never be able to replace Bitcoin as a currency.  XRP's only use is to be consumed for transactions, just as a postage stamp is consumed when you mail a letter.  They exist to prevent spamming of the ripple network by imposing a small cost.  XRP's are not meant to be a currency, just as postage stamps are not meant to be a currency.  Those treating XRP's as a currency will probably lose money and be sorely disappointed when people refuse to offer products for XRP's.

* The value and supply of Ripples (XRP) is manipulated.

This can also be said of postage stamps, but that does not detract from the useful service that the U.S. postal service provides.  As long as the price per transaction is low enough the price of XRP's will not matter.  Currently the default transaction fee is .00001 XRP (or 100K transactions per 1 XRP).  If the price of one XRP is $.01 ($1 billion market cap on XRP's), then the transaction fees are still practically free.  The price per XRP is un-important to everyone except those foolish enough to treat it as a currency.  If OpenCoin is ever foolish enough to make the price of transactions to high, the code is open source and developers will be able to transition the system away from XRP.

* Ripple is a scam.

""Ripplin"" is a multi level marketing scheme (a type of legalized pyramid scheme/scam) that is capitalizing on the term ""ripples"".  Ripplin is not Ripple.  Ripple is not scam.  However, those treating XRP as a type of currency may view OpenCoin's reserves of XRP as manipulation or a scam.  To those who do this, I would say ""You're doing it wrong.""

* Ripple.com is centralized.

This is deceptive because it does not describe the distributed back end system being created to facilitate more sites than just ripple.com.  Just because ripple.com is the only site currently running the software does not mean others will do the same.  Multiple ripple sites running the ripple software will be able to connect to the distributed network to take advantage of the ripple accounting system.

* Ripple is a debt based system.

This is deceptive because it implies that ripple is replicating the current fiat based fractional reserve system where money is debt.  Ripple is more clearly an account clearing system showing who owes who, and the trust relationships between those participating in the ripple trust system.

XRP,Bitcoin,What the hell is ripple and how can I use it to fund my bitstamp account?,"So I am trying to get money from the usa to my bitstamp account faster than with a wire. Is this a viable alternative? I thought ripple was another digital currency but apparently it is quite different.

This is the response I got when inquiring about this process - 

The easiest way is to deposit USD to your SnapSwap account, get XRP on the same day and send them direct to your Bitstamp account in USD. Alternatively, you can sell XRP for USD:bitstamp on open market and deposit USD:bitstamp into your Bitstamp account.

Or you can buy BTC in the Ripple network and send them to your Bitstamp account or to any other Bitcoin address.

This looks really ugly. This is an obvious hit piece from Ripple labs on Stellar and JedMcaleb. You cannot make it more trashy than that. Personally I don't care so much for Stellar vs Ripple labs even though I prefer Stellar planned distribution of coins. 

But I think this is the same angle they are going to use against Bitcoin. Their message is: This is the platform of the terrorists, we are the nice guys and we are with the banks and the government. Quite shameful...

I think at some point in the future, people might have to take sides on this. Sure Ripple and Bitcoin are different things, but I have noticed in recent months some hit on Bitcoin from the Ripple people in the media. They look really dirty.

Decentralized. With pegging to national fiat currencies as an on/off toggle in every bitcoin wallet. And 0 latency.

XRP,Bitcoin,"I’ll never own 1 BTC, and that’s okay","I don’t have 1 bitcoin, and I never will. Back in 2017, I first heard about Bitcoin when it was all over the news. I had just started working, and with a bit of FOMO, I bought a tiny amount—right at the ATH of the time. After that, I didn’t really think about it much.

Fast forward to 2020, I saw an opportunity during the summer dip. I made a lot of transactions trying to figure out the best way to store it, and in the process, I lost a decent amount. Still, I managed to buy an amount I was comfortable with. Over time, I took out my initial investment along with some profit, which helped fund my move to a new place.

I’ve been through the ups and downs of this market, and even now, I still feel FOMO sometimes. “What if I had just...”

\---

Every number between 0 cents and the current ATH has been, by definition, the all-time-high at one point. Don't let that prevent you from taking a risk in something you believe in. Extend your time horizon to a decade and lock your coins away.

\---

I've been a libertarian since I was a teenager. The expanding role of the State is something that I've been worrying about for most of my life. While learning about the immorality of the existence of the State, at some point I learned about monetary policy and how inflation is robbing everyone on an unprecedented scale. I tucked this knowledge away and was determined to figure out a way around it when I started making my own money. (This paragraph is the only one involving political philosophy, go ahead and continue reading)

I first heard of Bitcoin in 2010 on one of the many forums I frequented in my libertarian internet circle. It was an interesting concept to me, but I didn't pursue it at all. Again I tucked this knowledge away for future use.

I heard of it again several months later (2010). This time I decided to try it out. I remember downloading and syncing the reference wallet and using a BTC faucet to send coins to my wallet. I forget exactly how many it was... 5, maybe? That's as far as I went with it though. At some point I deleted the wallet and the downloaded blockchain - probably to make room for a Steam game or something. Those coins are gone.

That's right - Steam. I have been a gamer for most of my life as well. I owned a powerful graphics card at the time: The Radeon 5970.

The third time I heard about Bitcoin was in May 2011. I had heard that the price was lifting off and people were making a lot of money from it. This time I decided to dive in and see what I could figure out.

This was where I fell into the deep rabbit hole of Bitcoin. I remember getting so absorbed in it that I didn't sleep some nights. I was working my day job, going home and learning all that I could about Bitcoin. Learning about how addresses were generated, how wallets worked, how mining worked, how the difficulty adjustment worked, everything that I possibly could.

After a week or two of obsessing and reading about Bitcoin, I decided that this was the most important invention since the internet - the most perfect form of money ever created. One of the most ingenious systems ever designed by man - and NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT IT YET.

I can't recall if any other coins existed at the time, but between 2011-2012 I remember other coins like Namecoin, Peercoin, Feathercoin, and some others. I don't hear about any of those other coins these days... besides LTC and XRP, of course.

I decided that I wanted in. I needed to get some Bitcoin. I needed it NOW!! This would be like buying stock in the Internet itself but better - no counterparty risk, and I could be my own bank!

I wasn't making a lot of money at the time, so putting money towards anything discretionary wasn't going to be friendly to my budget. Yes, I owned a badass gaming rig, but that was my only luxury in life. I knew I was going to buy for the long term, so I decided to put aside $500 and go for it. I was going to buy Bitcoin.

At the time, Mt Gox was the only game in town that I can remember. I don't think BTC-e existed yet, or maybe I just hadn't heard of it.

I signed up for a Gox account and figured out how to fund it. There were a few ways to do this, one of which was another app called Dwolla. So I signed up for Dwolla and got verified. I then deposited my $500 and initiated the ACH transfer to Gox. BTC price at the time: $3.

I had initiated the transfer on a Tuesday evening after work. I was informed that the transfer would arrive at Gox on Friday.

I watched agonizingly as the price climbed hour after hour, day after day. $3.50. $4. $5. $6. I was missing the boat!!! By Thursday evening the price had doubled.

At work on Friday, I checked my email on my phone practically every five minutes. The transfer didn't go through the entire work day. I had plans with friends that evening - damn it, I was going to have to try and do this on my phone while hanging with my friends?!

I ended up making my first BTC purchase while sitting in a movie theater. I bought 50 Bitcoin for $10 each - during an all-time-high.

I still hodl every one of these coins today.

(The movie, for the curious: X-Men: First Class)

I couldn't stop there, though. The more I learned, the more I had to know. The more I had to DO. That's when I got into GPU mining.

This was a time before ASICs. I believe GPU mining was relatively new -- before this, miners were only using CPUs (which were in 2011 -- like GPUs in 2020 -- obsolete for SHA256 mining).

The next day I dove headfirst into Bitcoin mining. I downloaded the software and set up an account on Slush Pool. I ran my 5970 on full blast for a while and went out with some friends. When I got back, my bedroom was noticeably hotter than it was when I left. So that's what I was going to be dealing with? Ok, fine.

I also couldn't play any demanding video games while the miner was running. I'd have to dial the hashrate down, or disable it completely. Ok, I guess I can manage that.

After a few days of dealing with that, I decided to buy another 5970. If I got bored of Bitcoin, it would still make The Witcher 2 run better!

All told, between mining with Slush Pool and BTCGuild for a month, I managed to mine an additional 50BTC that month.

I still hodl every one of these coins today.

One day, my electric bill came. $350. For my 1BR apartment? That can't be right...

I called up the electric company and told them they double-billed me.

""Nope, that amount is accurate. That's what you owe for this month. Have a nice day!""

And that was the day I stopped Bitcoin mining.

I had been telling all my friends and gamer friends about Bitcoin the entire time. They laughed at me. I told them they wouldn't be laughing when I was a millionaire.

Soon after, Bitcoin crashed -- HARD. Dropping from $32 at its peak to $2 over the next few months -- one of the largest price drops in its history.

I was dejected. I stopped talking about it with my friends. The gamer communities I was a member of made fun of me relentlessly, trashing Bitcoin every day. News articles celebrating Bitcoin's death popped up everywhere. It was the first major public crash, and I felt all alone.

I uninstalled the Bitcoin price widget from my phone. I moved on with my life and tried to forget about Bitcoin. I left the wallet on my PC, but deleted my copy of the blockchain.

I barely thought about Bitcoin for the next two years. Any time someone brought it up at work or in my friend group, I changed the subject. I was completely demoralized and thought I had fallen for the biggest scam of all time.

After this unbearable TWO YEAR period... Bitcoin came back.

One day I opened r/Bitcoin and saw utter elation all over the front page. What the hell was going on?

Bitcoin had surpassed the last all-time-high and was climbing still. $50... $100. And it was still going!!!

I snapped out of my multi-year funk right then and there. Somehow my paper financial loss had clouded my judgment and made me forget about the fundamentals that made me interested in Bitcoin in the first place.

""Bitcoin was back?"" It had never left. It was still the same decentralized, unforgeable, instantly transferrable miracle asset that I had fallen in love with.

I got back into mining again, but I didn't leave my GPUs running 24/7 like I had before. Eventually, ASICs started coming out and obsoleted GPU miners, so I had to start mining LTC instead and selling them for BTC. I mined on a site called give-me-ltc and did my trades on BTC-e.

Eventually I got tired of managing my miners, paying extra for electricity, and dealing with switching stuff around for gaming. I stopped mining again and moved on to other things.

I exited this phase with an additional 30BTC and over 400LTC. I still hodl every one of these coins today.

Eventually, BTC hit $1000. I watched this live on [bitcoinity.org](https://bitcoinity.org). I remember this day vividly.

The graphic shown on bitcoinity for every price point was usually some sort of funny gif - someone dancing, someone acting crazy, someone making a funny face, Mr. Bean watching signposts fly past his car. This time, the gif was different - it was serious.

It was an astronaut on the moon. A flag was planted behind him bearing the Bitcoin logo.

Tears welled up in my eyes. This was significant. Bitcoin was being recognized for what it was - the most perfect form of money ever created.

My stack was now worth enough to pay off all of my six-figure student loan debt. I had thought that I would be paying this debt off for the rest of my life. Bitcoin meant potential financial freedom to me.

I didn't sell a single satoshi.

Of course, $1000 didn't last, and paying off all my loans with my stack was no longer a possibility. The price did not recover for almost FOUR years -- even longer than the previous crypto winter. During this time I bought a few more coins through Coinbase.

The 2017 run-up was a blur -- except for one day...

The day I became a crypto millionaire.

My family didn't grow up with a ton of money. I never had the latest clothes, toys -- well, anything. We weren't poor, but we scraped by. I didn't have a great education in personal finance.

Being a crypto millionaire went straight to my head.

Driving to work on that day, I remember thinking I was the most badass person on Earth. Somehow I had managed to manipulate some computer numbers around that were now worth over a million dollars!!

I couldn't help it - I told everyone at work. I was a crypto millionaire. I couldn't shut up about it. I told my family. I told my friends. I told everyone.

I went to the store to grab a few things. Walking the aisles, I couldn't stop thinking about it. ""These people have no idea they're standing next to a MILLIONAIRE.""

Of course, my crypto millionaire status didn't last long.

This time, though, I SODL a few coins at the peak. I bought a house and a car.

A month or two later, I was no longer a crypto millionaire.

Seeing the altcoin season was kind of crazy to me. For a few months, you literally could not pick a losing coin. Everyone was a winner. It was sheer insanity. I picked up a few ETH to get some exposure, even though I didn't (and still don't) believe in it long term.

I'm doing pretty well these days. I am numb to any price activity at this point. The last time I bought was the dip down to $4000 in March. I don't know how anyone could have resisted that one.

Other than what I SODL in 2017, I still hodl all of my coins.

You may be able to see a pattern here. There's always going to be another all-time-high. There's always going to be a crash or a correction. You're probably going to feel stupid more than a handful of times being a HODLer. But eventually these feelings go away.

I have a few more anecdotes and random thoughts to share, so I'll make them bullet points below:

&#x200B;

\- I held on to my BCH for a while. I will admit that I was TERRIFIED during the flippening. 6-12 months later, I sold them all for BTC.

\- I immediately sold all my BSV for LTC.

\- I hold BTC, LTC, and ETH. That's it.

\- I don't believe in any of these centralized or ""new and improved"" shitcoins. I'm a BTC maximalist through-and-through. The only other coin I'd consider at this point would be Monero. I know almost nothing about it and I haven't done any research on it, so I don't hold any.

&#x200B;

FUNNY

\- I gave $5 of BTC to a friend in 2013. They forgot about it. I reminded them about it this year. They sold it for $175.

\- I gave $30 of BTC to a friend in 2013. They sold it in 2017 for $750.

\- I solo mined IxCoin (literal who?) for a few days because I wanted to feel what it was like to solo mine a block. I did not solo mine a block.

\- My favorite Bitcoin meme is ""This is gentlemen."" Why don't people say that anymore?

&#x200B;

REMINISCING

\- Wallets I used: Bitcoin core -> Armory Offline (airgapped with TAILS) -> Electrum Offline (airgapped with TAILS) -> trezor

\- Armory was flaky as fuck. I moved on to Electrum after the 20th time Armory failed to sync the blockchain. I remember having to manually export the private keys using some Python script because I couldn't get the wallet synced.

\- Reddit is too slow for BTC sometimes, so I would go to the BTC-e trollbox to get some realtime action. Now that BTC-e is gone, I typically hang out in /biz/ when Reddit is boring.

&#x200B;

REGRETS

\- Not buying more. Not mining more.

\- Not selling BCH for BTC immediately. That one still stings.

\- Focusing a little too much on paying down debt vs buying more BTC.

\- Buying precious metals in 2013. What a waste.

\- Selling in 2017. But, I wanted a house and a car. Regretting taking profit is stupid, but I can't help it.

&#x200B;

THOUGHTS

\- I never once tried to convince anyone to buy Bitcoin, despite how much I talked about it. I tried to convince people of the potential and that the Fed was evil, but I never once said, ""You should buy Bitcoin"" to anyone.

\- I see another 10x for BTC. Just buy BTC. Don't buy anything else. Just buy BTC and fucking HODL.

\- HODL through these crashes. They make you stronger. After a few of them, nothing will faze you. Be a fucking man and HODL on to your coins!!!!!

\- People just don't understand the network effect of the BTC protocol. No one cares that another coin has better features. No one cares that there are better internet protocols. They use what has the most infrastructure and support. Don't fall for these shitcoins.

\- People don't understand the layering concept. Increasing blocksize simply isn't the solution to scaling Bitcoin - second layer and beyond is the solution.

\- Taxation is theft.

&#x200B;

Hopefully this was at least mildly entertaining.

Happy New Year!!!!!

XRP,Bitcoin,My dad keept borrowing an unreasonable amount of money so I put some into BTC,"So my dad keeps borrowing money from me (16y/o male) and he just reached 2k debt to me. He hasnt repaid anything in the last 6 months and keeps borrowing more for pretty unimportant projects he has in mind. I had some BTC back then that he never touched because he just couldnt use it. While yall have btc to save your money from inflation, I have btc to save my money from my dad lmao. Dont worry, we are on good terms with eachother. I only have like 300 USD in BTC but I thought this is a funny story to share.

XRP,Bitcoin,Proof that BTC38 takes CNY for BTC/LTC/XRP etc.. (Photo in context),"Hey guys, my friend is from mainland china and was able to help me investigate BTC38.com's acceptance of CNY for BTC.. LTC.. etc. 

Sorry I couldn't provide you guys with a translated screenshot but it's a screenshot of the site once I logged in nonetheless. 

In the screenshot you'll see a green box where it asks me to set up which chinese bank I am dealing with to deposit CNY with. If anyone could edit my screenshot for translation, you've already got my upvote. 

Anyway, screenshot for proof is here:

I hope this helps. 

Cheers. 

*** Ps. If anyone would like to use my screenshots for any publication, article or report, you can request for permission for its use on Reddit by sending me a private message. Thank you. ***

** I am gonna attempt to deposit CNY into my BTC38.com account for BTC or LTC. I will update this post regularly... please refresh for updates **

1. I'm entering how many CNY I wanna add (20 CNY for now... incase the cny feds take it!): http://puu.sh/5Ryp2.png

2. Here's the bank selection screen.. like most online banking sites in the west: http://puu.sh/5Ryq8.png

3. I'm now gonna enter security details here to complete transaction: http://puu.sh/5Ryr7.png

4. I'm installing security software because I can't log into the bank account without that little USB account authentication thing.. that's unique to the chinese bank I'm using. 

5. So I authenticated and my CNY deposit was successful: http://puu.sh/5RyVX.png

6. I went ahead and bought Litecoin (LTC): http://puu.sh/5Rz4a.png

**I think we have success. By the way, I live in North America eh?  ;-) **



Edit: **To be clear, this is about depositing. Not withdrawing.**
Edit 2: I wrote ""withdraw"" in the context that people can directly withdraw from their bank accounts to the exchange, for further clarification. I have edited the above text to say ""deposit CNY"" to prevent further confusion.

# Why don’t we take a look at the math?

&#x200B;

[Bitcoin's Supply Formula](https://preview.redd.it/uczbuwzaw7da1.jpg?width=916&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98c116120924f4e073abd11ab4666ac0f34efc9c)

Let me start by explaining this in an easier way

We are gonna multiply the number of blocks (210,000) by the number of coins each new block should print (50) which itself, will be divided by 2 which will be to the power of n, n being the halving we are at. So if we know that 2⁰=1, 2¹=2, 2²=4, and so on, we could conclude that 50/2⁰ = 50/1 = 50, 50/2¹ = 50/2 = 25, and so on, which all on itself means that at no halving we have 210,000 blocks adding 50 Bitcoin to the supply and at the first halving we have 210K new blocks adding 25 and so on.

***So, let's do this manually***

We are gonna start at 0 halvings

***210,000 \* (50 / 2⁰) = 10,500,000***

*Supply so far= 10,500,000*

As you can see, we already have the first half of the whole supply, may we reach 21M soon?

Lets see, why don't we add the first halving to the supply?

***210,000 \* (50 / 2¹) = 5,250,000***

*Supply so far= 15,750,000* \[which is the result of: 10,500,000 + 5,250,000\]

Wait, this is not the same, this is half of what we initially got, what if we add another halving to the supply? We might get closer

**2100,00 \* (50 / 2²) = 2,625,000**

*Supply so far= 18,375,000*  \[15,750,000+2,625,000\]

Ok, so we are getting closer, but at the same time we can't reach the goal, we have in Bitcoin's supply an example of the [Zeno's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes) where whenever you get to the half of a goal you can only move the half of the remaining distance.

After halving 32 we will arrive at a supply of 20,999,999.9769 Bitcoin, not 21M as we were promised but pretty close, we could continue doing this until the 32nd halving (the last one), but then this post would be too long, so here's a simple [Bitcoin Supply Calculator](https://github.com/ndsvw/Bitcoin-Supply-Calculator) for you to use.

&#x200B;

# Now that we have the math all figured out, let's check the code

&#x200B;

I won't enter too much into details here because I've never been that good with code, but I'll do my best to explain this as humanly as I can.

&#x200B;

[Block of code enforcing 50\/2ⁱ](https://preview.redd.it/5i5x2gefw7da1.png?width=1659&format=png&auto=webp&s=32df70e806e58786d384a0179e41bf609b8a77c5)

    CAmount nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;

What this line does is multiplying the number of the parameter COIN by 50, COIN being a binary representation of 100,000,000 which is number of Sats, the smallest unit the Bitcoin Network recognizes and the smallest divisible unit of a Bitcoin, being this number in binary: *100101010000001011111001000000000.*

&#x200B;

    nSubsidy >>= halvings;

This line is a “bitwise right shift” all it does is an arithmetic shift to the right by one bit, or simply put, divides by two in binary.

What this does is taking the number *100101010000001011111001000000000* and remove the last number of bits, being the numbers of bits, the same number of the halving we are at the moment, for this example imagine you have a dot at the end of the number and everything that moves after said dot is removed.

If nSubsidy is 0 our binary number stays the same

*100101010000001011111001000000000 = 5,000,000,000 units of COIN*

If nSubsidy is 1, we move one bit to the right, we remove the last bit by moving the whole number one space to the right, the last 0 being now after the dot and the rest of the number before it.

*10010101000000101111100100000000* (you can count the 0 if you want)*= 2,500,000,000 units of COIN*

If nSubsidy is 3, which is the halving we are at at the time of writing then we move 3 bits

*100101010000001011111001000000 = 625,000,000 units of COIN*This all the way to 32 where we end up we only 1 bit, and after that comes nothing before the hypothetical dot.

&#x200B;

    if (halvings >=64) return 0;

Is a [bug fix](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3842), the wont be 64 halvings, it just ensures that if for any reason we ever go above 64 halvings the block subsidy forces itself to 0.

&#x200B;

[Block of code enforcing an interval of 210K blocks for every reduction of the subsidy](https://preview.redd.it/jq8sqtliw7da1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c28f0f8606be4ecf5e86eea4c26b2a0e652e88c)

    consensus.nSubsidyHalvingInterval = 210000;

This line simply ensures the halving happens every 210,000 blocks.

&#x200B;

If you want a more detailed explanation you could check [Unchained Capital's post about it](https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-source-code-21-million/).

&#x200B;

>But they can update the code to remove the limit

There's a [whole book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57429394-the-blocksize-war) on how a group of people tried to double the size of the blocks every two years and they couldn't, all they did was fork the network and now it's [being delisted by one of the biggest exchanges](https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/11/30/coinbase-delisting-xrp-bitcoin-cash-ethereum-classic-low-usage-wallet-crypto-winter/) for the lack of users. Nobody with at least two fingers of forehead will move to a version of Bitcoin where inflation is re-introduced when we all know the consequences of inflation.

XRP,Bitcoin,Do you guys think Bitcoin will replace gold as reserve asset?,"The vast majority of society rejects Bitcoin as a legitimate asset, if I went around my town asking 1000 people whether they favor of Bitcoin or not, I would only expect maybe 1 to say they favor it. Even if I were to explain to them that BlackRock considers it a legitimate asset, and that Larry Fink was quoted saying ""It is an asset class that protects you"" and ""it is for those who are fearful of their geopolitical risks or their own risks"", they would still consider it a fraud. It is as if it has been hardwired into their brains that BTC is rubbish internet money. Upon doing more research, I found out that a Rothschild linked bank, Edmond de Rothschild Group holds a small sum of $3.6m worth of ETFs. This is a small amount, but I recon this is huge news because the Rothschild family holds great influence and are some of the most powerful amongst the British political elites. This shows that some of the rich elites acknowledges BTC as a legitimate asset and certainly do not consider it as rubbish internet money. I think it is very clear that institutions and the rich elites are beginning to publicly acknowledge BTC as an asset. If institutions are starting to support BTC, then the public will follow. If the political class are starting to acknowledge it then eventually nation states will follow their command and accumulate BTC. 

Now this begs the trillion dollar question, will Bitcoin replace gold as a global reserve asset? To be completely honest, despite being a huge Bitcoin fan I have my doubts and I believe this is the most difficult goal to accomplish. Together with you guys, I wholeheartedly hope that the end game of Bitcoin is to be the worlds safest, most valuable, incorruptible and divisible asset. Completely and entirely replace Gold as reserve asset, causing it to be shunned as a relic of the past and be increasingly viewed as imperfect.

There are a few advantages which Bitcoin has over gold.   
- Supply and creation of Bitcoin is predetermined, this is to ensure consistency and scarcity, which gold is inferior to because there may be undiscovered gold deposits or asteroids that increases supply suddenly. Some argue that Bitcoin is a fraud because it is man-made, but lets put that in a different perspective. Bitcoin being an invention created by mankind makes it superior and more reliable, this is because the technology can be perfected to possess all good attributes of gold and none of the disadvantages. As science and technology advances, human beings have always borrowed ideas from nature (i.e. gold) and perfecting it for our own use. This is part of human ingenuity.

- Bitcoin is easily transferrable and the transactions are easily verifiable. Imagine some countries trading with each other in massive volumes, if they used Bitcoin, the amounts received would take less than a day, regardless of where they are situated around the globe. However, with gold it would take weeks and months to receive the metals and check every one of these bars. You see, gold is very inefficient and very ancient. 

- Bitcoin is more secure than gold, as mentioned earlier the transactions are efficient and nearly impossible to track down. In times of geopolitical conflict Bitcoin would be preferred over gold because gold transports or shipments can be tracked down and seized whereas Bitcoin can be safely transferred within the highly secure network. This is a bit far fetched but it illustrates the point that Bitcoin is safer, more secure and faster. 

- Bitcoin is more versatile, it is widely used on the internet market, for any purposes and any transactions where the user hopes for security. This means Bitcoin is suitable for everyone, whereas gold just sits there and taking up massive storage space. The thing that's worse about gold is that it doesn't increase in value quite as often despite being heavy and inefficient. Bitcoin is soaking up the fiat currency at much greater volumes than gold. The returns of gold are far too inferior and we should seriously reconsider gold as a store of value. If gold possessed the same qualities of Bitcoin, it would have 100 trillion dollar market cap today, its because of their limitations that their price is suppressed. $2000 per ounce of gold is a joke in today's money, for context, those who bought certain stocks decades ago would made far greater returns than gold. 

Now despite these comparisons, gold still retains its historical place as a reserve asset for thousands of years. In times of political uncertainty, the rich elites and nation states are accumulating gold instead of Bitcoin. I think it is difficult to tell whether Bitcoin can replace gold because we are still too early. Ask in town, your friends or colleagues about Bitcoin and they will think its a fraud, this means we are early, and Bitcoins are still cheap. I think it will require tremendous political and public support for Bitcoin to dethrone gold as reserve asset, this is the end game and seems far too difficult but only time will tell. Even if Bitcoin doesn't dethrone gold, it will certainly beat silver and the market cap of major stocks, and at the very least be second to gold.

XRP,Bitcoin,"bitcoin, XLM, XRP - is Jed McCaleb Satoshi Nakamoto? Why I think so","I have been invested in Cryptocurrency for the past six months. Over this time, I have formed the opinion that the cryptos with the greatest intrinsic value are Stellar Lumens and Ripple. Also, I believe that these are two of the only coins that - in the long run - could thrive if bitcoin crashes (Short term bitcoin pull backs = large decrease in ALL altcoin price/per as we have seen this past week). The technology these coins possess and the service they provide almost conflict with the idea of bitcoin, right? Benefiting banks and large corporations by eliminating (maybe too strong of a word) the need-for/purpose of a decentralized currency.

Bitcoin was created to serve as a peer to peer exchange, however, many will argue that most of bitcoins’ founding principles have been thrown out the window. 

Early in the history of bitcoin, Satoshi basically stated that he did not like the direction bitcoin was heading, and that he was moving on to other things. 

And that’s exactly what Jed McCaleb did.

Surely, one cannot assume that this Satoshi figure only created bitcoin, and then was never to be heard from again. No, a genius like that does not have just one jackpot invention. 

That being said, Jed McCaleb created eDonkey in the year 2000, Mt. Gox, Ripple, and Stellar, all of which (besides stellar) provide(d) a revolutionary service. Is it that crazy to assume this was the same man who created bitcoin?



I would love to hear any thoughts on this theory that Jed McCaleb is Satoshi Nakamoto

If you are fortunate enough to make a or have made a ton of money in Bitcoin, you need to understand why so many lottery winners end up broke. They have little to no idea on how to manage money.

Making a lot of money is not the same as managing a lot of money; People screaming about lambo's and how they want this and that, it's a stupid way to go about receiving the beautiful gift of bitcoin.

Avoid liabilities, gain assets.

If Bitcoin teaches you anything, be weary about spending tons of your money on things that can be replicated. Cars, clothes, tv's, computers. They won't make you happier.

During this journey everybody should be learning on how to gain, and hold onto wealth.

Edit: apparently the statistic isn't correct. Some news spewing it around. Credit to u/itsnotlupus for pointing it out (Also happy cake day).

XRP,Bitcoin,Ripple XRP is 35% more expensive than Bitcoins?,"I been following the Ripple Market, and I wanted to get your opinion, seams is getting very crazy lately.

At this time:

- XRP is been trading at BitStamp Marketplace on Ripple for about 55 XRP per USD ( $0.0185 per XRP )
- BTC is been trading at MtGox for about $122 per BTC

Given the amount of currency issues, the market cap for both currencies are:

- Ripple  : 100,000,000,000 * $0.0185 = $1,850,000,000
- Bitcoin :         11,168,000 * $122 =  $1,362,496,000

But what is more interesting is that if Ripple would have only 11,168,000 instead of 100 Billions, the price per unit will be: $165.65.- that is 35% more than Bitcoin.

The reason only I could think of, is the psychological reason about costing just pennies againt more than a hundred bucks... any other logical explanation for this?

Either Ripple is over valued, Bitcoin is undervalued or both.",0,2013-05-20 21:28:04,13

I submitted a question to their customer service team that said:

""Hey there, are you planning on exchanging/selling ripples soon? I think you guys are close to each other in SF, right? 

Thanks in advance, take care :)""

To which Fred kindly replied:

""Hi,

We do know the ripple guys. You never know :)

Regards,

At the risk of posting a ""cool story bro"", I figured /r/bitcoin might be interested in the hint of a collaboration like this.  Not conclusive by any means, though still an exciting idea.  Neither company is terrible huge yet but a collaboration between the 2 would be a great push for ripple and a unique attribute for coinbase.  AFAIK, there are no currency exchanges that work with multiple alt currencies. 

Maybe an exchange that works with many alt currencies would be strong.

Maybe decentralized currencies will become greatly diversified and there will be a need to exchange between them quickly, easily, and often. 


If you would be interested in coinbase working with Ripple, hit them up too!  I think this would be a fantastic move!",5,2013-02-12 00:05:01,7

Told them that there is a couple bucks worth of BTC on each wallet. I told them to put it somewhere safe and one day, when the time is right to them, pull it out and use it. Some looked at me like I am nuts, some thanked me, some have been asking me questions everyday since. Some have asked me how to get the money off, I tell them ""you have to figure it out for yourself"" every time I get a question I tell them to try to learn how to answer it themselves. It's been fun. 

&#x200B;

It has certainly gotten 15 new people intrigued, started a lot of conversation and two of them have gone down the rabbit hole hard, one sending me links at 11:30 pm on Sat night ""Check this out"" with a link. I love it.

XRP,Bitcoin,Why Bitcoin remains and will remain the most valuable crypto currency.,"With new comers into this space everyday, there's a lot to learn. One of the common questions is why is Bitcoin the most popular cryptocurrency? What gives it value over others despite the fees and speed?

I started typing this as a reply and then realised it probably should be its own post.

There are many factors why Bitcoin remains popular despite the competition, some more obvious than others.

1. First. Being the first means it has the strongest network effect. The Bitcoin name is on the news regularly, this is free marketing and has become widely known. Any newer crypto will have a hard time to compete for this air time.


2. Solid fundamentals. The other networks are either under used, hence why fees are low. Or the claims made by other networks regarding improvements over Bitcoin come at a compromise of one or more of Bitcoin's strengths.


3. Decentralisation. No company or people are in charge of Bitcoin so it can't be sued or taken down). And the rules can't change at the whim of an influential leader. This gives Investors long term confidence and predictability of its Blockchain rules.


4. Security. The Bitcoin network has by far the highest POW hashrate, keeping the network secure from attacks. 


5. Fixed supply. The 21million Bitcoin cap makes it rare, super rare actually compared to most other networks. 


6. No pre-mine. A lot of cryptocurrencies have been pre-mined by their founders (such as the 70% premine of Ethereum, or XRP created 100billion tokens at launch). This should be a red alert as makes distribution unfair enriching the founders. Premines are not something that gets talked about lately but creation of tokens out of thin air is what central banks do today and what proof of work fights. If something takes effort to do, it should have more value than a pre created token.


7. Deflationary. The shrinking supply of Bitcoin over 4 year halvings, whith increasing demand is a moon recipe. 

Each one of the above could be further expanded but I hope this makes it a little clearer. 

If the only priority was speed and cheap transactions, why reinvent Paypal? 

Said this, the Lightning Network is currently in the Beta stage and is being refined to provide just that. Bitcoin cheap and fast transactions already exist in wallets supporting LN, such as Phoenix, Breez and Blue wallet.

Nope, governments were never going to make it that easy. Crypto will have its day in the sun, but that day is not today. 

***

I have seen things. Don't ask me how. My dreams can be cryptic.

The destruction of fiat has already begun in earnest, but we're only in the 1st inning. The next 10 years will be characterized by the destruction of the USD, and the rise of the Chinese yuan backed by gold.

Gold and crypto are the two twin pillars that will destroy fiat. Thanks to crypto we're looking at a resurfacing of a global consciousness and desire for a non-state backed currency, harkening back to the days of a gold-backed money supply. Throughout history, empires have risen and fallen. The strongest empire's currency has always been the choice reserve currency of that era, but as an empire grows complacent and the government officials decadent, so does the temptation to debase their currency. The privilege of being the reserve currency globally gives them a sunset period of 20-40 years as the inevitable decline happens. It all began when Nixon took the USD off the gold standard.

Both China and Russia has been quietly accumulating gold over the past 10 years, restricting exports and increasing imports of gold. China is the world's largest oil importer and is in the process of switching over from paying for oil in USD to yuan, and redeemable into gold. The ramifications are massive. Increasingly the world is turning back on the US and its currency.

China is clamping down on cryptocurrency heavily as it interferes with their grand plan: they plan to shock the world in 2019 by announcing that they will go back to a partial gold-backed standard. Not fully-backed due to constraints in monetary policy advised by their Chinese economists, but sufficiently so such that the world gains confidence in the yuan and central banks globally begin selling their USD in earnest from the current 60%+ weighting, demoting it to a 30%+ weighting in favour of yuan as it dawns on them the USD might have just lost its reserve currency status. In this chaos, as we see across all regime changes, central banks begin buying gold in earnest. Other countries respond by backing their currency with gold as well. China becomes the new global superpower.

Thanks to this, the gold price will move to all-time highs and start trading above $2k in 2019. This will see the beginning of a gold rush we've never seen before. Old and institutional money begins to pour into precious metals; new and speculative money pours into cryptos. Cryptos enter into a final blow-off-top a year later not unlike the 2000 tech top in 2020. Bitcoin crashes 70% from $1m to $300K. As this happens, the whole world goes all-in into gold and yuan as the new safe havens as this is simultaneously accompanied by a major sell-off across both equities and bond markets. The rout will not stop till the mid 2020s. Gold is now trading at $7k/oz and silver at $200/oz. In fact, gold, as is most asset classes, are no longer quoted in USD but yuan. Africa begins to wield significant influence in the global political arena with South Africa leading the charge, due to their massive gold holdings and gold mines.

The year is 2025. In the depths of a recession even more severe than the one we saw in 2009, the US government reveals they have been accumulating bitcoin since 2018, and have built a sizeable position of 500,000 BTC (equivalent to $250b with BTC trading at $500k). This sparks the re-birth of a new bitcoin bull run as the other central banks announces they too, now hold some BTC. Many central banks, especially the resource-poor countries who never saw the rebirth of gold coming, begin accumulating BTC as well. Many now fear Russia and China's dominance in the gold market. Despite gold being a decentralized store of wealth, the natural geographical distribution has made many other resource-poor countries bitter, and an unspoken alliance began taking shape as central banks secretly accumulate bitcoin. Countries begin to publicly denounce gold, even as gold ownership is quickly being transferred into the blockchain. Gold prices fall after entering a blow-off top in 2027.

Bitcoin begins to climb until it reaches a ""demand equilibrium"" with gold. By 2030, bitcoin is valued at $2m+ and represents a significant percentage of the global money supply and gold has fallen to $4k/oz. By the 2030s+ the world has transitioned to a fiat system that is completely transparent. All countries' reserves in both bitcoin and gold are publicly trackable on the blockchain. While fiat continues to live on, governments in the aftermath of the early 2020s recession now have learnt fiscal prudence and bond yields actually reflect market-priced default risk depending on a country's money supply vis a vis the value of the bitcoin and gold their central bank holds.

The economy never really recovered from the recession in the 2020s. Artificial intelligence had taken over most of the economy's jobs, and the wealth inequality continued to widen as more and more wealth accrued to owners of capital. The crash in the equity markets at the turn of the decade had also wiped out a generation's savings and therefore willingness to spend - the millennial investors who had gleefully piled into FAANGs as everyone turned euphoric into the last days of the stock market bubble. Deflation began to set in as the boomers started dying in record numbers, and consumer spending ground to a halt as nobody except the elites and the crypto-rich had any money to spend. By the late 2020s governments realized that a form of universal basic income was necessary or the economy would never recover, but a redistribution of wealth was not going to be possible. Countries came together and decided that a new UBI cryptocurrency would be created, in direct proportion to the amount of bitcoin and gold each country owned. With every single individual having their own unique identity stored on the blockchain, this was easy and transparent to implement. This ultimately paved the way for a global common cryptocurrency in 2030. Gold began to lose its shine.

By the mid 2030s, we entered a golden era for the human race as the wealth inequality came back down to levels unseen in the past 500 years. Productivity reached a new high, assisted by mature technologies that first appeared in the 2010s. Significant life extension, space exploration, nanotechnology, then the uploading of the human consciousness ...

In 2040, we encountered the Singularity.

So, the common sense is for Bitcoin to replace the current monetary system. However, I believe this would not be easy as the current monetary system has deep-rooted powerful and influential institutions associated with it. 

What needs to really happen for Bitcoin to take over? Is it just the mass realization? Do the Federal Banks need to just fail and give up? Will a massive global recession due to inflation result in Bitcoin adoption?

XRP,Bitcoin,once the lightning network gains critical mass it will become the strongest network effect we have ever seen.,"I used to wonder when everyone will start accepting bitcoin, but now I realise they probably wont.  Whats more likely is that the world starts seeing lightning as the one global payments protocol for sending and recieving payments. Lightning infrastructure companies all over the world will start helping existing financial apps and point of sale service providers to integrate with lightning so that any app whether that be cashapp paypal wise or your local payments app and banking apps will be able to send to lightning and recieve from lightning while every point of sale and ecommerce solution will be able to recieve to lightning invoices.

Once this happens every app in every country will be able to pay any other app in any other country including point of sale devices and ecommerce checkouts and for the first time in human history the worlds financial system will finally be interoperable and easy to use on a global scale.

Most people wont know what bitcoin or lightning is, all they will know is their app can now send to any other app and pay to any merchant on earth online or in person. 

This seems like the logical progression. Maybe in 10 or 20 years everyone will hold their balances in sats too because of fiat currency depreciation but in the near term it is the lightning network that will proliferate around the world and become one of the worlds strongest network effects we have ever seen. Any app or bank or merchant that isnt plugged into lightning will be left behind.

The cherry on top is that as lightning gains its unstoppable network effects and proliferates around the world anyone with a simple lightning wallet holding some sats will be able to fully integrate into that system being able to send and recieve to any person and any merchant on earth. Thats the ultimate goal. Lightning is the trojan horse that will put bitcoin at the very center of the worlds new financial system.

So I have stopped asking the question when will merchants accept bitcoin and have started asking the question how long until the existing payments infrastructure plugs into lightning. Network effects are strong and network effects for payments are far stronger than any social network, afterall payments are far more important to people than facebook. So it is highly likely that by 2030 the entire worlds financial apps and point of sale solutions will all be integrated with the lightning network.

Critical mass for the lightning network may start once a handful of banks or point of sale service providers have integrated in 10 or 20 of the largest nations. At that point the network effect of payments will see lightning go mainstream extremely quickly. We have already seen xapo private bank integrate lightning and blackhawk POS service provider in the US integrate lightning. By 2025 we may have reached critical mass escape velocity and between 2025 and 2030 lightning will spread around the world until it is used by absolutely every financial app and point of sale terminal on earth.",88,2023-03-07 09:23:43,36

Being that Bitcoin is decentralized, there is no standard, nor governing body, to dictate what notation should be used for it. Nonetheless, ""BTC"" has been the generally accepted abbreviation for Bitcoin stemming from the early days of Bitcoin.

""XBT"" is a new abbreviation for Bitcoin that is starting to come into use and reflects its growing legitimacy as an international currency.

The abbreviation ""XBT"" comes from the International Standards Organization (ISO) that maintains a list of internationally recognized currencies. The standard dictates that if a currency is not associated with a particular country, it should begin with an “X”, hence ""XBT"". Another example of this is the abbreviation for gold, ""XAU"".

XRP,Bitcoin,I wonder what these are for…,,48,2022-08-19 23:57:55,49
XRP,Bitcoin,"The ultimate goal for Bitcoin is to establish ""Bretton Woods 2.0"", where the countries use Layer 1 and the citizens use Lightning Network - for their settlements.","In original version of [Bretton Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system) - the fiat money was circulating and it was theoretically exchangable to gold at constant $35/ounce rate, this way imitating the circulation of gold. But this system was based on Trust - and that's the clear reason why it finally collapsed.

In ""Bretton Woods 2.0"" there is no Trust involved, just because Bitcoin itself is circulating there - so there is no risk that some country cheats the rest and the system will collapse like in a prototype.

Countries make settlements with each other on the first layer (usually big transfers). Citizens of these countries suddenly gain access to banking and make settlements with each other on the second layer i.e. Lightning Network (cheap, fast and with almost unlimited throughput)

XRP,Bitcoin,"I'm sorry folks, but Bitcoin has died. Can you cheer me up?","It's just too volatile, it went from $68k down to now just $19k.  Bukele in El Salvador is starting to look ridiculous now.  Central African Republic talks a good game, but how can their population use Bitcoin when most don't even have internet access.  People have lost faith.  It's too slow anyhow, with only 7 transactions per second.  

I'm feeling melancholy right now.  I feel like we have lost.  Can anyone say anything that will cause this buttercup to buck up?",0,2022-07-06 13:11:32,60

I already have a ""cold"" wallet (edit: Arculus), but I'm looking for something more secure for long term storage. It needs to be usable by communicating the cold wallet with a phone alone (edit: vs having to communicate with a computer), no personal node required, no DIY like seedsigner. Bitcoin only is fine with me. 

I've seen Coldcard, BitBox02, Ellipal, Safepal, Keystone, Jade, but which one do you swear by and use for your HODLing?",9,2022-12-29 23:52:28,44
XRP,Bitcoin,Right now money is moving back from all alts to BTC...,,150,2017-08-13 01:31:45,98
XRP,Bitcoin,Be patient with the halving.,"Just another reminder to people don't spend more money on bitcoin then you can afford to lose. With the halvening coming up in may a lot of people seem to be pumped up expecting an almost immediate price jump as a result of the halvening. Just a reminder that the last time the reward halved in June 2016 it took until about December of 2017 (about 18 months)  to hit its all time high, so if it doesn't happen in the course of 10-15 minutes (block mining time) don't panic sell just yet. This is why we say do not risk any more then you can afford to lose.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,RippleGirl | Massive moonshot | XRP Rewards | Very low MC and massive marketing coming," As a Magical Girl, Ripple has long, dark brown hair that is put in a ponytail by a silver shuriken-like clip and brown-red eyes.During the events of the Unmarked, Ripple lost her left eye and arm. As a result, she now has a large scar over on the left side of her face and keeps her left eye closed at all times. Her outfit still remains the same though, due to the rules of becoming a Magical Girl.Deep down, Ripple also has a somewhat childish side, as shown when she made her Magical Girl character a ninja because she thought it looked ""cool"". However, she doesn't want anyone to know about this side of her and skillfully hides it. Her Specialty:

4-Dimensional XRP Bag: A magical bag. Not limited to objects, as living things can be packed into it, too. It's more of a bag rather than a pocket. Ripple took it after killing Calamity Mary.

RippleGirl is a newly launched token on the BSC. The aim of the token is pure fun and rewards. RippleGirl has a super low buy and sell tax of 8% of which 4% goes to XRP rewards and 4% goes to marketing. 40% of the supply has already been burned. All funds raised so far have been sent out to influencers, call groups and the best investors in the BSC. There are fun contests where the community wins BNB as well. It's an excellent hang with some excellet gains and a solid, based team.

The team has launched many legitimate tokens on the BSC with great Dapps, this is strictly a fun rewards play by the team. With super SAFU coding to make the investor secure in their investment. The team always delivers on their promises, feel free to stop by the telegram group to see the proof of how the marketing funds are used and everyone's huge bag of XRP rewards.

Why have a play that's just fun with no use case? Because we're all here to have a good time. Each one of these tokens is like its own little country with it's own curreny and we want you to belong to our country. Come be a part of the RippleGirl community. We're brining the BSC back to what it once was community based rewards tokens, with straight forward tokenomics and a transparent team. Come make a suggestion and help the community to reach new heights never seen before in the BSC. The community is already super solid and enjoying the token.

Many low MC plays try to simply take their investors with crazy tokenomics that cost high transaction fees and high tax for buys and sells. It's hard to feel safe when you're paying a super high percentage in and out. This is simple and straight forward, without those crazy high transaction fees and solid XRP rewards.

Rewards tokens inherently cause red candles to sell tokens fo rth rewards. The developers have combatted this with innovative rewards functions that optimize both gas and selling pressure on the chart. Rewards are on a volume and holdeings based payout schedule. As usual a holder can interact with the contract in anyway to receive rewards as well. (buy/trade/sell)

What Marketing? Come join our VC where we discuss every marketing technique we us ein detail with many influencers right in the voice chat. Transparency is of the upmost importance to us. Prelaunch we had our graphics designer pop out some great jpegs and 25 animated stickers. THe plan is to make sure everyone sees LadyCat everywhere.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Rebellion Protocol just launched💥 First systemic exponential growth token | CZ in TG chat at launch🔥 2 Days old | Contract audited & Liquidity locked | AMAs lined-up🎙 Massive marketing🚀,"HIGHLIGHTS

**💻 Tech - Solid tech with self-enhancing mechanisms leading to exponential growth.**

**📊 Vision – Elevate an entire community to financial freedom**

**✊ Community – Great and fun community to ride with**

**🏋️‍♂️ Team – Multicultural, European, engineers, execs from leading companies**

&#x200B;

The Rebellion Protocol is the first 100% community driven systemic exponential growth cryptocurrency project.

&#x200B;

The project stems from a simple question: Can we create together a project that is so strong that it elevates an entire community to financial freedom and subsequently makes the established financial system irrelevant?

&#x200B;

The answer was to build a cryptocurrency with the kind of systemic growth that generates ripple effect throughout its entire ecosystem, that is self-enhancing and exponential, and therein displays overwhelming momentum and moves with unstoppable force. 

&#x200B;

The project's primary token, Rebellion protocol ($REBL), a BEP-20 token, incorporates built-in virtuous-circle mechanisms, such as Reflection (automatic reward to token holders), Automatic LP Scalability (automatic liquidity increase) and allocations to what is called the ""Rocket Pool” (an investment fund governed by the community). Each of these three mechanisms are financed by a 3% fee taken on each $REBL transactions, resulting in a total transaction fee of 9%.

&#x200B;

The project envisions an ecosystem where decentralization is key. As such, a secondary token, called Forger DAO ($FORG), a BEP-20 token, will be developed to function as a governance token for its holders to drive the project. $FORG exhibits no transaction fees. Both tokens function in tandem, as $FORG tokens are distributed to people staking $REBL, while $FORG tokens guarantee its holders the power to govern the $REBL project.

&#x200B;

As a $REBL token holder, you constantly receive additional $REBL (due to the reflection mechanism), if you stake these $REBL then you are constantly rewarded with $FORG on top of your $REBL (due to the staking reward). This means, the more you wait, the more value accumulates in your wallet and the more powerful you become over the project.

&#x200B;

The project's mascot, named the RainMaker, is from the Dogo Argentino breed, a pack-hunting dog that exhibits our community’s values: bravery, loyalty and union.

&#x200B;

We are more than a community, we are a rebellion! Join us on our way to Saturn.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,"StellaRise 🐼 is set for a presale on Wednesday 4th, with a full launch on PancakeSwap 24 hours after! Use StellaRise to ride the XLM rocket ship!","Hi 

It's a pleasure to share our project with the community here, I hope to see the same enthusiasm we have in the team to reach space cruise speed.

Is there anyone who wants to miss out on this space trip? 🚀

STELLARISE 🌌

StellaRise 🐼 is set for a presale on Wednesday 4th, with a full launch on PancakeSwap 24 hours after! Use StellaRise to ride the XLM rocket ship!

It's simple: StellaRise awards holders with XLM for free automatically every six hours. The more StellaRise you hold, the more XLM you get.

You can also claim XLM manually after buying - see details in the TG.

🌟 WHAT IS XLM? 🌟

Lumen (XLM) is the native cryptocurrency for Stellar, an open source blockchain payment system. The purpose of Stellar is to connect financial institutions via the blockchain and provide cheap transactions in developing markets. Jed McCaleb, the co-founder of Ripple (XRP), created Stellar in July of 2014.

XLM has a MC of $ 28.15B and average 24-hour volume of $ 575.06M.

XLM has been flying, soaring up 16% recently: https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/xlm-price-sprints-higher-as-rumors-of-stellar-acquiring-moneygram-surface-202107221900

# About Rebellion Protocol

The Rebellion Protocol is a crypto focused venture capital (VC) fund that is entirely on the blockchain and 100% driven by the community, through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

The project stems from a simple question: Can we create, by pooling the knowledge of a massive amount of people, an investment vehicle that generates an alpha above average classical crypto VC funds? 

The answer was to build a venture capital fund, fully on the blockchain, where the community makes decisions and with mechanics that generates ripple effect throughout its entire ecosystem, that is virtuous and exponential, and therein provides some of the highest financial returns ever created by a VC fund. 

Classical investment funds raise money among High Net Worth Individuals and big financial institutions, which makes such investment difficult to access for 99% of the global population. The process is very cumbersome and paper heavy.

Rebellion Protocol on the contrary is accessible to anyone and structured in a simple manner. Anyone can buy the Rebellion token ($REBL) and therefore become a VC investor. On top of that, Rebellion Protocol does not raise money, it takes fees on its token transactions to finance its VC fund. So no need to spend enormous time on roadshows (which don't create value) or answer to big institutional investors, that could force us into acting in a way we don't want to act. In fact, Rebellion Protocol answers to no one except its community. Our community governs the project through the Rebellion Protocol Decentralized Autonomous Organization (REBL DAO).

The project's VC fund invests in promising blockchain projects, ideally at a pre-sale stage, and aims to achieve a minimum of 10x or 1000% returns over the investment period. It therefore deploys funds with a mid to long-term investment horizon. In terms of investment focus, it invests in projects with a compelling use case, strong teams/backers/advisors, healthy token economics and is agnostic to blockchain technologies or trends.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,BRETT: The Meme Coin Making Waves Amidst Coinbase's Basechain Expansion,"As the crypto market experiences a dynamic resurgence, all eyes are once again on digital assets. In early March, Bitcoin's break past its all-time high sparked a renewed fervor in the industry. The wave of ETF approvals has added fuel to the fire, pushing investors to secure their positions in this rapidly evolving landscape.

The realized profits and losses (PNLs) from this surge have been staggering, catching the attention of seasoned managers at Blackrock. Major exchanges are now competing for a strategic edge in this booming market.

Coinbase, a leading regulatory exchange in the crypto space, created ripples in 2023 with the launch of Basechain. This week, they made headlines again with the announcement of a new smart wallet and ambitious plans to onboard over one billion users onto their chain.

Retail investors have surged back into the market, gravitating towards popular meme coins such as DOGE, SHIBA, WIF, PEPE, and FLOKI. Listed on Binance, these coins have seen significant performance boosts amid the current rally.

Amidst speculation about which coin will dominate Coinbase's Basechain, one contender has garnered considerable attention throughout March: BRETT. Created by Matt Furie, the mind behind PEPE, BRETT resonates with the 'crypto degen culture,' sparking excitement among enthusiasts.

For those doubting the influence of meme culture in the crypto world, it's worth noting how BRETT's rise coincides with Coinbase's Basechain announcement. This alignment has amplified the buzz around BRETT's potential ascent, suggesting a powerful synergy between meme culture and institutional endorsement.

Both traders and retail investors are speculating that BRETT could replicate the success of PEPE and WIF, especially against the backdrop of Coinbase's latest announcement. The sustained market volume indicates that legacy markets and institutional investors are unfazed by the meme coin's rise.

BRETT's potential as a leading meme coin on Basechain is evident, having reached the 650M mark in early March alone. With its position as a frontrunner on a new chain and the backing of Coinbase's announcement, BRETT is poised to join the ranks of crypto legends.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,"SPECULATION/DOT CONNECTION Ripple moving to financial hub of the world(UK)? Same time brexit transition period ending on 12/31/2020, marking the expiration of Britain’s participation in the EU Customs Union and Euro Single Market.","Xrp is very polarizing, it’s community is full of moon boys and known for conspiracies. However I think a lot of it is substantiated. 

When you do your own research it’s hard to ignore that Ripple and Xrp are positioned to potentially play some integral role in this new global financial system materializing before our eyes, on the back of blockchain and distributed ledger technology. It’s hard to ignore the relationships with central banks, foreign governments, and international finance organizations. We can talk about that if you disagree. We can talk about it being a dumb scheme vs Ripple just using that capital to build out the XRP ecosystem... 

Lets use the speculation in the title, (ironically a result of Ripple being basically the only crypto/blockchain infrastructure company pushing for regulatory framework that will result in most cryptos going to 0) as a segue to those topics. 

What do you guys think about Ripple moving to the U.K.? See any implications since the U.K. is about to shift monetarily and undergo an economic/financial restructuring??",1,2020-10-11 21:57:04,13

📫 Telegram: [https://t.me/DrippleX](https://t.me/DrippleX)

DrippleX is an NFT brand which will allow it to leverage the audience it gains to create demand for it’s limited editions drops, and it will also be utilised as a launchpad platform for up and coming artists who will need to create something stand-out which represents the brand.In order to be picked out from a cohort of people who would like to be boost started in the NFT world.

Launching 4-Sept-2021 🚀

In essence it will be a hub where new NFT artists can try to find their break. In addition to that half the revenue generated from the limited edition NFT drops created by our brand will be used to buy and burn DrippleX.

In a world where new ‘meme coins’ are released everyday with rushed launches, no long-term objective and no actual plan set before the launch. We want to change that and become the pioneer in this space.

The near future⏳:

Once DrippleX takes off we will be looking to build our own nft market-place, this will allow us to further expand our brand and drive traffic to us. increasing demand whilst enabling us to stay at the fore-front of the nft landscape.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,XRP Apes just got listed on CoinGecko,"XRP Apes is now listed on CoinGecko

Before you read any further, some quick take always.

7% rewards in XRP just for holding. Not like the 5% rewards token where you need to hold for 3 days and if you sell, you’re disqualified. Nope, every hour (during times of higher volume), but if it isn’t every hour, the rewards still accumulate. VC is open almost 24/7. Most lit chat in all of BSC. CMC listing is imminent. Audited by tech rate. Creating an alliance. Join the TG to find out more.

XRP Apes 7% automatic XRP rewards. Launched Friday morning (US time)

🦧Welcome to XRP APES 🦍🦧

7% automatic XRP rewards every 60 minutes (with higher volume). During times of lesser volume, rewards will compound and be sent once threshold is met.

XRP APES is the all-encompassing crypto ecosystem that brings swap, XRP rewards, AND anti-whale mechanisms together to deliver you comfortably to the moon! 🚀 🌝

XRP Apes is changing the game with 7% automatic XRP rewards.

Why is our coin so big? 3 letters, 1 coin. ❗️❗️X R P❗️❗️ We all know where XRP will be in a few years. XRP is easily a top 3 coin if it weren’t for the US judicial system. Once Ripple wins, there is no where to go but up. ⬆️

We have run ads and will run more ads on poocoins, have been trending on coinsniper, will be listed on CMC, and Trust Wallet. We have been tweeted by Crypto Messiah, Fabri Crypto, have been on Satoshi Bets, and many many others. We have had several yourubers reach out to us and crypto cowboy did a review live on his show.

Voice chats almost 24/7. Come and talk about anything. We don’t care.

Have you heard of Everrise and Tiki, well XRP APES is combining both elements and more.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Looney Moons BSC Token | Native Token Launched | $300 BNB / BUSD Competition is Live!,"You've all already heard about Looney Moons...

The ripple effect it made in the BSC space has already taken everybody by surprise. That's probably due to the massive hype around our game which was launched before the native token's launch with a BNB pairing.

But now we're starting a new stream of competitions and giveaways for the next few weeks. So this is the first of many!

Check out the competition here: [https://sweepwidget.com/view/47833-19tsb2my](https://sweepwidget.com/view/47833-19tsb2my)

You only need to complete a few items to be eligible, so it takes less than 5 mins to fill out. You have a chance of winning! What is there to lose?

─────────────────

Here are some of the project details! Enjoy!

Welcome to... Looney Moons!

Token Rewards, Staking, Lotto, and Beanstalk rewards! 💰

What is Looney Moons?

It's a brand new and exciting multi- purpose token that is backed by several utilities. Designed to reward our investors in BNB and Tokens for getting involved and playing our games and Hodling our Token $LMS.

─────────────────

The Play-2-Earn minigame is called Looney Moons Invaders (LMI) - Where you will be able to navigate your Space Ship through the deep void of Outer-Space, collecting gold tokens, and dodging incoming Asteroids that are crashing towards you! — How long does the game last? — Well that depends on how quickly you run out of fuel! So make sure you grab the Cannisters to top up your tank! ⛽️🚀☄️

The Rewards & Tokenomics System is intricately designed to give our investors Beans (BNB) for Holding on to the beanstalk (Staking) - The longer you hold and the more you stake, the more you will be rewarded over time! As more members join and stake, the tax and rewards grow higher – akin to a beanstalk. 📊📈☁️

THE LOTTERY also known as ""The Giants Treasure"" is built from the ground by our own FANTASTIC Dev and Project Manager; where ""Jack"" will come in at a reasonably high level (\~20%) and randomly cut down the Green Wall (The Beanstalk) to 7%, where it will start to grow back up again! 🎋🪓💰

─────────────────

👉 Holders of $LMS will have exclusive access to our rare NFT collection!

👉 Each Looney Moons character will have their own ""one-of-a-kind"" NFT (This means if you hold one, you hold the only one in existence!)

👉 We are developing a Cartoon Series that will FEATURE THE CHARACTERS FROM THE NFTs and will be released in Q1 of 2022. This series will be available exclusively on our YouTube channel!

👉 We will soon enough be venturing into developing a metaverse game that puts you inside the Looney Moons Universe.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,"Cryptocurrency Arbitration: Cardano and XRP on Exchanges possible guys! Really useful information for trading
","Cryptocurrency arbitrage is one of the most attractive strategies for traders looking for ways to make money on the difference in asset prices on various trading exchanges. In this article, we will look at the possibilities of arbitrage using two popular cryptocurrencies — Cardano (ADA) and XRP (Ripple), as well as key points that should be taken into account when conducting such transactions.  
  
What is arbitration?  
Arbitrage in cryptocurrency trading is the purchase of an asset on one exchange, where its price is lower, and subsequent sale on another exchange, where the price is higher. The price difference arises from differences in supply and demand across platforms. This creates short-term profit opportunities if traders are willing to react quickly to market changes. The topic of arbitrage is quite extensive and therefore you can watch my individual arbitrage trading method on my verified YouTube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXHnhvObw8E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXHnhvObw8E)  
  
Why choose Cardano and XRP?  
Cardano (ADA) and XRP are two large cryptocurrencies with a high level of liquidity and widespread use on a variety of exchanges, which makes them ideal for arbitrage strategies.  
  
Cardano (ADA) is a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications that has attracted attention with its thoughtful architecture and strong development team. ADA is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies with a large number of trading pairs on different exchanges, which creates frequent arbitrage opportunities.  
  
XRP (Ripple) is a digital currency designed for instant global payments with minimal fees. Thanks to ultra-fast transactions, XRP is an ideal candidate for arbitrage, as it allows you to quickly move funds between exchanges, minimizing time delays.  
  
The main types of arbitration  
Several types of strategies can be used in arbitrage using Cardano (ADA) and XRP coins:  
  
Inter-exchange arbitrage: a classic strategy in which you buy ADA or XRP on one exchange, where the price is lower, and sell on another, where the price is higher. This requires a quick transfer of assets between platforms and monitoring of several exchanges at the same time.  
  
Arbitrage within the same exchange: In some cases, there may be price differences between different trading pairs on the same exchange. For example, ADA may be undervalued relative to BTC, but overvalued relative to ETH on the same exchange. This opens up opportunities for arbitrage without the need to transfer assets to other platforms.  
  
Triangulation arbitration: This is a more complex strategy that uses multiple trading pairs. For example, you can start with XRP, exchange it for ADA, and then for another cryptocurrency (for example, BTC) if this chain makes a profit.  
  
Advantages and features of arbitration with ADA and XRP  
Using Cardano and XRP for arbitrage has a number of advantages:  
  
Fast transactions with XRP: One of the key problems of arbitrage is the time to transfer funds between exchanges. XRP, thanks to its high speed and low fees, allows you to minimize waiting time and respond quickly to market opportunities.  
  
ADA Liquidity: Cardano has wide coverage on most major exchanges, which creates many trading pairs with this coin. Due to this, traders have a better chance of finding arbitrage opportunities.  
  
Low fees: Both XRP and ADA have low transaction fees, which makes them advantageous for arbitrage transactions where even small price fluctuations can be profitable.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,The Future of Gaming is in the Metaverse. The Kusunoki Token!,"When Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would be changing its name to Meta, it caused ripples throughout the industry. Such a significant shift from one of the world’s most valuable companies created a groundswell of interest in this concept of a metaverse. Zuckerberg is betting that the next frontier of technology is going to be in fully immersive virtual worlds that will become the home for work and play alike.
 
It’s difficult to bet against this when you consider the rapid advancements that we’ve seen in virtual reality, augmented reality, and the associated hardware that make all of this possible. It seems inevitable that as things improve, we will spend more and more time in metaverses of various kinds.
 
 
**How Will This Affect Gaming?**
 
Video games are a massive industry and they often lead the way in terms of adopting new technology. If you look at how the internet and streaming in particular changed the way that the industry operates, you get a sense of how quickly gaming adapts and adjusts to new paradigms. This will be no different.
 
Game developers have an opportunity to create the sorts of virtual worlds that can transform the gaming experience forever. The metaverse offers a level of escapism that is hard to fathom until you experience it for yourself. As we have been building Kusunoki Samurai, our spirits have been buoyed by the intense realism and simultaneous interactivity that is possible when you build in the metaverse. This is very clearly the future of the industry where you can interact with a 3D world in real-time, exploring without constraint, and living the lives of your characters.
 
**It’s a game-changer.**
 
 
How We Think About the Potential of the Metaverse
 
Our game Kusunoki Samurai will be built to be metaverse-first. We’ve worked hard to lean into this future, and we are confident that the technology is there for us to create an authentic 14th-century environment for our players to engage with. Through a combination of augmented reality and virtual reality, we hope that our game will act as a beacon for what is possible in this new metaverse-centric future.
 
Early adopters who see the potential here and build accordingly have a chance to radically transform the gaming industry, leading the way as we march towards what seems to be inevitable. There will of course be growing pains along the way but there are enough tailwinds here to accelerate wider development and adoption as time goes on.
 
Our game will be at the forefront in this exciting new canon that will challenge the status quo. We will start to see a convergence of VR-realism, crypto-based micro-economies, and internet-enabled global communities. Bringing these together promises to craft something that we have never seen before. This is the gaming of the future and we’re incredibly excited to play our part in it.
 
If you’d like to follow along on the Kusunoki Samurai journey, we’d love to have you along for the ride! Watch this space, the gaming industry is in the midst of a serious inflection point.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,How Does $Shogun’s Price to Go Up When There’s More Selling Pressure?,"The other day, I noticed something strange while looking at **ShogunCrypto**. There were more people selling the token than buying it, yet the price still went **up**. At first, I couldn’t wrap my head around it. Isn’t the price supposed to drop when there’s more selling?



Turns out, the answer lies in something called **liquidity depth**, and once I understood it, I got even more excited about what Shogun is doing.



**What is Liquidity Depth?** Here’s how I think of it: Liquidity is like a big pool of money that lets people trade tokens without causing huge price swings. The deeper the pool, the harder it is for any single trade to create big ripples. If someone sells a lot of tokens, the price might dip slightly, but it won’t crash. If someone buys a lot, the price will rise gradually instead of spiking.



Shogun has a deep liquidity pool, which means the price stays steady even when there’s more selling than buying. That’s why I saw the price go up despite higher selling volume—it’s all about how the pool balances itself after each trade.



**Why This Matters ?**



This is a game-changer. Shogun’s deep liquidity gives me confidence that my investment won’t be wiped out by sudden price drops. At the same time, it allows for **steady growth** when there’s more buying interest. It’s like finding a project that knows how to stay calm in a storm.



This stability shows that Shogun isn’t just another risky token. It’s designed to handle pressure and grow sustainably, which is something I really value. I’m not here for quick flips—I want to be part of something that’s built to last, and Shogun feels like that kind of project.



**The Takeaway**



If you’ve ever been confused about how a token’s price can rise even when more people are selling, it all comes down to liquidity depth. And Shogun has it figured out. It’s not just about hype or short-term gains—it’s about creating a strong, stable foundation for long-term success.



That’s why I’m excited to share this. Shogun keeps surprising me, and I’m proud to be part of a project that’s doing things the right way.

COIN 98 is a Multi-Chain Wallet & DeFi Gateway that is certainly making waves at the moment.

&#x200B;

Our first objective as holders of COIN 98 from day 1 is to generate profits, taking advantage of the well-deserved hype of the main currency by redistributing a part of it to the holders so as to increase the volume of COIN 98 as well.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

🏅 8% Transaction Fee to Buyback $Coin98

💰 7% Development Fee

💰 1% Liquidity Pool

💰 4% Extra Fee on Sell 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We suffered the birth of a myriad of Pancakes, Ripple, Cardano Rewards Token , most of which turned out to be scams. So we decided to create a legitimate Reward Coin, that would reward holders with the coin we think will be the game changer of 2022. Coin 98 (multi-chain liquidity aggregator that supports assets across a variety of blockchains, including but not limited to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Tron).

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Bullish,"If Bitcoin rises to $70,000-$75,000, it could create a ripple effect across the crypto market, boosting assets like Solana and meme coins like $HEGE. A Bitcoin rally often leads to increased investor confidence and a bullish market sentiment, drawing new capital into the broader crypto ecosystem. This capital flow can spill over into altcoins as investors diversify beyond Bitcoin. 

Historically, many altcoins correlate with Bitcoin’s price movements, meaning Solana could experience a secondary rally as the market becomes more active. Solana, a well-regarded Layer 1 platform, may see further gains as more users and investors are drawn to its ecosystem. Additionally, smaller tokens like $HEGE could benefit from this increased liquidity, as investors look for higher-risk, high-reward opportunities within the bullish environment.

Moreover, high Bitcoin prices often lead to greater exploration of Layer 1 platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, areas where Solana and projects like $HEGE could gain traction. If $HEGE reaches $0.02, it will likely be due to increased trading volume and visibility as part of this larger, market-wide movement.",3,2024-10-29 16:32:05,8

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,DEXM: Cashing In On The Meme Mania Without Risky Memes,"Good afternoon lads.

Bear with me here. I promise there is a coin-related post below. You should read everything though.

I am back. Yet again I have crawled my way to this sub, protected by the eternal power of my sweet VIDYA gains as I traversed through Vitallik’s gas fee ridden hellscape.  

Although I have returned, I am a changed man. The all-powerful cryptocurrency entity, “hotdogfishguy”, he whose name is echoed by the blockchain bards in the hallowed halls of faraway lands, that golden light of truth and transparency in this scamcoin ridden arena of code, is dead. He is no more. Gone. Consumed by the abyss, taken by the Ethereum void. He will be forever remembered in the hearts of those on this sub, in the souls of all the lads and ladettes he touched with his unprecedented charm, his blend of charismatic humor and phenomenal calls, including but not limited to Asko (65x), Strudel (7x), Chow (15x), and most recently and most famously, Vidya, a beautiful 4x.

In his last post before his untimely demise, hotdogfishguy achieved his dream, reached the pinnacle of his earthly existence. Not only did he achieve the Top Post of All Time on this subreddit (until recently overtaken by another, less amazing post, one which is clearly a farce (I mean seriously look at the comment:upvote ratio)), but he was yet again awarded REDDIT SILVER, an honor that struck him to his core. Shortly before his death, he told me that he would pass down this award to his posterity through a complex and pre-written spiritual ritual for generations to come. Thank You, Kind Stranger. The numerous wholesome comments made his day.

May He Rest In Peace.

HARK, TAKE HEED! What is this? A stranger rides over the horizon, his silhouette aglow with the golden glaze of a thousand blockchain suns. His jaw square, his eyes deep and the rippling blue of a stocked liquidity pool. It is him. It is the redeemer. It is hotdogfishguy (cooler version with more Karma and awards this time), Warden of the Dex, Born of Blockchain and Cold Steel, Forged in the Fires of Rugs, Famed Traverser of the Great Ethereum Sea.

He cometh to present a coin. Take heed.

The coin is DEXM, and their product/UI is launching on the 21st. Like my last post on my old account and in contrast to 99% of other posts in this sub, I will not be telling you “muh 100x in 2021 muh”. I will simply be transparently presenting my research and opinion on this project. Make your own decision, and let me know what you think.

First, I’ll go over tokenomics, followed by a summary of the coin’s use and its technicalities. I will finish this post with a description of the quickly approaching launch that is/will be the catalyst for this project.

Site: [https://www.dexmex.info](https://www.dexmex.info/)

New whitepaper and URL confirmed to go alongside the March 21 product launch.

Dextools: [https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0xc92b1c381450c5972ee3f4a801e651257aed449a](https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0xc92b1c381450c5972ee3f4a801e651257aed449a)

For transparency’s sake, I’m in at $0.16 and $0.18. 

Quick Tokenomics Rundown: 

Market Cap: 7M

Volume: 1.2M and building 

Uni Liquidity: 2M

Holder number is low, which is nice, and the liquidity is locked through Unicrypt.

The audit can be found here: [https://www.dexmex.info/doc/DexMex\_Audit.pdf](https://www.dexmex.info/doc/DexMex_Audit.pdf)

A new audit is coming on the 21st as well.

Into the Coin:

DexMex is a Uniswap-based decentralized exchange that allows any ERC-20 token to be shorted or longed (is that a word?) with peer-to-peer leverage. Any token you want, be it a rugpull-imminent meme coin or a legit blue chip can have a leveraged short or long applied to it. Fees are extremely low at only .8% on entry into a position, an attractive feature that puts DEXM far ahead of the (almost nonexistent) competitors. (I like parenthesis.) That .8% fee breaks down to .4% to DEXM stakers, .2% to buybacks/burn, and .2% to the treasury.

The payouts for the aforementioned leveraged positions are not the result of a borrowing or margin system; rather, the gains are derived from the losing position(s) of the shorts/longs. As a result of the lack of such a margin system, there is no risk of liquidations or margin-calls, as you are only risking as much as the price of the underlying asset fluctuates.

The progressive leverage feature is extremely interesting--for each short:long ratio, a multiplier is derived which is calculated from the volume on each side of the position. Theoretically, there is no limit on this multiplier.

Ok. So we have a peer-to-peer decentralized leverage trading system in which there are no liquidations and theoretically infinite multipliers exist. The system is 100% self sustainable, as the aforementioned multipliers and payouts are based on position volume and gains/losses.

That was a bunch of technical stuff. Now for the real-world application aspects of the project’s attractiveness.

People like taking risks. People like being able to trade on margin, because the higher risks come with higher reward. Margin trading is extremely popular. With DEXM, you can take leveraged positions on literally anything you want on the Ethereum chain, and you will never be liquidated for it. There are attractive volume-related multipliers as long as the volume and opposite-side interest exists

We have all seen how degenerate gambling and memecoins have taken over crypto. You’ve felt the FOMO, the hole in your chest as random DogCoin#2434653 does a 500x and your cat coin gets rugged. 

DEXM is a shining stone in the black fog of the current degenerate meme gambling mania. If you got burned on HOGE and hate it with a passion, you can take out a giant short on it without liquidation fear. If you feel the gut wrenching FOMO as aforementioned random DogCoin#2434653 does a 500x, you can take out a leveraged long on the next one.

Now is the perfect environment for a product like DEXM. **It gets exposure to the current gambling meme craze without actually being a degenerate meme coin.** You get the best of both worlds. You can hold DEXM, a legit coin with an actual innovative use case and team, and profit from the inevitable flood of degeneracy as crypto traders across the globe realize that not only can they throw an irresponsible amount of money at today’s meme craze, but that they can even use leverage to long or short it. You could also make informed, relatively low-leverage shorts/longs on non-memecoins, a far more reasonable and profitable strategy. Who cares about reason though.

The MCAP is still very low, it's just starting to pump and pick up momentum, and the launch on the 21st is generating hype. Again, the launch of the product I’ve just described is literally this weekend.

You aren’t joining the gold rush, you are investing in the pickaxe company. 

You could also short HOGE with potentially infinite leverage, as I assume many would very much like to do. Nice.

Take heed.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,$DROP and why you should become a part of the $DROP ARMY.,"https://www.reddit.com/user/MarkXRPDrop/comments/1gjmcjj/i_bought_xrpl_drop_memecoin_retire_from_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

From Swatoshi Garlichouse on X

-Bear's MC is higher because of the distribution of coins. 1 individual owns over 30% supply and has spread out his holdings to different wallets.

-a bird has nothing to do with xrpl

-dog trend is over played people want something unique with a real narrative that represents the #XRPArmy: $DROP has the community, team, narrative, and uniqueness that no other coin has on the XRPL.

-Blue (Color of water and Ripple)

-Welcoming smiling art

-1 million supply to represent how many drops in 1
SXRP

-A great team and community behind the project - @DropCoinXRPL

-Launched organically with no insiders and a fair distribution at launch, with no airdrops to communities at launch.

When you have other projects taking inspiration from
§DROP like $AND, $FLAME, SICE, SWIND, $CLOUDS making element tokens, it seems like this is the narrative for XRP memes.

I still think BERT has a solid community, and great art, I just don't see it being the face of $XRP Memes. I also like scrap as it's the first ever FL coin, but there is no team compared to both BERT and DROP and the dog trend is kinda over done imo.",7,2024-11-05 22:53:21,5
XRP,CryptoMoonShots,$POWSCHE crazy mfs,"Okay, guys hear me out.

ATH 28M  
1.3M mc right now  
Almost 4k holders  
3k on TG

This is a sleeping giant and let me tell you why I think so:

Those crazy fellas are giving a PORSCHE at 10M ( for real )  
Burning a Tesla at 50M  
And at 100M they gonna burn a Lambo, take Porsche, and spin on it while it burns! ( Fucking badass )

And now I won't rest till I see those milestones reached because it will make fucking history on all sides.

If you look at the chart breakout will be soon, i aped my last 5 SOL in this.

Last part, the top holder and dev are MOVING TOGETHER in real life ( they never met before ) to work for the token, they are consistently making new bots and new ideas and putting them to work.

Please check out TG or other socials and see the community, we have a lot of active people working for the token, awesome vibes!!! This looks just like $kendu or $hege at early steps, but with the step that our ATH is 28M!! we are at 22X from ATH!!!

Invest at least a SOL in this I'm sure you won't regret it!!

Never seen a token with so much potential to attract outside crypto attention, imagine the ripple we gonna send when we burn a Lambo with a Porsche spinning around it? We will be all over the news! In fact, I know you will watch it even if you don't invest in it!

Fucking insane entry point right now, a crazy narrative, led by even crazier people!!

Lets gooooo

Top BSC Marketers in MiniXRP 🗝🗄

&#x200B;

""After moon 🌚 the plan is for full maturation of the MiniXRP project. Receiving auto XRP for holding MiniXRP is only the initial foundation, we will be looking for new and innovative ways to develop further utility as the project progresses. Earning XRP as passive income was strategically chosen due to the stability and popularity of the coin, combined with the exposure XRP is receiving due to the ongoing lawsuit.

XRP is the native cryptocurrency for products developed by Ripple Labs. Its products are used for payment settlement, asset exchange, and remittance systems that work more like SWIFT, a service for international money and security transfers used by a network of banks and financial intermediaries.

Our plan is to impact both the crypto and non crypto sectors like no other token project has done before."" 🏁

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,🔥 Little Baby Doge | Hyper-Deflationary Decentralized Buyback Token | Community Driven | 100x Gem 🚀,"LittleBabyDoge is one of the most innovative crypto projects to date, integrating charity with cryptocurrencies for a more impactful future.
Founded in Stockholm, Sweden in 2021 by an international team of climate change activists who wanted to find a way to take action against the dangerous effects of global warming. Little Baby Doge is created with one purpose - to help make the world a better place. One of our core values is “one for all, and all for one” which means that we are committed to giving back in every way possible. For each transaction made on LBD, 1% will be direct to Greta Thunberg and her Foundation. We believe that being part of the solution starts by taking responsibility for ourselves and our actions and supporting those who do it best – like Greta!

Features:

✅ Buyback: The buyback function is a major part of the LBD’s strategy. It lowers supply and raises demand, which results in an immediate effect on price when activated.

✅ Burn: The tokens bought through buyback are immediately burned.

✅ Locked Liquidty: We want to make sure that all of our investors are protected, which is why we're locking Little Baby Doge LP Tokens.

Why Invest?

Fight climate change with Little Baby Doge

The main objective of Little Baby Doge is to help promote environmental awareness through engaging content and innovative projects that will foster change in our society.

Work With Greta Thunberg

The LBD team is very much inspired by the actions taken by Greta Thunberg to fight climate change. Her impact on world-wide awareness of this global issue has been monumental and it would be an honor for us to work with her in some capacity, as she seems like such a passionate fighter.
Our Climate change activists in Stockholm have planned a surprise for Greta Thunberg. They are going to hand-deliver her an important check as she is delivering either one of the most significant speeches or protests against climate change!

Malicious projects in the Binance Smart Chain space have thrived because of alack of information with new investors in the space. By providing educational discussion regarding trading crypto, we change our investors lives by providing them with the tools that they need to avoid those tokens.

Baby XRP provide a safe BSC token to invest in, with liquidity locked in perpetuity(1), and rewards in the form of Legacy XRP.

Rather than providing reflections in native token, or a buy-back mechanism Baby XRP provides reward in Legacy XRP to reward holding the token and avoid investors being subject to the complexity of and impermanent loss seen when staking LP in farming apps.

Baby XRP also utilizes an automatic liquidity pool to replenish the liquidity of the token on every transaction. The contract will collect tokens from each transactions adding them to the LP, which creates stability for the token, supporting the price floor.

We use several mechanism to encourage holding the tokens, rather than using bots to manipulate price or attempting to pump and dump the token: The requirement to hold tokens for 3 days to get the XRP reward as well will encourage investors to hold.

The tax on each transaction as well is an encouragement to hold. Every transaction is taxed 17 %.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Does my portfolio make sense?,"I'm hoping to get some feedback on my current positions, which are based around a high risk / high reward mindset. What do y'all think of the following holdings and projections? 

**XRP (Ripple)**

Current Price: $0.52 USD

Holdings: 1356 XRP ($705 USD)

Projection: Ripple has been oscillating over the past year with a periodicity of \~4 months between peaks, and the peaks have typically reached $0.70 to $0.80, while the valleys have been steady with a floor around $0.50. I bought during the valley. If the pattern continues, then we will see a peak around July; if it's similar to the last ones, it will have an upside of +50%. Does it make sense to wait for this? 

**PEPE (Pepe on Ethereum)**

Current Price: $0.0000095

Holdings: 43.2 million PEPE ($410 USD)

Projection: PEPE is currently surging! I re-bought some coins today during the little dip (-7%), and I'm hoping that we'll cross the ATH ($0.00001156) again in the next few days. The overall trend is upwards according to my rudimentary technical analysis. If it reaches the ATH again, then the potential upside is +22% within the next week or so. 

**ATOM (Cosmos Network)**

Current Price: $8.60

Holdings: 40 ATOM ($344 USD)

Projection: ATOM fell off a cliff in Spring 2022 from its ATH of $44.70 down to a new floor of $6.07 (-86.4%). Since then, it's been oscillating back and forth, with a stable floor of $6.50 and a ceiling of around $14. On the shorter term, the floor is currently sitting at about $8.00, and the short-term ceiling is around $9.20. It's currently on a little upswing, and if it hits the short-term ceiling again, that's a potential upside of +7%. If it manages to reach the longer term ceiling of $14, that may happen within the next \~1 month based on the periodicity of the current trend, and would yield a much larger upside of +63%. Does that seem like a reasonable bet? 

**COMP (Compound)**

Current Price: $56.68

Holdings: 5 COMP ($283 USD)

Projection: Compound is currently sitting with a stable floor around $51 and a periodic ceiling of about $60. However, it has surged a couple of times over the last year: once in February 2024 when it went from $57 to $95 (+67%), and once in June/July 2023 when it went from $29.50 to $77 (+161%). There is also a small chance that it will surge even further; the ATH for this coin is $911.20. Does it make sense to hold onto this until the next moderate surge within 2-3 months? 

...

I also own some Curve DAO (CRV), some Optimism coin (OP), some Internet Computer (ICP), a little bit of Enjin Coin (ENJ), a little bit of BONK, and a little bit of Loopring (LRC). I may edit this post shortly to include writeups on those too, to get some opinions. If you've read this far, thanks! I'd love to hear what you guys think about this portfolio.

In a market filled with projects that don't last more than 2 days before everyone is left at a loss, the meme coin community is in search of a project designed for everyone to win.
A narrative with longevity and infinite momentum is what's needed to reinstate the trust and transparency that make crypto so revolutionary...
We've all had enough of the rugs and Ponzi-schemes designed to see who sells first!
$SHARE's roadmap is designed to leverage growing market cap valuations by attaching charitable crypto donations every time our coin meets a new market cap milestone.
As the market cap grows, so do the donations, and therefore the impact. This relationship is conceived to justify exponential growth without limit. The impact of the $SHARE community is directly proportional to its monetary value, both boundlessly growing.
Our tokenomics allocate 20% of the supply to the humanitarian wallet and 80% to the liquidity pool.
As §SHARE grows in value, the tokens in the humanitarian wallet will be donated to charitabl causes chosen by the community.
First of which is saving the bonobos at 1 million dollar market cao which it is at 100k about now.

More Details about What BabyXRP really is:

BabyXRP

Many malicious projects in the Binance Smart Chain space have thrived because of a lack of information for new investors in the space. By providing education and discussion regarding trading crypto, we change our investor’s lives by providing them with the tools they need to avoid those tokens.

Baby XRP provides a safe BSC token to invest in, with liquidity locked in perpetuity(1), and rewards in the form of Legacy XRP.

Rather than providing reflections in native token, or a buy-back mechanism, Baby XRP provides reward in Legacy XRP to reward holding the token and avoid investors being subject to the complexity of and impermanent loss seen when staking LP in farming apps.

Baby XRP also utilizes an automatic liquidity pool to replenish the liquidity of the token on every transaction. The contract will collect tokens from each transaction, adding them to the LP. This creates stability for the token and supports the price floor.

We use several mechanisms to encourage holding the tokens. We don’t use bots to manipulate price or attempt to pump and dump the token: The requirement to hold tokens for 3 days to get the XRP rewards will also encourage investors to hold.

The tax on each transaction is also an encouragement to hold. Every transaction is taxed 17 %.

(1) Liquidity is locked till 2099 using Dx.Lock.

In addition we provide an inclusive community with 24 hour voice chat to educate our fellow investors on how to trade safely, grow their money, and make smart decisions when investing on the Binance Smart Chain.

The project uses a fully doxxed developer team, further instilling trust and safety for the investors.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,sonicgrowsquidelonbitcoininu is a new generation memeshot token. Formed by community and run by community. Be part of the team just by having a bag and support the organised movements.,"We are built different and taking a step away from the “fcked up BSC mentality”

sonicgrowsquidelonbitcoininu name will be over the space. Community is getting larger and the chart is getting so bullish ATH after ATH. Floors increase with a low tax of 6% in every transaction.

Stealth launched on Binance Smart chain to prove that it will be from the bottom to top! The chart speaks for itself. LP is currently locked for 2 months to secure its investors. Its name is one of the most bullish meme tokens living at the moment. We have seen it many times, these names are all over the space. Just by the name you can confirm this will do good. It appears to be funny with a weird name but people loved it as they can see the community is like a family. Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 is a bullish count to reach its 1$ cost price per token. Its symbol is ""1B"" and it depicts a lot. A vision to create a space with a good environment of investment and make each other investors earn money. It has a bullish chart and never stops growing. One group is available at the moment, on the telegram attached below. It is an international movement. 1% of its taxes goes to the liquidity pool to help the chart's volatility and away from big whale manipulation. 1% goes to development. This includes the project's utility funding, hired personnel to do their job right and just, and building the project's fundamentals. 4% of the total taxes goes to marketing. It used to pay influencers, promoters, advertisements, and partnerships. This is a never ending progression TO THE MOON AND MARS. Community is creative and for sure can make a massive footprint that will live forever as a good token and a good community. There is no late investment for sonicgrowsquidelonbitcoininu. All bullish names in one universe, in one community, in one chart.

Everyone wants to believe in something. Enter memes, the supposed future of money according to enthusiastic crypto investors and, of course, Twitter. The term “meme” comes from Richard Dawkins’ 1976 book “The Selfish Gene.” A genetic meme, as described by Dawkins, is a gene that copies itself and proliferates throughout the species by way of Darwinian natural selection. A cultural meme is, similarly, a behaviour or idea that spreads throughout a culture even faster. If I share a joke with you and you share it with your friends, we create a ripple effect until the joke is known on a collective level, changing the species forever. Meme coins are all the rage in the crypto market. These cryptocurrencies have taken the world by storm with popular public figures backing them for long term viability
And when that joke is attached to an exchangeable value, it can theoretically become an actual currency. Whether the hype is warranted – and whether meme coins will actually have any lasting value – remains to be seen. But ones like dogecoin have already proven masterful at driving powerful narratives that have gained attention from the likes of Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, Elon Musk and former adult film star Mia Khalifa.Meme coins are cryptocurrencies that are inspired by memes and other viral online trends. Sometimes, meme coins themselves go viral, forming a community of enthusiasts. If the crowd grows big enough, interest piques, demand rises and the coin can gain sufficient value to be bought, sold and traded on crypto exchanges, just like Bitcoin.That level of vulnerability to outside forces is why meme coins are so explosively volatile, even by the standards of crypto trading. But that volatility is precisely what gives meme coins the ability to turn pennies into fortunes.If you had invested in Shiba Inu when it was trading at its low of $0.000000000056 in November 2020, according to Decrypt, and sold it when it hit its all-time high of $0.00008616 in October 2021, you would have enjoyed otherworldly gains of more than 150 million percent. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are considered success stories among meme coins. Meme coins are cryptocurrencies that have gained popularity in a short amount of time, usually as a result of influencers and retail investors promoting them online.Dogecoin is the original meme coin: It was created as a joke based on a meme back in 2013. It rose to fame after Elon Musk began tweeting about the cryptocurrency, and retail investors started buying in droves.By December of that same year, the meme had its own blockchain ledger thanks to software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who created Dogecoin as a satire to prove that cryptocurrency could literally represent anything.It remains history’s most famous meme coin and, nearly a decade later, Dogecoin is still big enough to be in an online slap-fight with Elon Musk, who became the world’s biggest crypto influencer with a single Dogecoin tweet last year.

sonicgrowsquidelonbitcoininu core team's value includes transparency, professionalism, and being competent. The memeshot of 2022 is born and this is the next banger! Community is organising movements together to market the token and invite more Binance Smart Chain investors to support the movement. It's aim is to be the next big meme token, cutting ties with the toxic and BSC culture and proving to everyone that with a genuine team and community, everything is possible. It is still a low mcap gem building, future moonshot is imminent. Don't miss the ride and also invite your families and friends to the rocket high pump. The project is backed with reputable people on the space. sonicgrowsquidelonbitcoininu's investors are most valued and for that this is community-based meme token.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,$KIN,"Seriously after the week for ripple and Btc, $KIN
Super moon 🌝 🚀 🚀 possibility.

1. Has gone through its battle already with the SEC and has been deemed NOT a security.
2. successful migration to the solona block chain earlier this month almost complete
3. Yet to be listed on any of the major user friendly exchanges (hit Btc largest)
4. al time high of .0012 hit in 2018 altcoin rush again without it being on any major exchange. 
5. 3million active spenders on KIN apps
6. Over 60 apps on the ecosystem already 
7. Built for mass usage and mainstream consumer micro transactions and payments which are becoming more and more valuable to developers, inviting more into the KIn Ecosystem 

With the talk of XRP being dropped from a lot of major exchanges because of its upcoming sec battle, has to put a lot of alt investors as well as exchanges on edge about EVERYTHING else. Since KIN however is literally one of only a very small handful who’s already been deemed not a security by SEC and in many coins cases (potentially XRP however you slice it), WILL in fact be labeled a security and be delisted or devistated with legalities. 
The second kin gets listed on coinbase  it will moon like crazy. ( and as an investor with a vested interest in kin reaching a penny I do hope the two, legal and SEC approved, American companies are speaking because it only makes sense for both of them, coinbase for its need for assets that won’t continually be torn apart by sec ((KINs already been through))and for Kin gets it to a point of mass adoption in front of the general public on an exchange like that) 

It’s been a ride but 2021 will see kin explode. Load the bags still pleanty of time. 🌝 🚀

Current price: $0.045

A little bit history;

Unification or $FUND started as $UND wherein they burned the 88% of their total supply (1billion) and undergo mainnet this past May 14th, swapped $UND to $FUND at 1:1 ratio and considered $UND as a testnet after swapping and, $FUND as their mainnet.

https://medium.com/unificationfoundation/the-unification-new-genesis-event-88-of-und-supply-destroyed-37fa56484396?source=collection_home---4------7-----------------------


Introduction:

Unification is a hybrid public/private blockchain that connects interoperating private WRKchains to a public Mainchain. Any independent entity can deploy useful scaled solution, via WRKchains and exchange data in closed environments. WRKchains can support any DApp/smart contract and may have their own native coin (or not), all while maintaining speed and scalability.



Technology:

Beacon - Beacons are the best choice for singularly maintained centralized databases that require an element of trust added

WrkChains - WRKChains are a Distributed Ledger Technology designed specifically for real-world enterprise and consumer adoption

TokenForge - TokenForge is Unification’s WRKChain infrastructure that allows for a consortium marketplace based on tokenization


My opinion:

For me, this token is such a vast industry. 
Unification created a solution for enterprises wherein if blockchain will be used in enterprise data operations, it will clogged the network because of heavy loads. And here they are, crafted the WkrChains, it is the fucking perfect solution that world needs. If I compare Neyma to Sergey, they are almost the same, who built the perfect blockchain/token to maximize the usability and scalability of blockchain.
Also, Neyma the CEO of $FUND has connections to GOOGLE and RIPPLE.

Imagine, private companies, enterprises and Governments will start using WrkChains. As time passess by, $FUND will eventually grow higher and higher and higher.

They already have a working WrkChain named as ""FinChains"", it is a decentralized price oracle developed by Yellow, it is estimated to consume more than 500k to 1million $FUND a year.

Imagine, when the adoption phase begin, there are a lot of $FUNDS will be used in utility. I don't care what you say, but for me this project is belong to top 50cmc, for short 100m mc,  x37 from here.
Worst case is top 100cmc at 50m mc, x18 from here.


Don't missed out on this one. I highly suggest it to add it on your portfolio.
If you missed out on LINK, NEO, UBT ico days. 
Here's your chance.


Tokenomics;

Explorer: https://explorer.unification.io/

Circulating supply : 93,851,203

Total supply : 120,000,000

Staking: YES


There are 49 million tokens currently at perma stake by the company to secure the network at 51% attack. This will be locked forever for the security of the network.
This is equivalent to 1/3 of total supply.


Also, 10m $FUND will be minted each year that will bring the total supply at maximum of 210 million by the year 2029. But it will be locked and will only be used to sell for enterprises for utility usage and to pay for network tax (block rewards) it means, the more WrkChains will be deployed, there will be ""DEFLATION"" because it will be used by enterprises etc. If those 10million minted $FUND each year is not sufficient for enterprises, they have to MARKET BUY the $FUND tokens.

Good tokenomics tho.

Conclusion:

You can apply the law of supply and demand in this token. Wherein scarcity will happen and will boost the token's price a lot and also consider the 49m permanent stake which is 1/3 of the total supply.
Which means only 71 million are in the circulation. If this will be listed to another 5 more exchanges, the demand will increase which will give a massive boost to the price. Plus, add those incoming WrkChains deployment which will use about an estimation of 500k to 1million $FUND per year for utility usage.
Their main goal this 2020 is to deploy 100 WrkChains. Imagine the scarcity. It will be above the rest.
They worked hard 2 years for this perfect solution. Silently working and here they are, going to make a name in the industry.

Try looking out for the flaws of this project.
If you have any, kindly comment it here.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Ezillion Digital Assets Seamless Transition: double rewards staking system that is profit-sharing utilities and token reflections.,"Ezillion's mission is to solve the problems currently hindering public access to crypto custodial services. It will achieve these goals by integrating security, simplicity, and accessibility cryptos into one platform.

**The Ezillion Ecosystem**

Ezillion strives to put ""cryptocurrency in every portfolio."" The platform establishes a break in the ecosystem to attract more people into digital assets to achieve this. By holding the Ezillion tokens for a long time, users may generate passive income while maintaining their privacy, authority, security, and autonomy. 

Notably, the ecosystem is based on reasonable monetary regulations and a robust decentralized foundation, and it is divided into a launchpad, staking platform, NFT marketplace, and BEP-20 token.

**Ezillion NFT Marketplace**

Ezillion NFT is a critical component of the NFT ecosystem. Ezillion Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) are one-of-a-kind, non-transferable assets created on-chain. These tokens can be associated with anything, including digital EZI.

The crypto business has struggled with transparency, verification, ownership, provenance, copyright, and forgery for a long time. Furthermore, the sector has traditionally been confined to the privileged who can afford to invest millions of dollars in a single work of art.

Ezillion NFT marketplace can create, mint, sell, buy with multichain options. Users can select their preferred chain such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain. Meanwhile, Ezillion NFTs cannot be replicated and transferred without the user's permission, hence secure. 

**Ezilion Staking** 

Ezillion is launching a staking platform that will allow investors, even newbies in blockchain, to stake Ezillion tokens. The platform offers a double rewards staking system that is profit-sharing utilities and token reflections.

Ezillion integrates on the Binance Smart Chain. Binance holding ensures the protection of its customers' funds by deploying unique security techniques and providing a Secure Asset Fund for Users . The platform's staking method is arguably one of the safest and most environmentally friendly ways to generate passive revenue.

**Ezillion Token**

EZI is a BEP-20 decentralized cryptocurrency based on the Binance Smart Chain. EZI is the currency needed to transact on the various distribution modules associated with the Ezillion decentralized application. Token owners have the option of staking their tokens in the Ezillion wallet to receive special rights and rewards within the network.

**Tokenomics**

The EZI token has a total supply of 1,000,000,000,000,000. Ezillion will burn 50% of the tokens to reduce the supply of the tokens to increase demand. Another 20% will go into liquidity to keep the tokens in supply. 

The presale will use up to 20% of the tokens. Furthermore, the unlock will use up 10% of the tokens, with a private sale taking up 3%, the airdrop 0.5%, team vesting 5% (Locked for 365 days) and CEX listing 1.5%.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Statera - The Liquidity Pool Supercharger (10M Marketcap Gem),"Statera is a deflationary index fund catalyst. It works by being inserted in multiple different liquidity pools with an AMM (autobalancing pools). Because of the deflation there will be constant imbalance meaning the volume is much higher than in other regular liquidity pools. The wrapped version of Statera (which doesn't burn itself directly) is in a pool with regular Statera on Uniswap. Whenever an event of autobalancing occurs that includes either Statera or Wrapped Statera, there will be a ripple effect throughout the entire Statera ecosystem and all the pools creating more volume everywhere. This also creates arbing opportunities out of thin air, which in turn leads to even higher volume. Prior to Statera the deflationary tokens have failed because they haven't had a purpose, this is not the case with Statera as the deflation is both genius and crucial to how and why the ecosystem performs so well. The deflation also works on a macro level as the supply decreases (will never reach absolute zero) increasing positive price pressure of the token itself.

Seems too good to be true? What about the contract and the devs? The contract is fully audited and IMMUTABLE. The dev team own less supply than some of the top holding wallets, after a flash-loan attack that happened on Balancer where they refunded 2M USD worth of tokens. They didn't have to do this, they were fully anonymous and Statera was a small cap project, yet, they did it.   

Are you wondering why the price dropped so much before it just now started taking off again? There was a whale with 6M tokens who dumped all of it over the course of months. As soon as he was done price did a 4x up to 0.12 from 0.03, but another unfortunate event happened as a Statera whale with 900k tokens downloaded metamask as a .exe file and got scammed for all his tokens. The scammer sold all tokens in a matter of days which caused price to drop back down to 0.05-0.07 cents for a while. It's one of the most if not THE most battletested and most decentralized token out there. It has survived everything and the community (consisting mostly of 4chan's /biz/ users for now) has started calling it ""unkillable"" and ""inevitable"".

Quoting the Balancer devs ""Statera works so well it's almost like it's gaming the system"".",66,2021-01-18 15:48:12,36

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,STATERA = The BTC of DeFi!,"[Statera](https://medium.com/@stateraproject/statera-phoenix-e80d77c44f7b) is an index fund is a fund that can track a specified basket of underlying investments and in this case: BTC, ETH, LINK, and SNX all ""balanced"" with STA. These coins are set in the fund at a specified percent so as one goes up or down the others are automatically bought or sold to balance risk and maximize profit. 
HOWEVER, the key is that STA is deflationary (whenever a STA transaction happens for buying/selling/pooling, 1% of said transaction is burned). This token burn along with tokens being locked in pools, pressures prices up to again make sure the other coins will be balanced, but also creates arbitrage opportunities across funds. 


 
Why is increasing volume, liquidity and arbitrage useful with STATERA? 
Well while pooling STATERA you earn a percent of all transaction fees in the liquidity pool. Please feel free to read the medium article outlining the first 2-3 months which came out to be an APY of 36% creating dividends where there were none.
The power of STA is that the ripple effect of: (1) compounded fees, (2) token burn, (3) price pulled by balancing with ETH, BTC, SNX and LINK leads to an exponential effect and positive feedback loop on price. This leads to the concept created by STATERA known as ""Volume Farming."" 


 
Can the team dump? 
No, this is the most decentralized token as the project much like BTC is out of Satoshi's hands, STA is out of the hands of the devs who only own <4%. In fact, I own more STATERA than some of the devs. ",43,2020-10-13 17:12:51,41

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Statera - Anyone looking at this? A deflationary index fund?,"What is an index fund?

An index fund is a fund that can track a specified basket of underlying investments and in this case: BTC, ETH, LINK all balanced with STA.

The rules are that these coins are set in the fund at a specified percent so as one goes up or down the others are automatically bought or sold to balance risk and maximize profit. HOWEVER, the key is that STA is deflationary (whenever an STA transaction happens for buying/selling/pooling, 1% of the transaction of STA is burned). This token burn + tokens being locked in pooling pressures prices up to again make sure the other coins will be balanced. You also are given a % of all the fees paid in STA transactions up to 36% APY and during a run up to 40,000% APY.

The power of STA is that the ripple effect of: (1) compounded fees, (2) token burn, (3) price pulled up by ETH, BTC, and LINK leads to an exponential effect and positive feedback loop on price.

Can the team dump? No, this is the most decentralized token as the project much like BTC is out of Satoshi's hands, STA is out of the hands of the devs who only own <4%.

In short, Statera:

1. Increases positive price pressure and decreases volatility - caused by the deflation
2. Gives one token access to the ecosystem, price action of assets its pegged to, and benefits of arbitrage
3. Deflation can be put into any index fund (Balancer pool) or other financial instrument
4. Deflation rewards loyalty, if you get in early when supply is high, as supply goes down assets get more valuable
5. Diversification - You can hold many assets in the ecosystem
6. Passive income- make money while you hold your crypto (over 30% APY)

TL:DR

In simple terms the Burn function of STA is designed to create volume. In a way Statera discovered ""Volume Farming"".",46,2020-08-15 17:47:18,40

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Is PepeGains the next Pepe Of Wallstreet ( POW ) ?,"The crypto market in the last period is going crazy. A lot of people are now excited about the memecoins season led by Pepe. Previously, the dog memecoins like Shiba, Floki, Babydoge, and Dogecoin were leading the memecoin journey. But now, it's the frogs' time.  
**POW ? The secret of success.**  
In the last few days, we have seen a new project Pepe Of Wallstreet developed by some early pepe holder  
but this coin has a blacklist function that does not allow some people to sell their tokens, which has   
**POW (Pepe Of Wallstreet) price prediction.**  
POW is still creating new ATH almost every hour, and a lot of people are waiting for it to reach the highest levels on the chart.   
It's pretty hard to predict the next target of POW. It depends on teamwork, marketing, and the decisions of the first investors.  
**Is PepeGains the next POW?**  
There's a new Better project called PepeGains, created by the brother of the Pepe developer. It has better ideas, utility, and an ecosystem. The utility of PepeGains is passive income generation, and the passive income will be received in Pepe. Every sell transaction will allocate 7% to directly buy Pepe, which will then be distributed to PepeGains stakers. So here we have a project with passive income utility.  
Additionally, the project is hyper-deflationary. 2% from every sell transaction is being sent directly to the burn wallet, making this gem rarer every day.  
**Pepegains price prediction.**  
Considering the low supply (500 million) and the deflationary tokenomics, the price prediction of Pepegains suggests it's easy to reach 1$. For long-term holders it will be profitable because the longer you hold, the more Pepe rewards you receive, and the more tokens are burned from sell transactions. As you know, Ripple (XRP) is not deflationary, and its circulating supply is twice that of PepeGains, yet it reached 3$.

As of now you CANNOT buy them, so the only way to get your hands on these rare pieces of NFTs, is by participating in their Technical Review Contest! Here’s what they posted on their Telegram earlier today:

“*The Technology Review Contest is a monthly contest series accessible to ALL members who are passionate about creating, sharing, engaging, and developing the Rebellion community. Winners get some of the very first NFTs. Check one of the NFTs* [*here*](https://3009042573-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FAyhlh8IK9NHKSqy2Y228%2Fuploads%2FCRJyVxcXcEnlhJNh2yMx%2FGuerillerro.mp4?alt=media&token=927ceb38-6531-419e-9871-1fc66a1f57d4)*. Let’s get started with the February Contest topic on “Investment DAO”.*” 

To participate in the contest, you will find more info in their Telegram group at this post’s link here: [https://t.me/RebellionProtocol/65657](https://t.me/RebellionProtocol/65657) 

**About Rebellion Protocol**

The Rebellion Protocol is a crypto focused venture capital (VC) fund that is entirely on the blockchain and 100% driven by the community, through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

The project stems from a simple question: Can we create, by pooling the knowledge of a massive amount of people, an investment vehicle that generates an alpha above average classical crypto VC funds?

The answer was to build a venture capital fund, fully on the blockchain, where the community makes decisions and with mechanics that generates ripple effect throughout its entire ecosystem, that is virtuous and exponential, and therein provides some of the highest financial returns ever created by a VC fund.

Rebellion Protocol is structured in a simple manner. Anyone can buy the Rebellion token ($REBL) and therefore become a VC investor. The Protocol does not raise money, it takes fees on its token transactions to finance its VC fund. So, no need to spend enormous time on roadshows (which don’t create value) or answer to big institutional investors. In fact, the project answers to no one except its community. The community governs the project through the Rebellion Protocol Decentralized Autonomous Organization (REBL DAO).

The project’s VC fund invests in promising blockchain projects, ideally at a pre-sale stage, and aims to achieve a minimum of 10x or 1000% returns over the investment period. It therefore deploys funds with a mid to long-term investment horizon and  focuses on projects with a compelling use case, strong teams/backers/advisors, healthy token economics and is agnostic to blockchain technologies or trends.

&#x200B;

**How does it work**

\- Swap BNB for $REBL

**STEP 2: Mint your NFTs**

\- Stake $REBL

\- Stake min 12 weeks to get the chance to win ultra-rare NFT

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Regarding: STATERA,"FULL DISCLOSURE: I am a lurker and this is my first post. I frequent /biz/ and I am a top 25 wallet holder of STATERA. Please understand that my intention is not to shill but to generate discussion regarding the pros/cons of the following project as a possible moonshot.

&#x200B;

To begin this discussion, I will ask, ""What is an index fund?""

An index fund is a fund that can track a specified basket of underlying investments and in this case: BTC, ETH, LINK, and SNX all ""balanced"" with STA. These coins are set in the fund at a specified percent so as one goes up or down the others are automatically bought or sold to balance risk and maximize profit.

HOWEVER, the key is that STA is deflationary (whenever a STA transaction happens for buying/selling/pooling, 1% of said transaction is burned). This token burn along with tokens being locked in pools, pressures prices up to again make sure the other coins will be balanced, but also creates arbitrage opportunities across funds.

&#x200B;

Why is increasing volume, liquidity and arbitrage useful with STATERA?

Well while pooling STATERA you earn a percent of all transaction fees in the liquidity pool. Please feel free to read the medium article outlining the first 2-3 months which came out to be an APY of 36% essentially creating dividends where there were none ([https://medium.com/@stateraproject](https://medium.com/@stateraproject)).

The power of STA is that the ripple effect of: (1) compounded fees, (2) token burn, (3) price pulled by balancing with ETH, BTC, SNX and LINK leads to an exponential effect and positive feedback loop on price. This leads to the concept created by STATERA known as ""Volume Farming.""

&#x200B;

Can the team dump?

No, this is the most decentralized token as the project much like BTC is out of Satoshi's hands, STA is out of the hands of the devs who only own <4%. In fact, I own more STATERA than some of the devs.

&#x200B;

Can’t I just hold BTC, ETH, LINK or any other coins and balance my own index fund?

Yes, but can you add in a way to collect dividends (>36% APY) on your coins based solely on their volume/trading? Can you add in a mechanism that causes constant upward pressure in your index fund? Can you capitalize on every arbitrage opportunity for all the above coins to auto-balance and make gains when possible 24/7? Can you do all of the above in a trustless and truly decentralized (largest holder \~6% of supply) manner?

&#x200B;

What is the low volume/high volatility problem?

If an asset or contract has low volume then it is susceptible to high volatility. This leads to the premature failure of many promising projects and contracts early in development and is one of the main barriers to a fully decentralized and digital world. A simple quant balancer cannot solve this as in finance 1.0 because if the volatilty is too high then such a balancer is subject to fail also. However the addition of a deflationary mechanism creates inherent feedback ensuring that it cannot fail unless the entire digital market (ETH, BTC, LINK) collapses. It allows new projects and new contracts to solve the initial growing pains of high volatility and manipulation.

But what if bad actors simply manipulate STA?

This is why the fully decentralized aspect is important.

&#x200B;

But what if no one uses it?

Then it fails. However, here are some possible reasons to support why it will be used include: First-mover advantage (FMA) and simply put, people are already using it. If BAL and subsequently Phoenix go on coinbase then it will not be long until STA is cemented as the industry standard. However, this is the key. If we do not utilize this tool then it will fail. This does not mean we need more people buying it. But more people using it and allowing it to be integrated into their pools, funds, contracts, etc. If more projects integrate it then new buyers are not necessary and therefore new holders of STA are not needed to generate income using STATERA as a community balancing tool.

&#x200B;

Why is the price so low if this project is so promising?

This project was greatly anticipated, and it is still very young (4 months old) and it was very bullish since its inception. However, BALANCER labs was hacked utilizing the STATERA deflationary mechanism which has since been fixed utilizing the Delta token. Even more impressive is that STATERA and then BAL refunded the tokens lost during the hack which given the steep increase in price of the tokens we far more money than the initial investors lost. Crypto YT personalities such as Bitboy crypto, Chico Crypto and Ivan on Tech have all promoted STATERA with Ivan and Bitboy promoting STA and the applauding the refunds separately.

&#x200B;

So why is this a moonshot?

Given how young this project is and the rapid growth it has had from $0.03 to a local peak of $0.46 followed by a correction to $0.15-$0.30, it has garnered great interest in /biz/ where it is now behind chainlink as one of the most promising projects for a ""long-term hold"". The number of holders continues to grow and is currently at \~4400 with volume rising regularly and recovered significantly since the price dip from the BAL hack. However, despite how bullish the community are, it is still only a 11 mill mcap to 30 mill mcap coin. Given the use case and integration with blue-chip coins it is not unreasonable to see it achieve an mcap of a top 50 coin, but that is conjecture on my part. Beyond this the project's team is actively working on new ways to increase liquidity, volume, transaction fees, arb opportunities, etc. by getting STA listing on multiple new exchanges including 5 new exchanges coming in September, 2020, and new integrations and pools for STATERA to balance.

&#x200B;

I am happy to discuss price projections and the calculations that went into it, but the current models used for price prediction will need to be taken with a grain of salt given the assumptions made in the models (BTC reaching 80k by EONY, for example). For now, I am happy to have had your attention. Please let me know your thoughts and recommendations as they are greatly appreciated.",66,2020-09-02 21:25:44,29
XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Coinbase Relists $XRP: 5 Cryptocurrencies That Deserve A Listing,"The partial victory of Ripple ($XRP) against SEC has taken the crypto world by storm. From a significant price rally to Coinbase relisting the digital payment network’s token, it has been an eventful week for Ripple. First $BTC reached the $30,000 mark, and now this. The market is ripe for more such development that could finally catalyze the beginning of a much-awaited bull market.  
  
Irrespective of what happens next, Coinbase relisting $XRP is a big move that could pave the way for the listing of more fundamentally-strong emerging projects. In this blog, I discuss 5 such tokens that Coinbase should consider listing.  
  
5 Tokens That Deserve To Be Listed on Coinbase  
  
1. $KDA (Kadena): $KDA is the native token of Kadena, a public blockchain network that aims to improve scalability with its enterprise-grade Layer 1 solution. It addressed two key issues that traditional blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum face — scalability and security. Kadena uses the altering “braided multi-chain mechanism” to offer improved scalability and enhanced security. With developers actively looking for alternatives to Ethereum, $KDA has a huge market opportunity in front of it.  
  
2. $FTM (Fantom): Fantom is a smart contract-powered blockchain powered by $FTM, which aims to establish itself as an alternative to the Ethereum network. Fantom facilitates faster and more cost-efficient transactions. Launched in 2019, Fantom is a direct threat to Layer 2 solutions like Solana that aims to somehow reduce the challenges that the Ethereum network faces. $FTM has also been a favorite of crypto investors since the previous bull run.  
  
3. $VET (VeChain): We have another Ethereum alternative on the list. Powered by $VET, VeChain is a leading enterprise-grade Layer 1 network that aims to fuel a sustainable and scalable blockchain ecosystem. The VeChain economy is powered by two tokens — $VET and $VTHO. Being a low-carbon blockchain gives $VET an edge over other Layer 1 solutions. It definitely deserves to be listed on leading exchanges like Coinbase.  
  
4. $MNW (Morpheus Network): $MNW is the native cryptocurrency of Morpheus.Network, a blockchain agnostic supply chain management solution with partner networks in 5 different continents, a global clientele. They have partnerships with enterprise clients like Gulftainer, Vitalcan, and Senasa. In the world of hype, $MNW shines as a utility-based project. If utility is what exchanges are chasing, $MNW surely deserves to be listed on top exchanges like Coinbase.  
  
5. $AGIS (SingularityNET): How can we complete this list without including a project that’s bound to make it big amidst the AI wave? Whether AI tools will eat up jobs is a question for the future. However, technology is bound to bring along much-needed disruptions. SingularityNet, powered by $AGIS, is a decentralized marketplace for AI algorithms. It is the first and only platform that allows AIs to cooperate and coordinate at scale. The platform allows users to effortlessly “build, share, and monetize” Artificial Intelligence services. SingularityNet brings along a combination of both hype and utility.  
  
Conclusion  
  
The recent relisting of $XRP on Coinbase has opened up possibilities for other fundamentally strong projects to be listed on the platform. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, it is essential for exchanges like Coinbase to consider adding tokens that offer unique solutions and have a promising future. Among the tokens that deserve a listing on Coinbase, we have highlighted five noteworthy projects. Kadena ($KDA) stands out with its focus on scalability and security, offering an attractive alternative to Ethereum. Fantom ($FTM) aims to provide faster and more cost-efficient transactions, posing a direct threat to Layer 2 solutions like Solana. VeChain ($VET) fuels a sustainable and scalable blockchain ecosystem and has the advantage of being a low-carbon blockchain solution.  
  
Morpheus Network ($MNW) shines as a utility-based project in the realm of supply chain management, boasting partnerships with enterprise clients worldwide. Finally, SingularityNET ($AGIS) is an exciting project in the AI space, offering a decentralized marketplace for AI algorithms.",0,2023-07-17 14:08:54,1

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,"New Token - BABYXRP has launched! This token rewards diamond hand holders in XRP every 7 days, this is already big and will only get bigger!","Welcome to Baby XRP

Baby XRP presale sold out in 10 seconds! I was linked into this in a chat in another group and after being in the telegram for a few moments, I realised, I want to be on this trip! 

The coin was wider released on pancake swap last night, I witnessed a flurry of buys waiting for some sells for a better entry point, I got my wish, now with the paper hands out the token looks to be making great progress, a new ATH by the end of today is certainly on the cards in my opinion. The current market cap is $553,360 with $170,517 locked in the liquidity pool. 

This is just the start, the devs are very ambitious and are working hard to market and push this token to 10 times what the current market cap is, maybe even 100, who knows, I really think this is a great entry point, and I really think this is a moonshot!

Let me tell you more about the token

There is 

A 2% Burn

Baby XRP is a deflationary coin, meaning that as time goes on the total supply will reduce. 2% of every transaction will be sent to a dead wallet being burned from the total supply forever, increasing the value of the remaining tokens

5% to Marketing

Baby XRP is here to stay! 5% of every transaction will be sent to the marketing wallet, to be spent on future marketing and advertising, to ensure that we will continue to attract new investors and holders.

5% to Liquidity

5% of every transaction will be sent directly to the liquidity of the coin itself, This ensures that the Liquidity keeps a healthy ratio in comparison with every holder and Marketplace.

5% Ripple effect - this is the new shit!

To be eligible, starting 2 hours after the launch you need to hold for 7 days. 

Every 7 days all DIAMOND hand holders will get an equal amount of XRP airdropped to their wallet.

Interested? I though so!

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,BOBZcoin Manifesto: the Future of ‘Sick’ Entertainment," 

In the early days of the 2020 pandemic a small bar in Long Island took a leap of faith into macabre, sinister entertainment. This leap was a rudimentary betting pool on whether Chicago or NYC would experience greater gun violence over the Labor Day weekend. It garnered local media attention, and a fair amount of outrage, the authorities attempted to shut it down, but failed. Bobzcoin wishes to expand on that story, allowing its users to place bets not only on gun violence, but violence of all causes, overdose deaths, terrorist attacks, when and where the next school massacre will occur, vehicle related deaths and Wars etc….

Coin Functionality

Betting on Bodies will have a peer-to-peer betting system, one where any two parties can take bets on gun violence, or other categories that are outside the mainstream and would be considered morally precarious. Users will have the ability to bet against one another utilizing a secure p2p protocol., e.g. All funds associated with a bet will be placed in a secure wallet controlled by the administrators, this will allow us to expediently distribute funds to the winners and ensure that parties do not back out of a wager. The administrators will charge a small holding fee, no more than 10% of each wager.

Tokenomics

When a user purchases a BOBzcoin via pancakeswap, they will receive 85% of the value purchased. 15% of their purchase will be allocated as follows: 10% is sent to a secure wallet held by the BOBzCoin team, this will be used exclusively for Development, Marketing and Management. 3% of every purchase will be allocated to our holders. The amount each holder receives will be based on the amount of BOBzcoin they currently hold, the more a holder possesses the greater the amount received. This 3% is often referred to as a ‘user tax’. 2% will be burned in a secure wallet. When coins are burned at a controlled and steady pace, this gradually increases the value of a coin. 

Ethos

While the self-righteous, pretentious crowd of clowns may attempt to cancel or drown us out, they fail to grasp the true nature of humanity. We enjoy watching others suffer, we relish violence, we embrace chaos. Most of us are constrained by the shackles of mundane lives, insipid relationships and a life trajectory that offers little in the realm of invigorating excitement, Bobzcoin will capitalize on our darkest impulses. Bobzcoin will not judge those who want to see others fall victim to gun violence, we will not cancel those who express violent desires, we will never view something as too violent to indulge. 

As we all engage in the perpetual rat race imposed on us by modern western society, we fall further into the abyss of a cultureless environment, dominated by concentrated wealth held by a small number of corporate conglomerates, buttressed by a corrupt government. These institutions are not there to help us or protect us, they exist only to further enrich a decadent and hedonistic ruling class. As power and autonomy has slipped from the grasp of the everyday normie and eccentric autist, the BOBZcoin community wishes to expose the absurdity and cruelty of modern society.

Cancelling cancel culture is one prominent object we seek to achieve. By normalizing and embracing the worst aspects of humanity we will render the superficial and manufactured virtue of the ruling elite null and void. How can one stomach the twisted ideology of modern society, individuals have had their livelihoods destroyed, families broken apart and thrust into the oblivion and indignation of cancellation by expressing views that do not adhere to a narrow and perverse mainstream narrative. Canceling someone is a death sentence. You are not abruptly or with immediate effect ending their existence, but you strip them of their financial support, ability to communicate (as the majority of information mediums are controlled by major conglomerates), and lastly, they are robbed of their dignity. Deaths from despair have grown exponentially over the past decade, this is not a coincidence, this is a direct ramification of the exploitation that the ruling class enforces and then demands we emulate on a micro level, via the perpetual rat race.

Why BOBZcoin will work

The world is quickly descending into rapid, irreparable disrepair. Wars are ubiquitous, the environment is inhospitable, supply chains are strained exacerbated by growing geopolitical tensions, and societies are being torn apart by socio economic and demographic changes. All this chaos will lead to one constant, Violence! Death, Destruction and Chaos will only go up, like a stock promoted by the apes on Wall Street Bets, there will be nothing to stop the indomitable rise of BobzCoin. 

Per all the reasons listed above, people are irate, pent-up frustration is ready to explode. The elites want us to remain silent, to suffer and accept their positions of power as warranted, as opposed to stolen. We know that is Bullshit! As this perverse society tears itself apart, let's set aside the virtue signaling and embrace violence. People want this, people want to become Bobbers, they want to watch this sick society burn down! Therefore BOBZcoin will work. Let’s shoot to the moon, while the clowns and sycophants shoot each other.",1,2022-04-06 07:26:59,19

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,2 10x moonshot within the next 30 days,"My apologies if these coins are within the top 100, but I think it can be made an exception if they can do a 10x.

# Introduction

With the incoming launch of Q, IOTA is about to offer what 28 platforms within the Top 100 are offering \(!\) and they are probably looking to replace several more.

1. Smart Contracts: Cardano, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Aeternity, Zilliqa, Rchain
2. Oracles: Aeternity, ChainLink
3. Currency Exchange: Bitshares, ZRX, Cryptonex, Achain, Req
4. Outsourced Cloud Computing: DBC, Aelf, Golem
5. Scalable Currency: Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Gold, Nano, Bitcoin Diamond, Dogecoin, Digibyte, Decred, Bitcoin Atom

I expanded my search to the top 1000 to see if I could find platforms that can do the following things and compete with IOTA for a massive vision. I found 2 platforms, which offer the following 7 things next to IOTA.

1. Zero fees
2. Instant transactions
3. Near infinite scalability
4. 1 millionth the energy usage of Bitcoin
5. Massive funding
6. Massive development power
7. Massive vision to take the whole market

This brings us to 3 platforms which aim for juggernaut status

1. IOTA \- $6B market cap
2. Elastos \- $300M market cap
3. Skycoin \- $200M market cap

Now, IOTA is already quite big, but the other 2 aren't.

The reasons why I think they will do a 10x within the next 30 days is, because Skycoin will be listed on 5 large volume exchanges and Elastos on 7 exchanges. Currently, Skycoin is only on Cryptopia, though with a bigger daily volume than Ethereum already and Elastos is only on Huobi.

Here is some more info about Skycoin and Elastos with my estimates. IOTA will probably make 4x and go from $8B market cap to $30B with the release of Q in 3 weeks and be at the same level as Cardano and EOS, which both offer less functionality than IOTA.

# 1. Skycoin will go from $180M market cap to $3.6B or more

Have you seen the series HBO's Silicon Valley, where Pied Piper is building a decentralized internet that is not run by ISPs, but by IoT devices?

This is exactly what Skycoin has developed with Skywire over the last 5 years, making telecom providers like Comcast, ISPs who can control bandwith, cost, net neutrality, filters, access etc. obsolete and completely decentralize them by having everyone offering bandwith from their own devices.

There are exactly 3 reasons for the big incoming price increase

1. A few months ago, there was a huge FUD campaign launched against Skycoin suppressing the price, with baseless facts that were disproven quickly. Since then, Skycoin has continued development, ignored rumours, only cared about building their tech and is now about to launch their flagship product Skywire. The FUD campagin is still running, under each Skycoin post, there are always comments how crap and how much of a scam Skycoin is without providing any facts.
2. When a good coin is listed on a major exchange, there is always a big increase in price, sometimes even 5x \(Mithril\) With the launch of the Skywire testnet on 15th May, Skycoin will list on 5 \(!\) large volume exchanges. These 5 exchanges will probably include Binance, Huobi, CEX, Bitfinex. This is massive and I don't think has happened before for a coin to be listed on that many large exchanges at the same time.
3. Some of these listings will include having FIAT tradepairs \(!\) for Skycoin itself. Source: [https://np.reddit.com/r/skycoin/comments/8hgr29/roadmap\_2018/](https://np.reddit.com/r/skycoin/comments/8hgr29/roadmap_2018/).
4. Similar to Elastos, Skycoin scales horizontally and is thus is near infinitely scalable and also very decentralized.

# 2. Elastos will make a 10x and go from $300M market cap to $3B.

Elastos started out as a mobile operating system 18 years ago and has now moved towards a smart contracts platform, operating system and a runtime environment for Dapps. Here are 2 very strong reasons why Elastos will most probably experience a big price hike within the next 30 days.

1. Elastos has outstanding fundamentals and will be listed on 7 exchanges within the next 30 days [https://www.reddit.com/r/Elastos/comments/8h2oaa/lets\_talk\_about\_exchanges/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Elastos/comments/8h2oaa/lets_talk_about_exchanges/). Not all of them are probably among the top 10, but there are probably 2 or 3 of the biggest exchanges in the group.
2. Thanks to side\-chains they are near infinitely scalable and is thus also very decentralized. They are probably the most decentralized cryptocurrency that currently exist next to Skycoin. Correct me if I'm wrong.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,$SIG - most overlooked moonshot of 2021,"xSigma (SIG) is a stablecoin exchange and liquidity mining platform. It aims to be a better version of Curve.

[Website](https://xsigma.com/)

[CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xsigma)

[Telegram](https://t.me/xsigma_global)

[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FpkMHJq)

**Fundamentals**

1. Currently at a $12.5 million market cap (Curve is at $785 million)
2. Backed by publicly traded company ZK International, listed on the [NASDAQ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/zkin)
3. Team has engineers from 1inch, Google, and Ripple
4. Fully functional platform with $138 million TVL - [ranked #42](https://debank.com/ranking/locked_value) on DeFi rankings below Loopring
5. Endorsed by [Ivan on Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1P4evVYqjI) and even NBA champ [Dwight Howard](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLC_F6vnguO/) lol

**Technicals**

1. Huge hype at launch caused high demand followed by a sharp drop into price discovery [like many Uniswap listings](https://imgur.com/a/OMmDRAr)
2. Massive >$4m liquidity consistently for the past week
4. [Number of holders](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7777777777697cfeecf846a76326da79cc606517#balances) have more than doubled in past five days
5. Solid tokenomics and extremely rewarding distribution to LP's, read more on whitepaper [page 8](https://xsigma.fi/xsigma.whitepaper.pdf)
3. Bullish RSI, test pump looked good, ripe and ready for a moonshot


**Liquidity Mining Info**

It's really simple to get started by just following the [quickstart guide](https://docs.xsigma.fi/). The enhanced 2x rewards for early LPs already ended, but now rewards are at 1.5x. You can check how much time left or passed before or after the bonuses and halving:

- [First 2x bonus period ends](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/12082780)

- [Second 1.5x bonus period ends](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/12244060)

- [First halving](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/12761500)

- [Second halving](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/13601500)

**Vision**

This team has a ton of cool stuff coming. For example, a [gas cashback program](https://xsigma-lab.medium.com/introducing-gas-cashback-for-xsigma-traders-5621f4b15824) for its users.

Later this month they're adding staking with only SIG tokens without needing to pair.

They also [announced](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zk-internationals-subsidiary-xsigma-eneters-non-fungible-token-market-projected-at-1-3-billion-in-2021-as-it-announces-the-launch-of-its-nft-platform-on-ethereum-and-polkadot-blockchains-301247211.html) an NFT platform to be launched on Ethereum and Polkadot.

**Overall**

Given the company background, team, rapid user growth, alluring early rewards program, along with exciting new developments in the pipeline- I believe SIG demand will continue to grow as they gain market visibility. I do think they can do better marketing to acquire new users though it seems they're just focused on dev for the time being. I recently picked up a large bag to get ready for SIG staking to complement my current liquidity mining. Hoping to continue seeing growth on this new project as I acccumulate more SIG. As always, DYOR!",22,2021-03-24 00:01:50,20

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,The Future of Gaming is in the Metaverse. The Kusunoki Token!,"When Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would be changing its name to Meta, it caused ripples throughout the industry. Such a significant shift from one of the world’s most valuable companies created a groundswell of interest in this concept of a metaverse. Zuckerberg is betting that the next frontier of technology is going to be in fully immersive virtual worlds that will become the home for work and play alike.
 
It’s difficult to bet against this when you consider the rapid advancements that we’ve seen in virtual reality, augmented reality, and the associated hardware that make all of this possible. It seems inevitable that as things improve, we will spend more and more time in metaverses of various kinds.
 
 
**How Will This Affect Gaming?**
 
Video games are a massive industry and they often lead the way in terms of adopting new technology. If you look at how the internet and streaming in particular changed the way that the industry operates, you get a sense of how quickly gaming adapts and adjusts to new paradigms. This will be no different.
 
Game developers have an opportunity to create the sorts of virtual worlds that can transform the gaming experience forever. The metaverse offers a level of escapism that is hard to fathom until you experience it for yourself. As we have been building Kusunoki Samurai, our spirits have been buoyed by the intense realism and simultaneous interactivity that is possible when you build in the metaverse. This is very clearly the future of the industry where you can interact with a 3D world in real-time, exploring without constraint, and living the lives of your characters.
 
It’s a game-changer.
 
 
**How We Think About the Potential of the Metaverse**
 
Our game Kusunoki Samurai will be built to be metaverse-first. We’ve worked hard to lean into this future, and we are confident that the technology is there for us to create an authentic 14th-century environment for our players to engage with. Through a combination of augmented reality and virtual reality, we hope that our game will act as a beacon for what is possible in this new metaverse-centric future.
 
Early adopters who see the potential here and build accordingly have a chance to radically transform the gaming industry, leading the way as we march towards what seems to be inevitable. There will of course be growing pains along the way but there are enough tailwinds here to accelerate wider development and adoption as time goes on.
 
Our game will be at the forefront in this exciting new canon that will challenge the status quo. We will start to see a convergence of VR-realism, crypto-based micro-economies, and internet-enabled global communities. Bringing these together promises to craft something that we have never seen before. This is the gaming of the future and we’re incredibly excited to play our part in it.
 
If you’d like to follow along on the Kusunoki Samurai journey, we’d love to have you along for the ride! Watch this space, the gaming industry is in the midst of a serious inflection point.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,"MetaLand reached 300K Market Cap, 100X Soon! MetaVerse Project [Doxxed Team & CoinMarketCap Listing within 24Hours]","METALAND is a metaverse token based virtual world allowing users to create, build, buy, sell and rent digital land or other assets in the form of a non-fungible tokens inside the game.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,NYZO,"Nyzo is very new, having just launched in December 2018. The coin is not yet listed on CoinMarketCap, which means it has flown under everyone’s radar until now.

The purpose of this crypto coin is to create a mesh network. This is a unique utility not possible through Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other coins.

A mesh network is a type of internet framework in which participants share resources with one another. This enables them to build bandwidth through one another, versus relying on a centralized Internet Service provider (ISP).

There is huge demand for mesh network infrastructure in areas where service providers are dangerous or predatory. Recently, a meshnet by protestors In Hong Kong, has risen as go-to medium for messaging as it cannot be shut down by Chinese government forces.

Nyzo operates through its novel “Proof-of-Diversity” mechanism. In essence, each participant in Nyzo further bolsters the mesh network. They are rewarded for their participation as they contribute to the greater diversity of the network. The better diversity, the stronger the network.

Nyzo is the only blockchain coin in the world that operates under this system.

Trading Nyzo

Each Nyzo coin trades for roughly $0.20. With a --at the time of writing-- circulating supply of 7,950,000, the market cap is only 1.9 million. Keep in mind that coins like Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple are worth tens of billions of dollars.

Nyzo was launched fairly, there was no ICO and the founders do not control a portion of the supply. This indicates that there are no major entities that are looking for a quick return on investment.

Right now, there is a passionate community silently building out and accumulating Nyzo. In its current phase, the coin looks similar to RaiBlocks crypto coin when it was only trading for fractions of a penny. Months later, it traded for over $35.

Nyzo holders are anticipating gains in the tune of thousands of times return on investment. While the cryptocurrency is still a hidden gem, it’s the perfect time to buy in.

If you bought $100 worth of Nyzo today, and it grew to become a top 20 coin, you would then have somewhere around $100,000.

Where to Buy Nyzo

The best exchange to buy Nyzo is QTrade. This is the perfect exchange because they are regulated in the United States but do not require users to verify their identity.

This sophisticated project brings excellent variety and cutting-edge technology to the table while requiring the most negligible fees.

With up to five sources of reflection, the Y-5 Token is a pioneer in the blockchain industry. You will obtain Evergrow, Relfecto, Crypter, Rematic and BUSD just by holding onto Y5. When it comes to receiving reflections, the Y-5 Community will choose between over 10,000 tokens, including popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple (XRP).

Users that possess Y-5 Tokens will earn a 15% on every transaction in Evergrow, Reflecto, Crypter, Rematic and BUSD. While the total supply of Y-5 Tokens is 1,000,000,000,000,000, 45% of total Y-5 Tokens will be allocated to pre-sale and early liquidity and 50% will be transferred to the burn address, 3% to the founders and crew, and 2% to marketing. 1% of each transaction is converted to liquidity, and 4% is a strategic repurchase, establishing a long-term stable price floor.

**Autoyielding on Y-5**

Later on, the contract will be updated to automatically yield up to 5 tokens of your choice. This will be a smooth transfer, which means that users will not be required to do anything during the transfer. In order to get reflections in their preferred tokens, individuals may go onto our dashboard and make their selection, based on their objectives and preferences.

Besides, the auto LP staking mechanism will be launched as well, so that token holders may stake their tokens in order to obtain access to up and coming projects with the least amount of risk. By staking the tokens, users will receive 0.05 percent of each transaction of future tokens, at the same time achieving this with minimum downside.

**Decentralised Applications of Y-5**

Furthermore, the platform's objective is to empower developers to create decentralised apps (DApps) and to assist consumers in managing their digital assets cross-chain with minimal latency and high capacity. Numerous benefits of dApps are related to the program's ability to protect user privacy. Users of decentralised applications do not need to input personal information to utilise the app's functions. DApps use smart contracts to enable transactions between two anonymous individuals to be completed without the need for a central institution.

Through our dApp Dashboard, which is constantly updated and supported by the community, comprises a Swap exchange with a user-friendly interface that enables real-time viewing of Rewards earned. Our Ecosystem has limitless potential, which is enabled by our staff, which is the ideal blend of brains and brawn, ensuring that each investment has a personalised experience.

We aim to create a protocol for frictionless yield farming and liquidity production that operates autonomously. Hence, we will move part of our liquidity to our Partnered Tokens via the use of an ingenious collection of smart contracts for Staking Pools by purchasing them on specific contract interactions. The acquired tokens are subsequently divided to the Pool's members. This principle underpins the long-term usefulness of our currency, since staking X token to gain Y token makes economic and mathematical sense.

**Project Values of Y-5**

In the blockchain industry, trust is extremely important. Therefore, this requires absolute transparency in all facets of community and development activity, as well as security initiatives. Transparency is something that we hold dear. Hence, our team will be doxed and will only have a% stake in the company, which will be locked for six months. Certik will audit the team and confirmed that Y-5 has completed all KYC requirements.

Moreover, longevity is paramount for our project, which seeks to remain resilient through the continuous waves of technological innovation. As a result, we aim to guarantee that Y-5 remains on an upward trajectory by implementing a buy back mechanism.

**Y-5 & NFTs**

Our Marketplace, which is based on BSC, will enable NFT owners to simply borrow against their NFTs as collateral at competitive interest rates without needing to sell their NFTs first. This implies that anybody can make substantial profits from their NFTs rather than having them simply sit in crypto wallets.

By using our platform, anybody may purchase and sell NFTs in a variety of ways, including those obtained via liquidated collateral from the NFT Lending platform. This creates a highly competitive market for buying NFTs at a discount to their typical market value. In addition, the marketplace will have a minting tool that will let users produce their own NFTs using photographs, videos, and other types of information.

Considering the multiple case application, innovative technologies and resilience of Y-5, its emergence being a landmark in the evolution of the token industry.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,KAVA. Estimated gains: 10-40x by Q4 2020.,"I've seen two attempts in here that were rather bad. This is what you need to know:

Kava is a defi lending platform like Maker, where people can escrow their crypto and borrow against it. This is called a CDP (collateral debt position).

MKR is limited to ETH and ERC-20 tokens. This makes KAVA the first to market with CDP's for crypto's like BTC, XRP, BNB, LINK and ATOM. These will be added 100% and stakers can vote on more additions later. 

You know the XRParmy and LINKmarines are not selling and will double down with a CDP like ETH hodlers did.

After ~1 year, MKR has around 400million locked in CDP's and has a marketcap of ~500million. KAVA's marketcap today is ~12 million and the potential marketcap is arguably the same (if not higher than) MKR. 

This will give you an opportunity for a 40x on a 1 year timeframe.

I've seen some scepticism on circulating supply and total supply (this is the reason it's not already too late to buy imo). Let me address this:

Circulating supply is 13.6 million and total supply is 100 million (wtf i hear you say). The inflation of KAVA will go directly to the stakers (it's currently at 7%, with the max at 20%). As long as you are staking, you have no inflation. Besides that, Fees on loans will be paid with KAVA and the fee's will be burned.

Staking fee's are normally 10% of the earnings, but Binance is going to offer feeless staking very soon (like they did with XTZ. They are already running a KAVA validator as we speak). If you can't wait a year, you could also play the ""Binance free staking pump"", when it inevitably happens.

I could tell you how great the team is, (CEO is a founder of FNATIC, which is very successful in the gaming industry. He is not a coding expert, and that is why the project runs on the Cosmos SDK. There are some influential backers like Xpring from Ripple (haters gonna hate) and Binance (haters gonna hate) is obviously going to jumpstart adoption, by accepting the new stablecoin (USDX) users borrow to spend in the Binance casino.

If you haven't bought by now, i can't help you.

Edit: 

A little addition. Some people calling this a ''premined shitcoin'' really don't understand what is up here. This is a governance token which gives you part ownership of the DEFI platform. Besides that there's added utility with fees being paid in KAVA (which the users dont have to see or be bothered with). 100% of the tokens are allocated to investors,KAVA Labs and retail that bought through the Binance launchpad. Calling this a premined shitcoin is like calling AAPL stock a premined shitcoin. I'd almost think I'd be better off posting this stuff on 4chan..",10,2019-12-10 04:44:27,24

WHITEPAPER OUT ON OUR WEBSITE

10% of ⚠CLASSIC COIN98⚠ is re-distributed to the holders with COIN98!

COIN 98 is a Multi-Chain Wallet & DeFi Gateway that is certainly making waves at the moment.

Our first objective as holders of COIN 98 from day 1 is to generate profits, taking advantage of the well-deserved hype of the main currency by redistributing a part of it to the holders so as to increase the volume of COIN 98 as well.

Trading takes place on PANCAKESWAP 🥞 and for each transaction this happens:

🏅 8% Transaction Fee to Buyback $Coin98
💰 7% Development Fee
💰 1% Liquidity Pool
💰 4% Extra Fee on Sell 


We suffered the birth of a myriad of Pancakes, Ripple, Cardano Rewards Token , most of which turned out to be scams. So we decided to create a legitimate Reward Coin, that would reward holders with the coin we think will be the game changer of 2022. Coin 98 (multi-chain liquidity aggregator that supports assets across a variety of blockchains, including but not limited to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Tron). WE WILL ALL USE THAT SOON OR LATER.

Safu dev 🟢 | Lp Locked 🔒 | 1000x potential 🔥

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The Weekend Cheems is the first 100% community driven systemic exponential growth cryptocurrency project. 

&#x200B;

The project stems from a simple question: Can we create together a project that is so strong that it elevates an entire community to financial freedom and subsequently makes the established financial system irrelevant? 

&#x200B;

The answer was to build a cryptocurrency with the kind of systemic growth that generates ripple effect throughout its entire ecosystem, that is self-enhancing and exponential, and therein displays overwhelming momentum and moves with unstoppable force.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,"After GME, Dogecoin and Bitcoin, Chinese Traders Are Betting What Will Pump Next","Rallies in GameStock (NYSE: GME) shares as well as dogecoin (DOGE) and bitcoin (BTC) are piquing the betting interest of traders in China as much as they are in the United States.

On Weibo, the popular social media platform in China, the highly active crypto community is speculating on which cryptocurrency will be next to get a major pump after dogecoin and bitcoin jumped in recent days.

“Were it not that Ripple was struggling with its lawsuit, the next token being pumped by the retailers in the U.S. could have been XRP,” according to one Weibo account holder with nearly 40,000 followers. “Many newcomers to crypto only look at prices and names, and they do not care how many times this particular token has taken away people’s money or whether it is highly centralized.”

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,🍼 🐶 Welcome to Baby Jeju 🐶 🍼 ✨. Presale coming this week! Dev has successfully launched tokens to 20m+ MC. This will be no different. Come to the telegram and see for yourself!,"✨ 🍼 🐶  Welcome  to  Baby  Jeju  🐶 🍼 ✨

With all the new hype reward tokens it was only a matter of time before Jeju presented to you the first and best project of it's kind. Tired of rugs? Faulty codes? Rewards that don't work? Rewards that you don't want? Well here's the solution! 

We are the first project that will allow you to choose which dividends you want.

The way this works is simple but elegant, On every Transaction there is a Tax , that tax coverts to a pool which then rewards the holders in the selected dividends. 

This means instead of receiving tokens in reflections you will be able to receive from a selection of multiple dividend pools.

So far we have the following selection for the public to choose from at any time.

🔸 CAKE - Pancake Swap Token
      LINK - Chainlink
🔸 XRP  - Ripple
      BUSD - Binance USD
🔸 ADA - Cardano
      ETH - Ethereum
🔸 BTC - Bitcoin
     BAKE - Bakery Swap Token
🔸 TRX - Tron
      XTZ - Tezos
🔸 BNB - Binance Token
      Doge - Doge Token

The original jejudoge hit a Mc of 5million so can definitely be your next moonshot. The Dev has successfully created a variety of tokens and reached 20mc on a few of them.  With Btc hitting 40k we are in the next phase of the crypto bull run and jeju launch will be through the moon. 

An incoming bull market, based dev with amazing track record, a successful team, a an amazing community already behind it, perfect tokenomics, catchy name, proper whitepaper and road map, safe and guaranteed to be a mooner



We are the first token to implement this idea and we are super excited to bring this concept to Binance Smart Chain!

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Why is TITAN (Iron Titanium) Is So Valuable,"Original post by Jending at r/TitanCommunity  


So everyone knows how to make TITAN more valuable, right?

Buy a lot, burn a little - buy a lot, burn a little. It's not very complicated.

However, TITAN's value will also rise if other values fall. Let me explain.

Currently, there's a landmark courtcase being litigated between Ripple and the SEC:

[https://www.rollcall.com/2021/05/04/ripple-case-seen-as-precedent-for-cryptocurrency-regulation/](https://www.rollcall.com/2021/05/04/ripple-case-seen-as-precedent-for-cryptocurrency-regulation/)

The central issue is whether Ripple's cryptocurrency - XRP - is a Security. If it is - if Ripple loses the case, and the SEC forces Security Registration - then they can force the developers of every other coin to register too.

Everyone is watching. The implications are enormous. This guy clarifies things:

[https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1435603055278497792?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1435603055278497792%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1\_c10&ref\_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Ftwobitidiot2Fstatus2F1435603055278497792widget%3DTweet](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1435603055278497792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1435603055278497792%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Ftwobitidiot2Fstatus2F1435603055278497792widget%3DTweet)

""XRP as a security also means other assets will meet the same fate.""

Unless, of course, that asset is TITAN.

TITAN has no developer, no foundation, no Board of Directors, no central third-party of any kind; there's no one to force Security Registration on! Please understand, I'm no lawyer, but I don't see how anyone would classify TITAN as a Security. And that's what makes it so valuable.

The SEC is not backing down:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/10/29/sec-chair-genslers-war-on-crypto-is-about-his-resume/?sh=606b5d4c76a9](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/10/29/sec-chair-genslers-war-on-crypto-is-about-his-resume/?sh=606b5d4c76a9)

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,"What happened with Divi last night, and why it matters","Last night [Nick Saponaro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicksaponaro/) CEO of Divi Labs, primary developers of the [Divi Project](https://diviproject.org/) confirmed a detail that will have ripple effects on the price of [Divi ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/divi/)for months to come. While [Bitcoin Price Predictions](https://investorplace.com/2021/11/bitcoin-price-predictions-one-industry-expert-says-btc-can-rocket-to-1-million/) may rocket to $1 million, in cryptocurrency, Divi is the altcoin to watch.

To understand the significance of this revelation, we must first take you back to the initial description of this deal.

In this section of the video, (link below)  Nick alludes to “Patent-pending IP for  earning crypto in one tap from a smartphone AND $12,500,000 licensing  deal.” If after watching this video you have more questions than  answers, follow along.

The next bread crumb in this trail was laid in Nick’s [Live@5](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiviProject/videos), the monthly project update.

We learn here that a telecom wants to license Divi technology to  subsidize the cost of data in developing nations. The cost of the 4G/LTE  data is subsidized by the Divi node that is on the device. The company  has “many many” customers. This “opens the doors to millions of  customers for Divi.” Nick also says, “It was very difficult to close,”  meaning that this is a done deal.

It is with this context last night Nick answered this question from  the AMA, “Will the nodes on the cellphones for the telecom deal be  simply using Divi licensed technology, or will they also be using the  Divi coin. Answer: “They will be using the Divi coin.” I would love to  have a recording of this for you, but it was a Twitter Spaces  conversation, and no recording was made. Pop on over to the [telegram community to chat with](https://t.me/diviproject) many people who heard this first hand.

What does this mean? Well, this morning we have been crunching the  numbers. If the telecom only were to subsidize 2 million customers (the  absolute minimum for what Nick calls millions) and they only subsidize  the data at $1 per month, then at a current Divi price of $0.07 this  would mean investing $120,000,000 into Divi, to buy 1.7 Billion Divi.  With Divi’s current market cap at $205 million, this would be a  significant influx, bringing Divi from a top 300 market cap coin to a  top 200 market cap coin.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,The Need and Importance of Blockchain Interoperability,"
The concept of “blockchain interoperability” refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to exchange and leverage data between one another and to move unique types of digital assets between the networks’ respective blockchains. In an interoperable system, once disparate blockchain networks and assets can easily plug into and be combined with one another. This network interoperability may allow for the creation of powerful new products and services that leverage the benefits of multiple blockchain networks simultaneously. Now let me tell you why I think blockchain interoperability is great for investors and everyone in general:
 
Benefits of Blockchain Interoperability
1. Customizable Web3 services:
Many experts argue that interoperable smart contracts could supercharge industries like healthcare, law, or real estate, for instance by allowing important business information to be sent back and forth between private networks and public networks in a customizable and controllable manner. Blockchain interoperability may also eventually enable multi-token transactions and multi-token wallet systems, which would greatly streamline the crypto user experience.
 
2. A more decentralized ecosystem:
While pure decentralization within individual blockchain networks is a top priority for many blockchain projects, the ability to establish network interoperability across multiple blockchains presents an even more advanced embodiment of blockchain technology’s promise to decentralize systems and economies.
 
3. Enhanced cross-industry collaboration:
Blockchain technology has a wide range of industry-specific use cases, but ultimately the primary benefits come down to data transparency and verifiability, smart contract execution, and decentralized consensus. Once blockchains used by different organizations and industries are able to interact with one another, independent markets and business applications that were previously considered entirely separate will be able to more easily transfer data and value.
 

How Is Blockchain Interoperability Achieved?
Most existing Layer-1 blockchains lack built-in features that support cross-chain interoperability. However, there are a variety of tools today that are increasing the level of interoperability between blockchain networks:
·       Sidechains: A type of Layer-2 platform, sidechains are separate blockchain networks that are compatible with a single mainchain. Each sidechain has its own consensus mechanism, security parameters, and tokens.
·       Oracles: Within the context of blockchain technology, oracles bridge the information gap between on-chain and off-chain environments.
·       Bridges and swaps: Cross-chain bridges enable a digital asset owned by a party to be locked on one chain while an identical asset is “minted” on another chain and sent to an address owned by the original owner.
 
There are many companies today offering blockchain interoperability and some of the best ones like Veruseum, are building next-gen fast and low-cost value transfer networks. It can validate all chain transactions off-chain. Hence, it can efficiently handle complex statements over the blockchain state by hiding the linkability of senders and recipients and reducing overall communication and data stored on the ledger by compressing several transactions into a single record.
Ripple is another excellent example of a blockchain project trying to explore cross-chain transactions. While it is still in the early days of development, Ripple is trying to make it possible for people and entities to exchange various digital assets across different blockchains.
 
Have you used any such blockchain interoperability projects yourself? I think it is a great feature available to investors nowadays.",1,2021-11-16 17:43:49,3

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,XRP - huge upside opportunity,"Not investment advice and also not stocks so feel free to get rid of this post if it’s against the rules but I’ve been monitoring a situation I think people in this sub might be interested in.

3 years ago - ripple coin (xrp) was the 3rd largest crypto coin behind Bitcoin and ethereum until the SEC slapped them with a lawsuit causing the price to tank, and for exchanges (coinbase, etc) to delist. Prior to the lawsuit - analysts noted - and still do - the very strong utility of ripple - nearly instant and nearly free transactions.

The sec’s law suit hinges on the belief that XRP is a security unlike bitcoin + ethereum. 

Fast forward to today and after a few months of hearings it’s trending extremely well for XRP, in my opinion - it is trending to a decision where if XRP is a security, so is Bitcoin + ethereum - which would have huge market implications and I believe the judge won’t want to touch that.

A few days ago, xrp lawyers won the right to see the Bitcoin and ethereum initial analysis from the SEC causing the price to 4x in a week. The SEC did not want these documents shown as it may force the judge to see that the 3 cryptos are similar - whether they’re all securities or none of them.

Given a small hearing win took the price up 4x, there is insane potential here. The upcoming events that could occur to moon xrp r exchanges relist and eventually ripple wins the case .

Even if ripple loses the case - in the short term there will only be gains. Do some research and let me know what y’all think",10,2021-04-10 16:03:07,6
XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Posted from r/cryptocurrency,"I also posted this in r/cryptocurrency - but I also wanted to see what my cowboy cryptocurrency buddies had to say about this.

---------------

I have been lurking this sub for many months and only a few days ago started buying crypto.  Very low stakes at this point, but I started.  I found an app called Newton (I'm in Canada, the free no minimum options seem limited) which is really easy to use.  It seems very limited as far as choice goes - with maybe 10 coins available to buy or trade.  Long story short I bought a small sliver of BTC, some Stellar, some Ripple, a piece of Litecoin, and a piece of Monero.  They all lost a bit of value over the last few days - nothing major though.  But then I started looking into their historical values and I realized that in just the past 4 weeks they have all gone on such a wild ride.  Stellar had a monthly low of $0.10 and a high of $0.29.  I checked the others and they all had at least that big a swing, it not even more pronounced.

So my two questions are - is this extreme volatility the norm?  And is this volatility the way you guys make most of your profit?",4,2020-12-05 12:25:12,9

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Atomic Wallet Coin is SHOCKINGLY Undervalued ~750k Market Cap,"`<NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE>`

Hey, /r/cryptomoonshots! Its my first post here (woo!)

&#x200B;

I’ve been lucky enough to have found QNT and LTO from this subreddit. I’ve found a third project that looks extremely interesting and I’d like to share my research here. My background is in digital marketing and this project stood out to me, especially from a marketing and biz dev perspective, which I’ll share below.

&#x200B;

Feel free to correct the record if I’ve posted anything incorrect and I will update it (I’m a human being, I make mistakes, okay!) Additionally, the CEO is constantly answering questions on Telegram!

# The project is Atomic Wallet Coin. $AWC

&#x200B;

* Market cap is \~750k at the time of writing this
* 1 AWC = $0.075
* Circulating supply is \~10M
* 40k active users
* 150k+ downloads
* Currently only available to trade on IDEX

&#x200B;

**TL;DR IS AT THE BOTTOM. ALWAYS DYOR. NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.**

# WHAT IS ATOMIC WALLET?

Atomic Wallet is a non custodial crypto wallet for desktop and mobile. Users can exchange and buy 300+ cryptocurrencies from a single interface. The wallet can perform cross-chain atomic swaps.

&#x200B;

It’s an exchange built into a wallet.

&#x200B;

Shapeshift and Changelly are partnered with Atomic to add additional currency swap pairs + fair rates. Fiat/crypto gateway is supported directly through the app.

&#x200B;

Atomic has over 40,000 monthly active users and boasts 150k+ downloads.

&#x200B;

The project is one of the first to migrate over to Binance chain. They are currently in the process of getting listed on Binance DEX. Half of their supply will remain ERC-20 and the other half migrated to BEP-2.

# 20 FULL TIME EMPLOYEES AND CEO WITH PREVIOUS TRACK RECORD

Konstantin Gladych self funded Atomic Wallet with his own funds. He previously was the CEO and co-founder of Changelly, a fully compliant crypto exchange service which has been around since 2013 and has serviced over 2 million users across the world.

&#x200B;

“Changelly's trading algorithms are integrated into large and reputable trading platforms, such as Binance, Bittrex, Poloniex and HitBTC” - Wikipedia

&#x200B;

Konstantin holds a PhD in data science/machine learning and left his CEO position at Changelly to develop Atomic Wallet full time.

&#x200B;

The team currently consists of 20 full-time employees - 6 developers, 7 support and community managers, 6 marketing and business development, and 1 designer.

# APPROVED WALLET BY NEO FOUNDATION, ZCASH, GEMINI, LISK, AND OTHERS

Atomic Wallet is trusted by many household names in crypto. This does NOT mean Atomic is “partnered” with these companies, however it adds massive credibility to AWC considering they trust it enough to add it as a recommended wallet on their websites.

&#x200B;

# 95,000+ UNIQUE VISITORS PER MONTH TO [ATOMICWALLET.IO](https://ATOMICWALLET.IO)

&#x200B;

[traffic statistics for atomicwallet.io \[pic\]](https://i.imgur.com/BDzudXM.png)

&#x200B;

Atomic Wallet has an A+ marketing team.

&#x200B;

Here’s a quick snapshot of how well [atomicwallet.io](http://atomicwallet.io/) is performing (see above). They’ve gone from 0 to 95k unique visitors per month in well under one year. Purely from Google search traffic. This doesn’t include traffic from Twitter, Facebook, and other sources. It also was during the worst bear market in crypto history, when these search terms would be at a low.

&#x200B;

Let’s see how Atomic Wallet measures up against some well-known sites:

&#x200B;

[myetherwallet.com](http://myetherwallet.com/) 802k/mo

[Ripple.com](http://ripple.com/) 580k/mo

[Ledger.com](http://ledger.com/) 401k/mo

[Exodus.io](http://exodus.io/) 172k/mo

[Atomicwallet.io](http://atomicwallet.io/) 95k/mo

[Freewallet.org](http://freewallet.org/) 70.9k/mo

[Trustwallet.com](http://trustwallet.com/) (Binance owned) 24k/mo

&#x200B;

Atomic Wallet has virtually caught up to or exceeded many of it’s competitors in terms of traffic in well under a year. Turning this traffic into downloads/new users is child’s play. It’s one of the reasons this company with 20+ employees is already profitable in just a few short months.

&#x200B;

So, how is this site getting so many visitors?

&#x200B;

Here are a few search terms that [Atomicwallet.io](http://atomicwallet.io/) ranks on page 1 for on Google.

# $AWC TOKENOMICS

Atomic’s website does a thorough job of explaining the tokenomic details of the $AWC coin. The tokenomics mirror the standard use-cases you would expect from an exchange token (Bibox, KCS, etc.) The CEO recently expressed his interest in adding staking rewards for AWC holders. He is also exploring the idea of having IEO-type listings for Atomic Wallet users/holders in the future. New projects could theoretically debut directly on their platform and be traded against $AWC, similar to how Bitmax runs IEOs.

&#x200B;

Currently, 90% of the circulating supply is locked up and Konstantin has announced his intention to buy back and burn tokens with company profits.

&#x200B;

**Here are a few of the use cases for $AWC:**

* Staking rewards for holders
* Discount on exchange services
* Discount on buying crypto with bank card
* Extra features for trading desk service
* Dedicated support managers
* Payment for coin listings
* Affiliate and bounty rewards

&#x200B;

**The team is looking to make $AWC directly tradeable from the app in the future.**

&#x200B;

With thousands of new Atomic Wallet users per month, this is an incredibly exciting feature.

&#x200B;

[https://atomicwallet.io/token](https://atomicwallet.io/token)

&#x200B;

# FINAL THOUGHTS

Atomic Wallet will grow to an active user base in the millions. Every crypto holder needs a wallet. Atomic provides a user-friendly wallet for newbies getting their feet wet in crypto. Most newbs aren’t going out and buying a Ledger/Trezor right away. Building an exchange directly into the wallet provides a safe and easy way to trade crypto assets.

&#x200B;

The number of cryptocurrency users and addresses are growing exponentially. Atomic wallet was created during the bear market. They are perfectly positioned to take a massive share of the increasingly competitive crypto wallet market during a bull market/alt coin season.

&#x200B;

In my opinion, they’re on track to be the #1 desktop/mobile multi-crypto wallet.

&#x200B;

As someone who is experienced in search engine/digital marketing, these guys have an ace marketing team. Even beating or ranking just below Coinbase for many competitive Google search terms in just a few short months.

&#x200B;

I have zero doubts that they will blow past every single one of their roadmap goals, especially as Bitcoin continues to climb in value and more people start buying crypto.

&#x200B;

Despite short term fluctuations in price, Atomic will continue to onboard thousands of new users every single month. The traffic numbers don’t lie. The Google search rankings don’t lie. Atomic will need to be wise about how they monetize this traffic.

&#x200B;

The company is already profitable. The CEO is well connected and has proved he is highly competent in creating and successfully running a crypto exchange.

&#x200B;

I have a lot more info to share about this project if there is interest, I’ll post a part 2 or a follow-up in the comments.

&#x200B;

**A profitable company of this caliber with 20 full-time employees isn’t justified at a \~$750k market cap.**

Statera (STA) is a smart contract powered Indexed Deflationary Token (IDT), which synergizes with a trustless and community driven portfolio of class-leading cryptocurrencies.

Every trade for Statera creates an arbitrage opportunity. Trading attracts liquidity, which in-turn attracts trading. Liquidity ripples and the supply of Statera decreases.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,"Hello, everyone! For those who are constantly looking for undervalued projects with low capitalization and huge prospects, I advise to pay attention to the project called Trustlines Network. And that's why .","About Trustlines network

&#x200B;

Currently there are multiple issues limiting broad adoption of cryptocurrencies. 

They do not fit into the current economic reality where money is mainly created as debt by banks and the capital cost incurred when people provisioning cryptocurrencies is prohibitive. 

Moreover, the requirement of upfront deposit money, having a bank account, dependency on centralized, 

often non-regulated, cryptocurrency exchanges, lack of user-friendly user experience and the necessity to deal with cryptocurrency transfers are hindering adoption. 

&#x200B;

As a solution we offer the Trustlines Protocol - a decentralized, permissionless and open platform to host currency networks. 

The value in these currency networks is represented in IOUs (abbreviation for ‘I owe you’) issued by its participants. 

The design extends on the original Ripple idea with a strong focus on ease of adoption. 

The platform is designed in a way that there is no need to interact with any centralized services such as banks or exchanges. 

Besides, it comes complemented with a reference implementation of a mobile application.

&#x200B;

The Trustlines Protocol is an open-source technology stack that provides a highly accessible medium of exchange. 

Its core idea is to provide an accounting system based on peer-to-peer credit. 

This is a highly accessible financial tool since any two people who trust each other can decide to open a credit line at any time, 

without typical restrictions like needing a bank account or identity documents. 

Credit is a powerful medium of exchange: 

Even if someone does not have access to national currency (fiat money), the credit created on Trustlines Protocol could be used in its place.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Moonshot advised by Randi Zuckerberg!,"Maybe I’ve been sleeping all time, but I’ve only recently discovered Pledgecamp. And definitely wanna share it here and get your opinions.

“Pledgecamp is securing the future of crowdfunding with blockchain protected investments.”
It is a decentralized platform that aims to solve longstanding issues of trust and misaligned user incentives in crowdfunding.

Why do I think it’s a moonshot?

 a) It’s a real use case for crowdfunding, a multi billion dollar industry

b)advised by **Randi Zuckerberg** (Founder/CEO Zuckerberg Media), Matt Curcio (VP Data at Ripple), and Keith Teare (Founding shareholder at Techcrunch)

c)Campaigns of founders on Kickstarter are in the top 1 percent of campaigns on the platform

d)Top Investors: LD Capital, Foundation X, Du Capital, Link VC, the Saudi Royal Family (through Prince Abdullah), and more.

e)Platform is built by MetaLab (metalab.co) which built **Slack** and **Coinbase** 

f)You can use your coins as real money to buy real innovative products, therefore  is is sort of risk-free  investment

g)Already has key partnerships with startup accelerators in Korea (FuturePlay), Europe (Humanity 2.0), and is pursuing more before launching the platform.

h)Partner - Laudato Si’ Challenge (https://lsc18.org/) is a startup accelerator with a partnership to launch new portfolio companies as creators on Pledgecamp. The esteemed accelerator receives the support of the Vatican in Rome, Italy to incubate for-profit companies aiming to solve humanity’s biggest challenges.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Why you should invest in Asch (XAS)...,"




I present to you Asch (XAS):




XAS also known as ASCH is a chance for a potential moon mission similar in size to ETP, ANT, WTC and OMG.




This picture compared Asch to other coins





https://ibb.co/dbnsJc




Unlike most of the Chinese coins in the above list, XAS was actually an insanely hyped and popular project in CHINA that received a lot of support from it’s community. However due to unfortunate timing its momentum was killed of by the sudden China FUD. I bet most of you are not familiar, but during that time XAS was also branded as the Chinese LISK, and was acknowledged by most to have even superior underlying technology.




Asch (XAS) has already been in development for a while (3 years). XAS had the largest trade volume at jubi.com before the Chinese government ban on ICO, even higher than Neo and WTC combined!




Asch (XAS) is an ethereum like platform that adopts an enhanced DPOS consensus mechanism created to reduce the skill threshold required from developers in creating Dapps. They bridge this gap by adopting JavaScript as an application development language and by supporting RDP (Relational Database) to store the transaction data. More importantly, Asch’s unique sidechain-as-a-application (SaaA) mode alleviates the blockchain inflation issue, as well as makes dApp much more adjustable and individualized. Asch is a prospective, low-cost, one-stop solution that will become the incubator of next generation decentralized application.




These are the distinctive features of ASCH compared to LISK:




Supporting side-chains (cross-chains). 2.DApp data are stored in the side-chain, so the main chain data will not swell too fast.




The Advantages of Node.JS language.





Saving block data in relational database to reduce the difficulty of dApp development




The speed of block production is rapid. Producing one block per 10 seconds and confirming it fast.




There will be no forking issues.




Safe sandbox isolating mechanism





Asch founder, Qingfeng Zhang, is a well respected figure in the block chain industry. He has worked as a development engineer in Kodak,YunYun and Weibo during his early years. In 2012 he was drawn to bitcoin, in 2013 he built a Ripple gateway and in 2016 he started working full-time to develop ASCH. Qingfeng Zhang is only the tip of the iceberg, they have 7 other core developers of similar reputation.






Asch’s github https://github.com/AschPlatform/aschhas also been very active and I can see them starting to form a lot of partnerships soon, and make a new push towards rebranding to the western market.




https://www.asch.so





Asch already has several Dapps launched on their platform by developers, unlike some other projects who are only based on hype, some of them are:





CCT- A distributed and decentralized social news sharing and communication platform.





Killing chain- World’s first multiplayer online battle royal game based on crypto currency made by developers of Bilzzard entertainment and Ubisoft. https://killingchain.com




KM wisdom- A decentralized predictive market application running on blockchain Many more Dapps are in progress, but still not completed, the above are already done and running.



In addition to Dapps on their platform, Asch is also already done with their mobile wallet+ web wallet and are in the final phases of completing their desktop pc wallet.

🔥/🔥An insider look at their platform is soon to be released. The platform itself is set to launch at end of 2021!

🔥6400+ holders and counting!

🔥CMC and CG listed already!

**👉 What is PawnMyNFT project all about?**

This is a revolutionary new project launched on BSC. It uses a platform and smart contract to support lending on Non-Fungible Tokens. PawnMyNFT will let you put any Ethereum NFT up for collateralization.

Other users can offer you a loan on that NFT. If you accept a loan, the funds get paid out from the -Lender's- account to you, and your NFT gets locked in a smart contract. Once you repay the loan, the NFT will be transferred back to your wallet. If you DON'T pay back the total repayment amount before the due date, the asset will be forfeited and transferred to the 'Lender'.

**💲Are they CMC and CG listed? Yes! Take a look! 💲**

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pawn-my-nft](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pawn-my-nft) 

**👉 Which blockchains are included?**

PawnMyNFT will initially offer lending on ETH blockchain NFTs with other Blockchains following after. Upcoming compatibility to be available on Solana, Polygon-Matic, Binance and more.

**👉 What are going to be the other features of the PawnMyNFT platform?**

✅P2P Lending Platform - find loans for your NFTs!

✅Rarity tools and Checkers - check and explore rarity for different NFT projects!

✅Social Upvote System - Check rankings and vote for listed NFT projects... -encourage the developers of your NFTs to register with us at

✅NFT Collateralization

✅Multiple Blockchains

✅Powered by Smart Contracts

✅NFT Project Advertising - ad space will be available for NFT projects to promote their art!

**👉 This is all too complicated! Give me an example!**

📍 for example Merk Quebarn has a bored ape worth about 33 ETH and he lists that he is accepting loan offers on it.

📍 Vitality Bootharon decides to offer 15 ETH to Merk for 7 days with 5% interest.

📍 Elton Mask ALSO decides to make an offer but that offer is for 20 ETH for 4 days with 8% interest.

📍 Merk decides to go with Elton's offer, Vitality Bootharon is devastated.

📍 Merk connects his wallet, accepts the offer, and sends his bored ape NFT to the Pawn My NFT Smart Contract

📍 Elton also connects his wallet, accepts the offer and sends the 20 ETH loan to the Pawn My NFT Smart Contract

📍 The Smart Contract delivers the 20 ETH loan to Merk Quebarn

📍 The Smart Contract uses the force and generates an NFT for both users that acts as proof of transaction.

📍 After the agreed upon 4 days, two things can happen.

📍 If Merk pays back the 20 ETH loan plus 8% before the grace period ends, his bored ape NFT gets released from the Pawn My NFT Smart Contract and goes back to his wallet and the 20 ETH + 8% interest repayment goes to Elton's wallet.

📍 If Merk cannot pay back the loan, the Smart Contract will unlock his bored ape NFT and Elton will be allowed to claim it after the grace period ends.

**👉 Tell me some of the important dates on the roadmap to check the progress of the project**

**🚨**12-03-2021 - ETH-Bridge - allows Multi-Chain Purchases of $PNFT Tokens

**👉 What is PawnMyNFT project all about?**

This is a revolutionary new project launched on BSC. It uses a platform and smart contract to support lending on Non-Fungible Tokens. PawnMyNFT will let you put any Ethereum NFT up for collateralization.

Other users can offer you a loan on that NFT. If you accept a loan, the funds get paid out from the -Lender's- account to you, and your NFT gets locked in a smart contract. Once you repay the loan, the NFT will be transferred back to your wallet. If you DON'T pay back the total repayment amount before the due date, the asset will be forfeited and transferred to the 'Lender'.

📍 for example Merk Quebarn has a bored ape worth about 33 ETH and he lists that he is accepting loan offers on it.

📍 Vitality Bootharon decides to offer 15 ETH to Merk for 7 days with 5% interest.

📍 Elton Mask ALSO decides to make an offer but that offer is for 20 ETH for 4 days with 8% interest.

📍 Merk decides to go with Elton's offer, Vitality Bootharon is devastated.

📍 Merk connects his wallet, accepts the offer, and sends his bored ape NFT to the Pawn My NFT Smart Contract

📍 Elton also connects his wallet, accepts the offer and sends the 20 ETH loan to the Pawn My NFT Smart Contract

📍 The Smart Contract delivers the 20 ETH loan to Merk Quebarn

📍 The Smart Contract uses the force and generates an NFT for both users that acts as proof of transaction.

📍 After the agreed upon 4 days, two things can happen.

📍 If Merk pays back the 20 ETH loan plus 8% before the grace period ends, his bored ape NFT gets released from the Pawn My NFT Smart Contract and goes back to his wallet and the 20 ETH + 8% interest repayment goes to Elton's wallet.

📍 If Merk cannot pay back the loan, the Smart Contract will unlock his bored ape NFT and Elton will be allowed to claim it after the grace period ends.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,👅 SeXRP ($SEXRP) 💦 - Presale Happening Now! - Say Goodbye to OnlyFans! - Watch & Browse to Earn! - How Long Can You Last?,"With the death of OnlyFans on its way, the hottest token to ever drop on the Binance Smart Chain has finally dropped. You can earn passive $XRP rewards by viewing and interacting with adult entertainers. With passive XRP rewards, you'll always have sloppy seconds to reinvest. Unlike Porn Hub, SexRP pays you to watch the stuff you like. How long do you believe you'll be able to keep going? Don't bust too soon!

&#x200B;

SexRP promises big celebrity ambassadors and adult entertainment. Participants in the first NSFW NFT drop will be limited to the first 1,000 token holders. Who wouldn't want one of those in their possession?

&#x200B;

What is SeXRP's significance? You may earn cryptocurrency simply by surfing and watching. Collect the sexiest NFTs from your favorite adult artists. The most enticing collaborations in crypto are right here with SeXRP. Their liquidity is also locked in for a long time, and we've introduced a pull-out mechanism that doubles the tax fees on every sale for individuals who have a lousy pull-out game.

&#x200B;

❤️ Features of SeXRP ❤️

\- browse to earn

\- sexy NFTs

\- sexiest collaborations in crypto

\- liquidity locked long and hard

\- earn XRP from simply holding

\- higher fees on selling (pulling out)

&#x200B;

We want to promote long-term holding and positive vibes in the Voice Chat that has consistent activity! Hold with us, chat with us, promote a non-scam on the BSC Network, and make money, sounds like a great deal!

The voice chat remains opened throughout most points of the day, with the developer dropping jokes, giving life advice, rapping, singing, and helping dispel any Fear Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD)! A dedicated team has been put in place, to monitor the chat, organize raids, design stickers, organize marketing, and design our website. The developer is committed to seeing this project reach new All-Time Highs, committing to spending everything possible in the marketing wallet! With XRPPancake, you know you have a reliable dev/admin team behind you! Did I mention that two of the admins have already doxed themselves live on video? Check out the pinned messages to see!

The SHIB migration is about to begin. To the iso20022 global standard of blockchains, the XRP Ledger.

**What is this blockchain – XRP Ledger? Tell me more about it!**

The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a decentralized, public blockchain led by a global developer community. Simply put, it is fast, energy efficient, and reliable. With ease of development, low transaction costs, and a knowledgeable community, it provides developers with a strong open-source foundation for executing on the most demanding projects – without hurting the environment.

The comparisons speak for themselves – XRPL has some of the lowest transaction costs out there – as low as 0.00001 XRP per transaction. Assuming an average price of XRP of $1USD, this is the equivalent of $0.00001 each time a transaction is executed. Compared to transaction fees on Ethereum, which can balloon to hundreds of dollars, and one quickly sees the economic benefits of using XRPL. Throughput is much higher as well, with the blockchain being able to handle upwards of 1,500 transactions per second, with an average speed of 3-5 seconds per transaction – on par with Visa, the global financial services corporation.

**What is XR Shiba Inu all about? What is their mission?**

First, they want to bring crypto to the masses, and do it in a way that not only benefits humans, but also benefits our furry pets who keep many of us company throughout our lives. Second, they recognize that, up to now, there remains a large gap in understanding what cryptocurrencies are, and what they can become. XRshib wants to help bridge this gap, and do so in a meaningful, socially responsible, environmentally friendly, and best of all, in fun way!

**What about the team’s vision?**

The vision of XRshib is to provide the opportunity for all of us to be able to easily and seamlessly use crypto in our daily lives. They want our communities to not only support each other in the use of XRshib, but also our animal friends who have so far seen very little benefit from the rising adoption of blockchain technologies. We look forward to a world where, through XRshib, we are able to play a role in the achievement of significant crypto adoption. In parallel, by leveraging the gains generated by the community, we envision helping and saving countless animals so that they can eventually find their way out of shelters and into good homes.

**What are the core features of XR Shiba Inu?**

Zero Gas Fees – As low as 0.00001 XRP per transaction. This is equivalent of 0.00001! each time a transaction is executed

3 Second Transactions – Blazing fast with an average speed of 3 seconds per transaction; on par with Visa, the global financial services corporation.

Energy Efficient – XR Shiba Inu uses .0008% of the energy in relation to Bitcoin and 0.00018% of the energy of Etherium.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,"Cryptocurrency Arbitration: Cardano and XRP on Exchanges possible guys! Really useful information for trading
","Cryptocurrency arbitrage is one of the most attractive strategies for traders looking for ways to make money on the difference in asset prices on various trading exchanges. In this article, we will look at the possibilities of arbitrage using two popular cryptocurrencies — Cardano (ADA) and XRP (Ripple), as well as key points that should be taken into account when conducting such transactions.  
  
What is arbitration?  
Arbitrage in cryptocurrency trading is the purchase of an asset on one exchange, where its price is lower, and subsequent sale on another exchange, where the price is higher. The price difference arises from differences in supply and demand across platforms. This creates short-term profit opportunities if traders are willing to react quickly to market changes. The topic of arbitrage is quite extensive and therefore you can watch my individual arbitrage trading method on my verified YouTube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXHnhvObw8E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXHnhvObw8E)  
  
Why choose Cardano and XRP?  
Cardano (ADA) and XRP are two large cryptocurrencies with a high level of liquidity and widespread use on a variety of exchanges, which makes them ideal for arbitrage strategies.  
  
Cardano (ADA) is a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications that has attracted attention with its thoughtful architecture and strong development team. ADA is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies with a large number of trading pairs on different exchanges, which creates frequent arbitrage opportunities.  
  
XRP (Ripple) is a digital currency designed for instant global payments with minimal fees. Thanks to ultra-fast transactions, XRP is an ideal candidate for arbitrage, as it allows you to quickly move funds between exchanges, minimizing time delays.  
  
The main types of arbitration  
Several types of strategies can be used in arbitrage using Cardano (ADA) and XRP coins:  
  
Inter-exchange arbitrage: a classic strategy in which you buy ADA or XRP on one exchange, where the price is lower, and sell on another, where the price is higher. This requires a quick transfer of assets between platforms and monitoring of several exchanges at the same time.  
  
Arbitrage within the same exchange: In some cases, there may be price differences between different trading pairs on the same exchange. For example, ADA may be undervalued relative to BTC, but overvalued relative to ETH on the same exchange. This opens up opportunities for arbitrage without the need to transfer assets to other platforms.  
  
Triangulation arbitration: This is a more complex strategy that uses multiple trading pairs. For example, you can start with XRP, exchange it for ADA, and then for another cryptocurrency (for example, BTC) if this chain makes a profit.  
  
Advantages and features of arbitration with ADA and XRP  
Using Cardano and XRP for arbitrage has a number of advantages:  
  
Fast transactions with XRP: One of the key problems of arbitrage is the time to transfer funds between exchanges. XRP, thanks to its high speed and low fees, allows you to minimize waiting time and respond quickly to market opportunities.  
  
ADA Liquidity: Cardano has wide coverage on most major exchanges, which creates many trading pairs with this coin. Due to this, traders have a better chance of finding arbitrage opportunities.  
  
Low fees: Both XRP and ADA have low transaction fees, which makes them advantageous for arbitrage transactions where even small price fluctuations can be profitable.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,"Cryptocurrency arbitrage: Dogecoin and XRP - a quick way to make money
","Cryptocurrency arbitrage is not just about buying and selling. This is a real quest with timing, speed and subtle strategy, especially when it comes to coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP. Let's figure out how to profit from the price difference between exchanges using these coins. In the video you can see more trading information about arbitrage trading and see the exact trading strategy with a profit of 15/17 percent   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlctLTnNhRM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlctLTnNhRM)

What is arbitration?  
Arbitrage is the purchase of an asset on one exchange, where its price is lower, and an immediate sale on another exchange, where the price is higher. The difference between these prices is your profit. The key is to act quickly before the market corrects this ""anomaly"".  
  
Why Dogecoin and XRP?  
Dogecoin — often fluctuates due to the hype in social networks, which causes significant price spikes on different exchanges.  
XRP is a popular cryptocurrency with high liquidity, which makes it ideal for arbitrage.  
Step-by-step arbitration process:  
Step 1: Find the price difference  
  
Register on several exchanges, for example, Binance, Kraken, KuCoin.  
Use price aggregators like CoinMarketCap or CryptoCompare to track current Doge and XRP quotes on different platforms.  
Comment: If you see that DOGE costs $0.064 on Kraken and $0.066 on Binance, then this is the perfect opportunity for arbitrage!  
  
Step 2: Buying Coins  
  
Once you have found a profitable discrepancy, buy DOGE or XRP on an exchange with a lower price.  
For example, you buy 1000 DOGE on Kraken for $0.064, which will cost $64 in total.  
Comment: Remember that cryptocurrency prices can change in seconds, so be prepared to act quickly.  
  
Step 3: Transfer and Sale  
  
Transfer your Dogecoins from the first exchange (Kraken) to the second (Binance) and sell them there at a price of $0.066. Now your income will be $66.  
Comment: Take into account the transfer and trading fees. For example, if the commissions are $1 per transaction, then the net profit will be $1.  
  
Step 4: Calculating the profit  
  
The difference in price — $2 ($66 - $64), minus $1 for commissions = net profit of $1.  
Useful tools for arbitration:  
Crypto Price Trackers: Help you track prices on multiple exchanges at the same time.  
Arbitrage Bots: Can be configured to automatically execute arbitrage trades.  
Risks:  
Delays in transfers: cryptocurrencies may ""hang"" on the network, and the price on the second exchange may change.  
Commissions: always check the commissions of the exchanges so as not to be at a loss.  
Conclusion:  
Arbitrage with Dogecoin and XRP is an effective strategy for those who want to make quick money from market fluctuations. But for successful arbitrage, you will need speed, accuracy and market knowledge.",274,2024-09-08 11:03:52,8

XRP can be sent directly without needing a central intermediary, making it a convenient instrument in bridging two different currencies quickly and efficiently.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,RippleGirl | Massive moonshot | XRP Rewards | Very low MC and massive marketing coming," As a Magical Girl, Ripple has long, dark brown hair that is put in a ponytail by a silver shuriken-like clip and brown-red eyes.During the events of the Unmarked, Ripple lost her left eye and arm. As a result, she now has a large scar over on the left side of her face and keeps her left eye closed at all times. Her outfit still remains the same though, due to the rules of becoming a Magical Girl.Deep down, Ripple also has a somewhat childish side, as shown when she made her Magical Girl character a ninja because she thought it looked ""cool"". However, she doesn't want anyone to know about this side of her and skillfully hides it. Her Specialty:

4-Dimensional XRP Bag: A magical bag. Not limited to objects, as living things can be packed into it, too. It's more of a bag rather than a pocket. Ripple took it after killing Calamity Mary.

RippleGirl is a newly launched token on the BSC. The aim of the token is pure fun and rewards. RippleGirl has a super low buy and sell tax of 8% of which 4% goes to XRP rewards and 4% goes to marketing. 40% of the supply has already been burned. All funds raised so far have been sent out to influencers, call groups and the best investors in the BSC. There are fun contests where the community wins BNB as well. It's an excellent hang with some excellet gains and a solid, based team.

The team has launched many legitimate tokens on the BSC with great Dapps, this is strictly a fun rewards play by the team. With super SAFU coding to make the investor secure in their investment. The team always delivers on their promises, feel free to stop by the telegram group to see the proof of how the marketing funds are used and everyone's huge bag of XRP rewards.

Why have a play that's just fun with no use case? Because we're all here to have a good time. Each one of these tokens is like its own little country with it's own curreny and we want you to belong to our country. Come be a part of the RippleGirl community. We're brining the BSC back to what it once was community based rewards tokens, with straight forward tokenomics and a transparent team. Come make a suggestion and help the community to reach new heights never seen before in the BSC. The community is already super solid and enjoying the token.

Many low MC plays try to simply take their investors with crazy tokenomics that cost high transaction fees and high tax for buys and sells. It's hard to feel safe when you're paying a super high percentage in and out. This is simple and straight forward, without those crazy high transaction fees and solid XRP rewards.

Rewards tokens inherently cause red candles to sell tokens fo rth rewards. The developers have combatted this with innovative rewards functions that optimize both gas and selling pressure on the chart. Rewards are on a volume and holdeings based payout schedule. As usual a holder can interact with the contract in anyway to receive rewards as well. (buy/trade/sell)

What Marketing? Come join our VC where we discuss every marketing technique we us ein detail with many influencers right in the voice chat. Transparency is of the upmost importance to us. Prelaunch we had our graphics designer pop out some great jpegs and 25 animated stickers. THe plan is to make sure everyone sees LadyCat everywhere.

&#x200B;

The telegram group and contract address of the token will be dropped into his main launches group right at the launch, this is a measure to **avoid bots**: [https://t.me/MakkkStealthLaunches](https://t.me/MakkkStealthLaunches)

&#x200B;

Nothing complex and complicated, a BEP20 token with locked liquidity of **7 days** on mudra, link will be  provided at launch, in case it needs to be extended he will extend it for **another 7 days**.

&#x200B;

In case everything goes well then a marketing wallet will help to take it to another level and help with listing on exchanges, that's why he chose **7%** for marketing and project development.

&#x200B;

In order to maintain a **stable and quality liquidity pool** he chose to put a tax of **6%** that will go automatically to the liquidity ensuring a nice LP and a better chart.

&#x200B;

XRP is one of the best cryptocurrencies out there, that why he chose XRP as rewards.

Dev chose to use 7% for rewards, which is the best number to get good rewards and also to avoid big contract sell that can affect negatively the chart, also he's forking a **well written contract that doesn't paint the chart red**.

&#x200B;

He's also developing a gaming platform that will be used on the website which is currently not yet released, the game will allow its players to win XRP and DinoXRP.

&#x200B;

* There will be giveaways for shillers and raiders, before and after launch.

&#x200B;

There will be giveaways everyday, marketing wallet will be used non-stop, initial liquidity will be around 1 bnb so the first 100 holders will become whales very easily.",1035,2021-09-13 06:31:46,16

👉 **What is this blockchain – XRP Ledger? Tell me more about it!**

The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a decentralized, public blockchain led by a global developer community. Simply put, it is fast, energy efficient, and reliable. With ease of development, low transaction costs, and a knowledgeable community, it provides developers with a strong open-source foundation for executing on the most demanding projects – without hurting the environment.

The comparisons speak for themselves – XRPL has some of the lowest transaction costs out there – as low as 0.00001 XRP per transaction. Assuming an average price of XRP of $1USD, this is the equivalent of $0.00001 each time a transaction is executed. Compared to transaction fees on Ethereum, which can balloon to hundreds of dollars, and one quickly sees the economic benefits of using XRPL. Throughput is much higher as well, with the blockchain being able to handle upwards of 1,500 transactions per second, with an average speed of 3-5 seconds per transaction – on par with Visa, the global financial services corporation .

👉 **What is XR Shiba Inu all about? What is their mission?**

First, they want to bring crypto to the masses, and do it in a way that not only benefits humans, but also benefits our furry pets who keep many of us company throughout our lives. Second, they recognize that, up to now, there remains a large gap in understanding what cryptocurrencies are, and what they can become. XRshib wants to help bridge this gap, and do so in a meaningful, socially responsible, environmentally friendly, and best of all, in fun way!

👉 **What about the team’s vision?**

The vision of XRshib is to provide the opportunity for all of us to be able to easily and seamlessly use crypto in our daily lives. They want our communities to not only support each other in the use of XRshib, but also our animal friends who have so far seen very little benefit from the rising adoption of blockchain technologies. We look forward to a world where, through XRshib, we are able to play a role in the achievement of significant crypto adoption. In parallel, by leveraging the gains generated by the community, we envision helping and saving countless animals so that they can eventually find their way out of shelters and into good homes.

👉 **What are the core features of XR Shiba Inu?**

✅Zero Gas Fees – As low as 0.00001 XRP per transaction. This is equivalent of 0.00001! each time a transaction is executed

✅3 Second Transactions – Blazing fast with an average speed of 3 seconds per transaction; on par with Visa, the global financial services corporation.

✅Energy Efficient – XR Shiba Inu uses .0008% of the energy in relation to Bitcoin and 0.00018% of the energy of Etherium.

GoldenXRP is here to make a change in the standard of BSC projects, as it aims to lead cryptocurrency into a golden era and provide both, short and long term profits for all investors by revolutionizing reward base utility as well as shortening the gap between the community and the developer team through sheer transparent work and open communication. After all, it's for the benefit of both parties that the token succeeds. Fair launch took place yesterday and huge marketing is about to kick in. Future long-term plans include Golden NFTs and Golden Game Arcade. 

💸 Automatic XRP rewards airdropped hourly to all holders' wallets. No need to claim anything!

We will be exploring different possible use cases in this time period as well. We will be bringing in devs to help with future projects.

&#x200B;

🧬 During we will be focused on marketing, and partnerships. We will be exploring many different use cases for our token. We will start looking into ways to promote our token use. We will also be looking for more people to bring onto the team, i.e devs, graphics designers, marketers.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Xrp Classic Making Progress in Closed Beta Testing of Forward-Thinking Blockchain Classic Chain!,"  
We are here with exciting news! Working on the  
blockchain, Xrp Classic is nearing the end of their blockchain, which they call  
Classic Chain. Classic Chain is configured using the powerful and reliable  
Proof of Authority protocol. Xrp Classic is proud to share the results of  
closed beta tests and in this article we will give you some important  
information.  
**What is Proof of Authority?**  
Proof of Authority was proposed by Gavin Wood,  
one of the co-founders of Ethereum. In the Proof of Authority protocol, users  
who verify transaction blocks on the blockchain use their identities and  
reputations instead of using and staking cryptocurrency assets to validate transactions.  
In networks that use the Proof of Authority protocol, individuals with  
pre-verified identities gain the authority to produce new blocks. The real  
identities of the validators responsible for the functioning of the network are  
known, and their authorization comes after a certain review process following  
the disclosure of their true identity.  
**What is the Purpose of Using Proof of**  
**Authority Blockchain Networks?**  
Proof of Authority was developed as an  
alternative to commonly used protocols such as Proof of Stake and Proof of  
Work. It is used in blockchain networks with the aim of providing an  
alternative to the limitations and issues that need to be addressed in Proof of  
Stake and Proof of Work. The Proof of Authority protocol allows for a higher number  
of transactions per second compared to other protocols. The energy consumption  
in these transactions is significantly lower. In comparison to other protocols,  
lower transaction fees are incurred.  
**Tests on the Classic Chain TestNet Network:**  
**Nodes**  
   
The developer team has been conducting closed  
beta tests on the Classic Chain TestNet network for a long time, today we will  
share with you some results of these tests. In the closed TestNet network, the  
number of blocks currently created has exceeded 100,000. This is a testament to  
the strong and steady progress of the blockchain.  
**Fast and Efficient Block Creation and Transfer**  
**Time**  
The developer team has made and continues to  
make some updates to the methods of creating nodes as a result of long work to improve  
the performance of the blockchain. Thanks to these updates, it was possible to  
reduce the average block generation and transfer time from 6.5 seconds to 5.1  
seconds in low-intensity situations. These fast transaction times will enable  
users to perform transactions on the blockchain faster and more efficiently.  
   
**Transition Plans to Open Beta Tests**  
Closed Beta tests of Classic Chain continue  
unabated, and they stated that they will share other data and achievements they  
have achieved in the near future. After the Closed Beta tests are fully  
completed, they announced that they will start open beta tests.  
**Congratulations to Xrp Classic on their**  
**success!**

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,"DinoXRP just launched, on a dip right now but a reversal has already started! Don't miss it!","This is be the second launch of TheMAKKK, first one was called LargeDoge, it did 25x, he wasn't very prepared compared to this one, it launched 30 min ago, ATH was 11k, (55x from 200$ starting mcap), it's on a dip right now, with a reversal being started.

The main telegram of his launches is: [https://t.me/MakkkStealthLaunches](https://t.me/MakkkStealthLaunches)

The telegram of the newly launched token is: http://t.me/DinoXRP

Nothing complex and complicated, a BEP20 token with locked liquidity of **7 days** on mudra, link is pinned, in case it needs to be extended he will extend it for **another 7 days**.

In case everything goes well then a marketing wallet will help to take it to another level and help with listing on exchanges, that's why he chose **7%** for marketing and project development.

In order to maintain a **stable and quality liquidity pool** he chose to put a tax of **6%** that will go automatically to the liquidity ensuring a nice LP and a better chart.

Right now the rewards are DOGE (7%), but this can change with community votes.

Dev chose to use 7% for rewards, which is the best number to get good rewards and also to avoid big contract sell that can affect negatively the chart, also he's forking a **well written contract that doesn't paint the chart red**.

He's also developing a gaming platform that will be used on the website which is currently not yet released, the game will allow its players to win divident tokens chosen by the community.

* There will be giveaways for shillers and raiders, before and after launch.

Top BSC Marketers in MiniXRP 🗝🗄

&#x200B;

""After moon 🌚 the plan is for full maturation of the MiniXRP project. Receiving auto XRP for holding MiniXRP is only the initial foundation, we will be looking for new and innovative ways to develop further utility as the project progresses. Earning XRP as passive income was strategically chosen due to the stability and popularity of the coin, combined with the exposure XRP is receiving due to the ongoing lawsuit.

XRP is the native cryptocurrency for products developed by Ripple Labs. Its products are used for payment settlement, asset exchange, and remittance systems that work more like SWIFT, a service for international money and security transfers used by a network of banks and financial intermediaries.

Our plan is to impact both the crypto and non crypto sectors like no other token project has done before."" 🏁

Malicious projects in the Binance Smart Chain space have thrived because of alack of information with new investors in the space. By providing educational discussion regarding trading crypto, we change our investors lives by providing them with the tools that they need to avoid those tokens.

Baby XRP provide a safe BSC token to invest in, with liquidity locked in perpetuity(1), and rewards in the form of Legacy XRP.

Rather than providing reflections in native token, or a buy-back mechanism Baby XRP provides reward in Legacy XRP to reward holding the token and avoid investors being subject to the complexity of and impermanent loss seen when staking LP in farming apps.

Baby XRP also utilizes an automatic liquidity pool to replenish the liquidity of the token on every transaction. The contract will collect tokens from each transactions adding them to the LP, which creates stability for the token, supporting the price floor.

We use several mechanism to encourage holding the tokens, rather than using bots to manipulate price or attempting to pump and dump the token: The requirement to hold tokens for 3 days to get the XRP reward as well will encourage investors to hold.

The tax on each transaction as well is an encouragement to hold. Every transaction is taxed 17 %.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,🌕 GoldenXRP | Huge Fair Launch In About 24 Hours | Already 450 TG Members | Up to 15% XRP Rewards From Transactions | Pre-launch Audit Ongoing | Leading Cryptocurrency Into A Golden Era,"Let's face it, we've all had our fair share of losses in the BSC before, no matter how carefully you invest, you still have to go through a steep learning curve to be able to recognize value and legitimacy in projects. But even then, you may still lose money whether it's due to the dev's shadiness or sometimes simply because of missing the pump.

GoldenXRP is here to make a change in the standard of BSC projects, as it aims to lead cryptocurrency into a golden era and provide both, short and long term profits for all investors by revolutionizing reward base utility as well as shortening the gap between the community and the developer team through sheer transparent work and open communication. After all, it's for the benefit of both parties that the token succeeds. Fair launch is taking place tomorrow at 5 pm EST. Future long-term plans include Golden NFTs and Golden Game Arcade. 

💸 Automatic XRP rewards airdropped hourly to all holders' wallets. No need to claim anything! 

📝 Pre-launch audit ongoing by Nexus Solidity

🎯 A carefully prepared marketing plan is being implemented at the moment, one that aligns with the roadmap, to achieve the token's short and long term targets. 

⚙️ 15% tax on every buy that is redistributed in the following manner: 7% to holders, 2% to the liquidity pool and 6% to the marketing wallet. Moreover, holders will receive 15% in rewards from sell transactions due to the increased tax of 23% on sells.

🔒 Liquidity will be locked upon launch

More Details about What BabyXRP really is:

BabyXRP

Many malicious projects in the Binance Smart Chain space have thrived because of a lack of information for new investors in the space. By providing education and discussion regarding trading crypto, we change our investor’s lives by providing them with the tools they need to avoid those tokens.

Baby XRP provides a safe BSC token to invest in, with liquidity locked in perpetuity(1), and rewards in the form of Legacy XRP.

Rather than providing reflections in native token, or a buy-back mechanism, Baby XRP provides reward in Legacy XRP to reward holding the token and avoid investors being subject to the complexity of and impermanent loss seen when staking LP in farming apps.

Baby XRP also utilizes an automatic liquidity pool to replenish the liquidity of the token on every transaction. The contract will collect tokens from each transaction, adding them to the LP. This creates stability for the token and supports the price floor.

We use several mechanisms to encourage holding the tokens. We don’t use bots to manipulate price or attempt to pump and dump the token: The requirement to hold tokens for 3 days to get the XRP rewards will also encourage investors to hold.

The tax on each transaction is also an encouragement to hold. Every transaction is taxed 17 %.

(1) Liquidity is locked till 2099 using Dx.Lock.

[https://dxsale.app/app/v2\_9/dxlockview?id=326&add=0&type=lpdefi&chain=BSC](https://dxsale.app/app/v2_9/dxlockview?id=326&add=0&type=lpdefi&chain=BSC)

In addition we provide an inclusive community with 24 hour voice chat to educate our fellow investors on how to trade safely, grow their money, and make smart decisions when investing on the Binance Smart Chain.

The project uses a fully doxxed developer team, further instilling trust and safety for the investors.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Beyond XRP: Top Altcoins to Watch for the next Bull Run,"Even though XRP is often the favorite, apparently there are still many other altcoins that are predicted to shine brightly during the crypto bull run in 2024–2025. According to several leading analysts, there are at least five crypto assets besides XRP that are worth looking at to reap tempting returns in the next few years.

First, [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) Coin ($CRO) is considered to have brilliant prospects considering its role as a crypto utility token. A well-known analyst, as reported by Coinpedia, even invested a large portion in CRO by holding 264,000 coins on various platforms to exploit its potential to reach a price of $1–$3 per token.

Furthermore, [Morpheus.Network](http://Morpheus.Network) ($MNW) also stole attention thanks to its being a supply chain SaaS middleware platform. The project is at the forefront of revolutionizing supply chain management, offering innovative solutions that improve the transparency and efficiency of shipments from start to finish. Their masternodes can earn up to 18% annual percentage yield in rewards. The competitive return on investment highlights the project’s appeal not just for its technological advancements but also for its financial incentives.

Not to forget, Litecoin ($LTC), as a veteran altcoin, is still being considered based on its promising long-term potential. One top analyst is even said to be maintaining $7,000 worth of LTC in his portfolio in the hope that this pioneering crypto coin will soar again in the upcoming bull run.

Two other stars that are often mentioned are Solana ($SOL) and Avalanche ($AVAX). Both are considered prospective as long-term crypto investments, supported by compelling utility and growth opportunities.

Even though XRP may still be the main focus, the five altcoins above are worth considering to expand your portfolio, considering the great potential pinned by well-known crypto analysts. Of course, fundamental research and evaluation remain key before making any investment decisions.",1,2024-05-05 23:29:12,1

Is there anyone who wants to miss out on this space trip? 🚀

STELLARISE 🌌

StellaRise 🐼 is set for a presale on Wednesday 4th, with a full launch on PancakeSwap 24 hours after! Use StellaRise to ride the XLM rocket ship!

It's simple: StellaRise awards holders with XLM for free automatically every six hours. The more StellaRise you hold, the more XLM you get.

You can also claim XLM manually after buying - see details in the TG.

🌟 WHAT IS XLM? 🌟

Lumen (XLM) is the native cryptocurrency for Stellar, an open source blockchain payment system. The purpose of Stellar is to connect financial institutions via the blockchain and provide cheap transactions in developing markets. Jed McCaleb, the co-founder of Ripple (XRP), created Stellar in July of 2014.

XLM has a MC of $ 28.15B and average 24-hour volume of $ 575.06M.

XLM has been flying, soaring up 16% recently: https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/xlm-price-sprints-higher-as-rumors-of-stellar-acquiring-moneygram-surface-202107221900

XLM is doing well, so it makes it a great time to launch a token that will give you XLM automatically.

🌛 DIVIDEND INNOVATIONS 🌛

StellaRise does not use old anti-whale or anti-dump mechanics, it uses new tools to prevent contract dumping on the chart and ruining momentum. The devs often have AMAs in the TG to explain this in detail.

💰 TOKENOMICS 💰

Total Supply: 100,000,000,000

15% Taxes

7% Dividend

✨ HOW TO BUY ✨

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,"Nano Cheems XRP: The biggest little Cheems moonshot there is! 100% SAFU With a long term vision and plan for success, through Organic Growth and strategically timed marketing we plan to break free from the usual pump and dumps plaguing BSC in this market!","A safu low cap moonshot, Nano Cheems seeks to set itself apart from other similar low cap tokens out there starting by building a strong base community before doing heavy spending on marketing. We aim to start day 1 off slowly bringing new members in organically by word of mouth and free calls channel posts provided by friends in the community. The purpose of starting slow is to prevent a one day pump and dump that's been so common in the BSC space lately! We've seen it too many times, a new token launches and exhausts all their marketing options on day 1. Plus only relying on expensive calls early on brings in the wrong kind of crowd, the ones who will always ask ""wen marketing?"" and ""wen cmc?""

&#x200B;

Day 2 we get our website and socials online, start with paid calls from small to mid-sized channels and CMS trending done in a way that strategically keeps a steady stream of new investors into the project but not so many that the price pumps too high and dumps to the floor. The idea is to grow the project organically and bring in people that share our vision of bringing a fair launch low market cap token to a legitimate long term project, a true moonshot!

&#x200B;

Day 3 and beyond we will apply for all the listing websites, get bigger call channel posts, start trending on twitter and fully flesh out our litepaper and long term goals!

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,$JIZZXRP the hottest meme token on BSC rewarding holders in XRP. Very low mc super early,"The creation of JIZZXRP, the hottest meme token on the market today, started as a joke among a group of four friends who were all cryptocurrency enthusiasts. 

They were looking for a new and exciting project to work on together, and they thought it would be funny to create a token that rewarded holders with XRP, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market.


Initially, the team had no plans to launch the token publicly. They created it purely as a joke and for their own amusement. However, when they shared the idea with a few close friends in the crypto community, they were surprised by the enthusiastic response they received.


People were immediately drawn to the idea of a meme token that rewarded holders with XRP, and the team realized that they might be onto something. They decided to launch the token publicly and see what would happen.


To promote the token, the team started sharing borderline explicit memes on social media, particularly on Reddit and Twitter. The memes were designed to be humorous and irreverent, and they quickly caught the attention of the crypto community.


As more people started buying and holding JIZZXRP, the community grew even larger. People were attracted to the token not just for its potential value, but also for the sense of humor and camaraderie that the community had developed around it.


The team continued to promote the token with even more outrageous memes, and the community responded in kind. They were shilling JIZZXRP to the moon, and it was rapidly becoming one of the most talked-about meme tokens on the market.


Today, JIZZXRP has a large and active community of holders who are passionate about the token and its potential. While it may have started as a joke, it has become a genuine phenomenon in the world of cryptocurrency, thanks to the creativity and humor of its creators and the passionate support of its community.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,Coinbase Relists $XRP: 5 Cryptocurrencies That Deserve A Listing,"The partial victory of Ripple ($XRP) against SEC has taken the crypto world by storm. From a significant price rally to Coinbase relisting the digital payment network’s token, it has been an eventful week for Ripple. First $BTC reached the $30,000 mark, and now this. The market is ripe for more such development that could finally catalyze the beginning of a much-awaited bull market.  
  
Irrespective of what happens next, Coinbase relisting $XRP is a big move that could pave the way for the listing of more fundamentally-strong emerging projects. In this blog, I discuss 5 such tokens that Coinbase should consider listing.  
  
5 Tokens That Deserve To Be Listed on Coinbase  
  
1. $KDA (Kadena): $KDA is the native token of Kadena, a public blockchain network that aims to improve scalability with its enterprise-grade Layer 1 solution. It addressed two key issues that traditional blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum face — scalability and security. Kadena uses the altering “braided multi-chain mechanism” to offer improved scalability and enhanced security. With developers actively looking for alternatives to Ethereum, $KDA has a huge market opportunity in front of it.  
  
2. $FTM (Fantom): Fantom is a smart contract-powered blockchain powered by $FTM, which aims to establish itself as an alternative to the Ethereum network. Fantom facilitates faster and more cost-efficient transactions. Launched in 2019, Fantom is a direct threat to Layer 2 solutions like Solana that aims to somehow reduce the challenges that the Ethereum network faces. $FTM has also been a favorite of crypto investors since the previous bull run.  
  
3. $VET (VeChain): We have another Ethereum alternative on the list. Powered by $VET, VeChain is a leading enterprise-grade Layer 1 network that aims to fuel a sustainable and scalable blockchain ecosystem. The VeChain economy is powered by two tokens — $VET and $VTHO. Being a low-carbon blockchain gives $VET an edge over other Layer 1 solutions. It definitely deserves to be listed on leading exchanges like Coinbase.  
  
4. $MNW (Morpheus Network): $MNW is the native cryptocurrency of Morpheus.Network, a blockchain agnostic supply chain management solution with partner networks in 5 different continents, a global clientele. They have partnerships with enterprise clients like Gulftainer, Vitalcan, and Senasa. In the world of hype, $MNW shines as a utility-based project. If utility is what exchanges are chasing, $MNW surely deserves to be listed on top exchanges like Coinbase.  
  
5. $AGIS (SingularityNET): How can we complete this list without including a project that’s bound to make it big amidst the AI wave? Whether AI tools will eat up jobs is a question for the future. However, technology is bound to bring along much-needed disruptions. SingularityNet, powered by $AGIS, is a decentralized marketplace for AI algorithms. It is the first and only platform that allows AIs to cooperate and coordinate at scale. The platform allows users to effortlessly “build, share, and monetize” Artificial Intelligence services. SingularityNet brings along a combination of both hype and utility.  
  
Conclusion  
  
The recent relisting of $XRP on Coinbase has opened up possibilities for other fundamentally strong projects to be listed on the platform. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, it is essential for exchanges like Coinbase to consider adding tokens that offer unique solutions and have a promising future. Among the tokens that deserve a listing on Coinbase, we have highlighted five noteworthy projects. Kadena ($KDA) stands out with its focus on scalability and security, offering an attractive alternative to Ethereum. Fantom ($FTM) aims to provide faster and more cost-efficient transactions, posing a direct threat to Layer 2 solutions like Solana. VeChain ($VET) fuels a sustainable and scalable blockchain ecosystem and has the advantage of being a low-carbon blockchain solution.  
  
Morpheus Network ($MNW) shines as a utility-based project in the realm of supply chain management, boasting partnerships with enterprise clients worldwide. Finally, SingularityNET ($AGIS) is an exciting project in the AI space, offering a decentralized marketplace for AI algorithms.",0,2023-07-17 14:08:54,1

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,"New Token - BABYXRP has launched! This token rewards diamond hand holders in XRP every 7 days, this is already big and will only get bigger!","Welcome to Baby XRP

Baby XRP presale sold out in 10 seconds! I was linked into this in a chat in another group and after being in the telegram for a few moments, I realised, I want to be on this trip! 

The coin was wider released on pancake swap last night, I witnessed a flurry of buys waiting for some sells for a better entry point, I got my wish, now with the paper hands out the token looks to be making great progress, a new ATH by the end of today is certainly on the cards in my opinion. The current market cap is $553,360 with $170,517 locked in the liquidity pool. 

This is just the start, the devs are very ambitious and are working hard to market and push this token to 10 times what the current market cap is, maybe even 100, who knows, I really think this is a great entry point, and I really think this is a moonshot!

Let me tell you more about the token

There is 

A 2% Burn

Baby XRP is a deflationary coin, meaning that as time goes on the total supply will reduce. 2% of every transaction will be sent to a dead wallet being burned from the total supply forever, increasing the value of the remaining tokens

5% to Marketing

Baby XRP is here to stay! 5% of every transaction will be sent to the marketing wallet, to be spent on future marketing and advertising, to ensure that we will continue to attract new investors and holders.

5% to Liquidity

5% of every transaction will be sent directly to the liquidity of the coin itself, This ensures that the Liquidity keeps a healthy ratio in comparison with every holder and Marketplace.

5% Ripple effect - this is the new shit!

To be eligible, starting 2 hours after the launch you need to hold for 7 days. 

Every 7 days all DIAMOND hand holders will get an equal amount of XRP airdropped to their wallet.

Interested? I though so!

XRPige is an open source, peer-to-peer digital asset, on the BSC, favored by people that love passive income worldwide.  


About us  


XRPige was built when the team recognized the BSC community as respectable and professional, but lacking somewhat in one thing; HYPE. XRPige is designed to bring the hype and fun of a meme coin together with XRP, to the BSC. The team set out to create a new token in a market that was totally foreign to them. Quickly learning and meeting new connections, XRPige was born. It is designed to be the next Shiba like coin but with XRP Rewards, in the BSC. XRPige birth took place after Crogecoin, we have so much love for the Pige Inu and SafeMoon community that we decided to give our holders back. The XRP market is 'expected' to 200x over the next years. It currently sits at a $0.38 price point, with experts preaching near $80 in the near future. So logically speaking, as the BSC and XRP market goes up, XRPige will grow parallel with the rest of the market. With an early birth and easily acquiring a large market share being the first successful meme to utility token, we saw no reason why XRPige wouldn't be able to reach it's full potential. Enjoy your passive XRP income by just holding!

**What are Tokenized Stocks?**

Tokenized stocks are tokenized derivatives that represent traditional securities, particularly shares in publicly listed companies traded on regulated exchanges such as Scotts Miracle-Gro, Curaleaf, Aurora, Apple, Tesla and others.

The key benefits of tokenized stocks include fractional ownership of traditional securities, 24/7 access to markets, and greater liquidity to name a few. These digital assets are backed 1:1 by traditional stocks, entitling holders to the same economic benefits of owning the underlying stock.

RastaSwap has been developed to be the #1 AMM Decentralized Exchange for Tokenized Cannabis stocks, and a bridge between the traditional stock market and crypto market, making it easier to invest in cannabis stocks and assets placed in different countries at the same time from anywhere in the world.

**What is Decentralized Exchange (DEX)?**

A decentralized exchange (or DEX) is a peer-to-peer marketplace where transactions occur directly between crypto traders. DEXs fulfill one of crypto’s core possibilities: fostering financial transactions that aren’t officiated by banks, while brokers running on blockchain with public registry of operations, handle all interactions automatically through Smart Contracts. There are Many popular DEXs, like PancakeSwap, Uniswap and Sushiswap.

**What is AMM?**

AMMs systems took off after they were first implemented by Shearson Lehman Brothers and ATD in the early 1990s.

In crypto, AMM is being used for the most important existing decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap and it allows digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way, by using liquidity pools rather than a traditional market of buyers and sellers. Prices are determined by a constant mathematical formula.

Liquidity pools can be optimized for different purposes and are proving to be an important instrument in the DeFi ecosystem

RastaSwap it’s a AMM Decentralized Exchange community owned, which means that all liquidity pools are managed and owned by the community sharing the profit from all transactions on the exchange.

**Passive Income**

RastaSwap is a community owned and driven project. All Profit-sharing from all liquidity pools and transactions fees on the exchange are distributed to RastaCoin ($RCOIN) holders, everyday at 4:20 PM in form of $ETH, $BNB or $CAKE automatically deposited to your wallet . The tech behind this project will be managing the pools and farms so users can sit back, relax, and receive their profits automatically deposited in their Wallet.

**A Secure Platform to Trade and Launch 4:20 Friendly Tokens**

Our goal is to create a platform where any cannabis initiative can receive funds with RastaSwap. This can include startup projects or already established cannabis businesses. They will be able to issue tokens backed in real stocks or assets.

**RastaCoin - $RCOIN Token Details**

$RCOIN is the governance token of the RastaSwap project and it's mandatory to participate on voting and funding. When a new token is offered on market, having $RCOIN will be necessary in order to participate and the $RCOIN used will be burned to reduce the token supply.

**Ticker:** $RCOIN

**Token Specification:** BEP-20 / ERC-20

**Max Supply:** 160,000,000 $RCOIN

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,$MAYO | Next $PNUT | CMG & CMC listed,"$MAYO | Next $PNUT | CMG & CMC listed

Mr. Mayonnaise $MAYO was living the good life chasing string, and being a little champion. Then one day, out of nowhere, a tick decided to ruin everything. What should have been a simple nuisance turned CATastrophic, landing Mayo in the ICU with a vet bill so high it could fund Jeff Bezos yacht for the day.  

The fight isn’t over yet, and Mayo needs all the help he can get. To cover his skyrocketing medical costs, we stand for all the absurdly expensive pets we love. This isn’t just about one cat, it’s about showing we can rally around our furry friends when it matters most. 

We’re on a mission to make sure Mr. Mayonnaise gets the care he needs without turning into another tragedy. No one needs another $PNUT disaster on their hands! 

Spread $MAYO, save Mayo, and let’s keep this kitty kicking. Together, we can make a difference and give this little champion the chance to chase string again.

Is my math right). So $10,000 invested on 12/1/2015 at $0.00415 would be $7,218,916 roughly? Is my math correct? $10,000 to $7 million in 2 years?

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,✖️🥞 XRPPancake! | Huge Reversal | from 3K MC to 100k MC and Growing | First Pancake and XRP Reflector | 5% Rewards in each paid hourly | 2 Doxxed Admin Live on Voice Chat | Marketing Wallet Spent Based on Community Decisions | Experienced Team | 100x Incoming!🥞✖️,"You thought a little red line would keep us down? Think again, XRPPancake is still here and is stronger than ever!

Lots of the Pump and Dumpers are out, consolidating nicely around 65k (the previous consolidation was 30k), and so much still planned! Things like; influencer tweets (CryptoCharizard), AMAs with various whale groups on telegram, a Twitter meme competition, oh and another CMS post!

People have shared their amazing reflections and have reinvested their reflections into this project! If you’re one of the few diamond holders since we launched, you’ve probably gotten at least 6.0 CAKE and over 100 XRP. That’s about $220 USD in reflections alone for a near-max wallet.

XRPPancake is already approved SAFU by the StaySAFU team, as one of its first advertisements was getting banner ads on the StaySAFU scanner bot. This automatically means that XRPPancake is an approved SAFU token. On top of this, 2 of the admin/devs have already doxed live on camera, and one has promised to dox if we hit 1,000,000 MC.

The solidity developer is still in voice chat for almost 18 hours a day, still rapping, singing, and talking to the community about how we can continue to push this forward. It is a community token in the sense that the community’s input is imperative to its success. Moderators are constantly watching the chat to dispel all Fear Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD)! The team is still dedicated to making sure this project reaches new All-Time Highs, constantly spending the money in the marketing wallet. With XRPPancake, you know you have a reliable dev/admin team behind you! 

Here is a little refresher on our tokenomics:

Are you curious about the XRPPancake Tokenomics? Here you go:

* Supply: 100,000,000,000**🚚**
* Decimals: 18**🧮**
* Max Wallet: 2,000,000,000**💰**

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,🚨 #InfinitX - Rebase + Rewards 🚨- Unique tokenomics | 6% rewards in $XRP | FAIR Launching on 19TH Oct AT 4PM UTC," **Welcome to #InfinitX  🦍** 

*THE FIRST $XRP REBASE & REWARD TOKEN !*

**$INX is a token deployed on the Binance Smart Chain which combines a rebase function and dividend rewards.**

**By simply holding $INX you receive 6% in $XRP rewards, automatically sent to your wallet.**

**NFTs and Play2earn videogame & much more to come soon.**

 

***For those who don’t know this is how a rebase functions works:***  
*Let’s say you bought 100 tokens, each for 1$. You paid 100$ and got 100$s worth. After the rebase, the supply is cut in half but everything else remains the same.*

*So now you have 50 tokens but each is worth 2$. So you still have 100$, but split among 50 tokens instead of 100$. However as more people buy and the price goes up the value of your coins go up and the chart always looks beautiful.*

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,XRP Apes is getting bigger by the day. In works with partnerships with 2 other successful rewards tokens.,"
XRP Apes is now listed on CoinGecko

Before you read any further, some quick take always.

7% rewards in XRP just for holding. Not like the 5% rewards token where you need to hold for 3 days and if you sell, you’re disqualified. Nope, every hour (during times of higher volume), but if it isn’t every hour, the rewards still accumulate. VC is open almost 24/7. Most lit chat in all of BSC. CMC listing is imminent. Audited by tech rate. Creating an alliance. Join the TG to find out more.

XRP Apes 7% automatic XRP rewards. Launched Friday morning (US time)

🦧Welcome to XRP APES 🦍🦧

7% automatic XRP rewards every 60 minutes (with higher volume). During times of lesser volume, rewards will compound and be sent once threshold is met.

XRP APES is the all-encompassing crypto ecosystem that brings swap, XRP rewards, AND anti-whale mechanisms together to deliver you comfortably to the moon! 🚀 🌝

XRP Apes is changing the game with 7% automatic XRP rewards.

Why is our coin so big? 3 letters, 1 coin. ❗️❗️X R P❗️❗️ We all know where XRP will be in a few years. XRP is easily a top 3 coin if it weren’t for the US judicial system. Once Ripple wins, there is no where to go but up. ⬆️

We have run ads and will run more ads on poocoins, have been trending on coinsniper, will be listed on CMC, and Trust Wallet. We have been tweeted by Crypto Messiah, Fabri Crypto, have been on Satoshi Bets, and many many others. We have had several yourubers reach out to us and crypto cowboy did a review live on his show.

Voice chats almost 24/7. Come and talk about anything. We don’t care.

Have you heard of Everrise and Tiki, well XRP APES is combining both elements and more.

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,BabyBabyXRP is mooning and cashing out free XRP for everyone! It just stealth launched and is 100% safe! Check it out!,"Welcome to BabyBabyXRP - Just stealth launched - Free XRP for holding

BabyBabyXRP uses a revolutionary reward system, divorcing rewards from the taxes collected!

With BabyBabyXRP, 97% of the taxes collected get burned, increasing the value for all holders.

Rewards are paid out at a MUCH higher percentage than standard rewards contracts (20% vs 10%).

This is possible by withholding 30% of the total supply in the contract, and using those tokens for the regular swaps rather than tokens collected through tax!

Together with the rewards, there will also be tax for liquidity generation and marketing to ensure that the long-term goals will be met and every BBXRP HODLer will be happy.

BabyBabyXRP also boasts a global team with utmost confidence. The team has a lot of different expertise that can help the community and the token itself.

BabyBabyXRP tokenomics:

Contract address: 0x8e553a394c28afdfd3cc5851d4816a2c42a83ffc

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000
Buying Tax: 10%
Selling Tax: 20%
Max sell: 0.5%
Max Wallet: 2%

No max buy

IMPORTANT INFORMATION:

There is a 5-minute cooldown between sells to avoid huge dumps and to keep the chart healthy.

Do you find yourself in constant frustration, beating yourself up about being too late and missing out on the last x1000 token you came across? Do not make that same mistake yet again! Here is a great opportunity to get in very early into a promising project with huge potential..

At MicroXRP we are determined to make trading and crypto as much fun and as interesting as possible! Our unique tokenomics are a fork of the original micro machines contract but we’ve modified them to be a little more user friendly!

Watch your token soar into the hundreds of dollars range!

&#x200B;

So get involved now with our new token MicroXRP where you turn your crypto into more crypto 😉 MicroXRP is a great way to spend your day trading and holding, we have tons of volatility (which is what everyone wants!) and a great community on telegram.

&#x200B;

💥 Tokenomics will be split with 10% Tax:

&#x200B;

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,🐵 BNBApes - Stealth Launch - Very low marketcap - If u miss xrp apes this is the one for you easy 10000x from here," Recently I stumbled upon this project a few days ago and was wondering why no one is investing on it. Since I joined I've been a part of their Telegram group and its such a fun and lively community of APES! This is seriously a very undervalued project. Let me explain to you why!

I've had a hard time deciding to investing due to all scam coins and rug-pulls. I can't willingly put my money somewhere it could be taken away from me by some ill mannered people.

This is why BNBAPES is such a relief, because it is a decentralized protocol and there is no owner or team. There are volunteers in the community putting crazy hours on this, I think they don't even sleep ( LOL! ) to build out the project and the community.

This is the safest place I've ever seen because there was no ownership on the contract. Ever! This was made possible through a unique launch method where the contract was sent some BNB and then after that a community member launched it. It wasn't launched by the contract creator!

BNBAPES, ($BNBAPES) is an outsourcing service done the Defi way. With crypto integrated, we allow for anonymity and faster transactions than ever to get your most essential projects complete. Find creatives, managers, and more on our platform both new and experts in their field. Together with our tokenomics, holders will benefit by receiving BNB whenever a transaction takes place, meaning that every time a service is paid for, you get a small cut as well

Please just check it out you don't want to miss this opportunity. I promise you won't regret it!

Great features:

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000

90% tokens burned

LP burned

5% fee to liquidity pool

2% fee distributed to holders

15% reflection

12% reflection of XRP to your wallet!

Arigato Gozaimasu!

XRP,CryptoMoonShots,XRP - huge upside opportunity,"Not investment advice and also not stocks so feel free to get rid of this post if it’s against the rules but I’ve been monitoring a situation I think people in this sub might be interested in.

3 years ago - ripple coin (xrp) was the 3rd largest crypto coin behind Bitcoin and ethereum until the SEC slapped them with a lawsuit causing the price to tank, and for exchanges (coinbase, etc) to delist. Prior to the lawsuit - analysts noted - and still do - the very strong utility of ripple - nearly instant and nearly free transactions.

The sec’s law suit hinges on the belief that XRP is a security unlike bitcoin + ethereum. 

Fast forward to today and after a few months of hearings it’s trending extremely well for XRP, in my opinion - it is trending to a decision where if XRP is a security, so is Bitcoin + ethereum - which would have huge market implications and I believe the judge won’t want to touch that.

A few days ago, xrp lawyers won the right to see the Bitcoin and ethereum initial analysis from the SEC causing the price to 4x in a week. The SEC did not want these documents shown as it may force the judge to see that the 3 cryptos are similar - whether they’re all securities or none of them.

Given a small hearing win took the price up 4x, there is insane potential here. The upcoming events that could occur to moon xrp r exchanges relist and eventually ripple wins the case .

Even if ripple loses the case - in the short term there will only be gains. Do some research and let me know what y’all think",10,2021-04-10 16:03:07,6

What is eRipple? eRipple(EXRP) is a tokenized version of Ripple on the Ethereum blockchain. We believe Ripple is a great project and has tremendous value. The main issue , however is with the excessive number of tokens that are in circulation and the high total supply. With the kind of community Ripple has it should be worth more than $1 but its struggling to do so. This is not the best for a cryptocurrency investor looking to make ROI on his investments. We solve that problem by limiting the supply and giving token holders the best of both the Ripple technology and the Ethereum Network.

XRP,Altcoin,"""Cheap"" coins are not as cheap as they seem","We've just added feature to our comparison tool. You can compare coins by their levels of supply (either total or circulating). We normalise the price of the coin by removing unit bias. This feature gives you a good view of the coins that look ""cheap"" but are probably not as cheap as they seem.

E.g: We assume that XRP had the same circulating supply as BTC, and use the formula (XRP Supply / BTC supply * XRP Price) to remove unit bias. Under these conditions, XRP price would be $ 2,913. Matching by total supply, XRP price = $ 6,023

It's definitely not as cheap as it seemed. See more at: http://matchcoins.info/?c2=ripple&c1=bitcoin

I hope you'll find it useful. Any feedback is very welcome.",226,2018-01-23 14:14:03,85

XRP,Altcoin,Wanna battle other holders with your nft pokemon? Introducing THE CHARIZARD TOKEN,"Imagine an ecosystem of multiple Pokemon NFTs, on a platform we call the ""Social Hub"". You'll be able to talk to other trainers, trade, open Pokeballs containing random Pokemon NFTs, auction your Pokemons and ultimately battle other trainers. All on our NFT Marketplace/Social Hub, how exciting is that?!

These Pokeballs will be bought using the Charizard Token (CHZ006), all transactions made on the Social Hub will be made using CHZ006. Each transaction made using CHZ006 will burn 2% and redistribute 3% to all holders. This will result in an incentive to spread the use of CHZ006 as much as possible.

Already listed on Coinmarketcap and the Delta app, price tracking on CMC does not work yet, CMC is working on it and should be fixed soon.

The 3 Founder Charizard NFTs which are the first NFTs have been sold for:200K CHZ006 ($36K), 160K CHZ006 ($28.8K), and 150K CHZ006 ($27K), go Check it out:[https://charizardtoken.com/nft.php](https://charizardtoken.com/nft.php)

XRP,Altcoin,ALVA -- a top Crypto with James pick (1st mover for basket-token-standard),"1.

2. Which tokens do they offer? Their website says ""Thousands of tokens to choose

Taking our tokens straight from Uniswap, you have access to an unlimited amount of tokens.""

They show icons of Chainlink, Solana, Avalanche, Monero, Matic, Ripple (?).

In the whitepaper: ""Through an integration with Wormhole (https://wormhole.com/) or a similar cross-chain solution, assets from any blockchain will be able to be included in any ERC-7621 minted on

Alvara’s protocol.""  I see on Uniswap: Chainlink, Solana (wormhole),  Avalanche (wormhole), Matic. But not Ripple nor Monero on Uniswap. So,  it looks like they will try to offer all tokens, but a lot of them will  be wrapped or wormholed

XRP,Altcoin,Post 2: The Top Cryptocurrencies to Own in December UPDATED Dec 19th,"Post 2 is officially outdated, Post 3 can be found here: https://redd.it/7l032g
Feel Free to Follow me on Reddit for daily recommendations, on IG: JaketheCryptoKing, and Twitter: JBtheCryptoKing

Post 2: The Top Cryptocurrencies to Own in December(19th) with Reasons

Hopefully some of the 3k views resulted in some buys as each of my picks were up over 15% yesterday (when Bitcoin had a 1% change). The goal of trading Altcoins is to beat the return of BTC, LTC, and ETH. The lazy American investment strategy, buying and holding on Coinbase, can be easily beaten with a little technique.


Yesterday’s Picks Were: EMC2, BAT, LTC, PAY, WAVES, NXT, XLM, MCO


Today’s Picks (ordered by date and bullishness): LTC**(Director speaking at 5pm), BAT*(founder speaking tomorrow AM PST), MCO (December 24th news), NXT (Airdrop), WAVES (NG activation and Airdrop)


Today’s Picks for CB: Ripple, Dash, Augur, Monero, NEO


Bonus: Check EMC2 at 3pm, 2 MIND BLOWING announcements according to their twitter.

LTC: One of the 3 directors of the Litecoin Foundation is livestreaming on Youtube at 5pm tonight. If you didn’t know about Litecoin before, you will after today. Litecoin directors have spoken 2x in the past. The first time LTC exploded from $90 to $170 the second time from $150-$300+. Today is the third time. History will repeat itself, expect to see LTC hovering between $420 and $500 by midnight tonight.

BAT: The founder speaks tomorrow morning. When the founders of coins speak regarding the coin there is significant news coverage leading to exposure and an increase in demand as new money tries to find the next BTC. I’m not promising BAT will be the next BTC, but it should continue to see significant gains through today, tomorrow, and tomorrow evening.

MCO: There have been multiple posts building hype surrounding the 24th as a date to set in your calendar. They plan on releasing 3 announcements the day before Christmas when everyone is home able to purchase MCO. Regardless of what the 3 announcements will be there will be a significant price climb for the next week in MCO leading up to the news. The news is expected to include new exchange listings and partnerships! This is great news, and the hype will be even more significant when the whole country (and a portion of the world) is at home on the 24th.

NXT & WAVES: Both have an airdrop coming up in the end of December. The logic is pretty standard for both coins. As the airdrop approaches most people move their coins from exchanges to their desktop based wallet to take advantage of the coins arriving in the airdrop. Both coin’s futures are trading at $2.00+. Therefore, there will be significant returns for those holding their coins in a wallet outside of the exchange at the time of airdrop. This will create a perfect storm for both coins in the end of December. There will be no coins left on the exchanges in preparation for the airdrop, yet demand will be highest in the 2 days leading up to the airdrop. When demand is highest and supply is lowest (on the exchanges), price climbs greatly, Economics 101.

Coinbase has promised to add multiple coins in the 1Q of 2018 (likely January). When CB announces which coins will be added, the price of the specific coins will increase 100% at least. The day it is added to the CB exchange (if you can call it that), lazy Americans will have exposure to their 4th coin, likely at the lowest price in comparison to LTC, BTC, and ETH. Most have no idea what market cap is etc, so there will inevitably be a surge in price as incompetent investors flock to the newly listed coin (which was only available for years on other exchanges). My predictions for which coins will be added to CB are: NEO, Monero, Augur, Ripple, and Dash. If Ripple is added I believe it will have the most rapid price climb because many won’t understand why it’s priced at 80cents (even though the market cap has it already competing with ETH and beating LTC). Dash is used regularly in Europe, NEO in Asia, Monero on the dark web, and Augur has an in with CB and is presenting at very important events in January. Coinbase is likely to pick two or three to not seem like they are choosing favorites and I fully expect Ripple and one or two others to be selected. 

THESE ARE SOLELY STRATEGIES YOU CAN USE IN THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKETS BY NO MEANS AM I TRYING TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVICE. I DO OWN SOME OF THE LISTED CURRENCIES FOR THE REASONS I’VE STATED.

XRP,Altcoin,Did XRP just bottom against Bitcoin?,"This [Cointelegraph article](https://cointelegraph.com/news/did-xrp-price-just-bottom-against-bitcoin) is making a case for an XRP bottom against BTC. As far as I am concerned, the charts make complete sense but I would also like to hear your thoughts on this. 


Could this be an actual XRP bottom?

XRP,Altcoin,"Be careful: Coinbase wallet stops support for XRP, ETC, XLM and BCH","Those that still have their mentioned assets on Coinbase, you better withdraw it immediately because they'll be stopping the support for these by January 2023 as per Coinbase's article but on Coindesk, it says December 5. Although from their website says that it won't be lost but it's better to have it on your own posession before anything else. 

And the main reason why they're going to stop supporting these coins is networks due to low usage.

JakeIstheCryptoKing (reddit, Instagram, and Twitter: JBTheCryptoKing) asked if I'd submit this for him because Altcoin was removing it instantly for some reason? This is NOT my post but his and because he's been so cordial to correspond with I decided to post it for him! Follow him below. Anyone know why I can post it but he can't?! He's made great posts this week...)

Yesterday and last night were fun ones! Depending on what time you checked your portfolio it may have been up 10% or down 30%. I personally think there was significant manipulation holding the crypto market down as a whole yesterday, while it prepares for the rally from Christmas Eve – End of January (conferences planned every weekend across the globe). I posted days ago predicting XRP would be added to CB as my favorite pick and was significantly disappointed when BCC was chosen over it. However, CB promised multiple currencies in Q1 of 2018 so XRP I believe is still a candidate (XMR too). The market agrees with me hence the 100% increase in the last 48hrs. I am still recommending buying and holding XRP, even at the $1.00 price point (my original recommendation came when it was under $.5). The price spiked to over $1.40 yesterday and this type of volatility can make you wealthy on 30% day trade margins, or 100% buy and holds. XRP is one of the few currencies that functions well with banks, is being tested by multiple banks in Japan and by Mastercard with positive news from all thus far. Buy and hold.

NXT dropped slightly with the market yesterday even though their airdrop was supported by Bittrex and is valued at approx. $1.40 per coin. The airdrop is valued at more than the underlying coin currently meaning NXT will have to appreciate to a minimum of $1.40, likely $2.00+ with news that Poloniex or another exchange is also supporting the airdrop. We have a week before the airdrop and I expect extreme appreciation of most altcoin prices over the holidays. NXT should be trading at a minimum value of the airdrop $1.40- $3.00 (upper limit). I hope everyone picked up some NXT at $.90 last night (trading at $1.10 right now)!

MCO still has me and many other anxiously awaiting the news they’ve promised to release on the 24th. I expect it to continue to produce gains of 10-15% leading up to the 24th with a likely pop leading up to the announcements and a significant climb if the surprise announcement is positive! (on Christmas eve how could it not?).

PAY and BAY have Christmas surprises coming and both are near completion of many of their projects. What could the surprise be? The suspense alone should be enough to drive the prices up 20% minimum in the next 3 days.

WAVES has their NG activation today (supposedly) stay tuned for that as it should increase the price per coin leading into the airdrop and Binance contest listed below. The NG activation greatly increases the speed in which transactions take place (a key factor of coin functionality, why XRP is so successful right now).

BINANCE CONTESTS EXPLAINED: WAVES, TNB, TRX Binance is holding 3 contests, 2 based on trading volume and 1 based on accumulation. All 3 games/promotions will drive significant trading volume of their underlying coins, in turn driving the value of the specific coins higher for the next 3-10 days depending on the specific promotion. I think this is an ingenious way for Binance to get new traders involved while holding free promotions!

WAVES’s promotion is based on how much you buy and accumulate (sales and withdrawals are counted against you). With an airdrop coming at the end of the month and NG activation in 36 hours I expect the next 4 days to see significant upward trending price movement (prediction: 10% per day).

TRX and TNB’s promotion is based on total trading volume with the leaders approaching 1000BTC, but there are still plenty of prizes for smaller traders (sharing 4million TRX or 2million TNB for example). The sheer demand to exchange huge volumes to get more entries creates a game like atmosphere increasing the price for the next 4 days (only 4 days left in the promotion). I expect to see a nice price jump the next 48hrs. Not to mention it is down 40% from today’s highs to still be slightly up overall today (good time to get in).

I think owning either of the three (not to play the game) but as a buy hold strategy for the 3 days while many individuals play the game is a must! If you enjoy day trading it these three are having 15-30% swings daily and you can take part in the game!

THESE ARE SOLELY STRATEGIES I USE IN THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKETS BY NO MEANS AM I TRYING TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVICE. I DO OWN SOME OF THE LISTED CURRENCIES FOR THE REASONS I’VE STATED.",10,2017-12-22 17:37:38,29

XRP,Altcoin,#RelistXRP,"#Repost @cryptowzrd
・・・
At present time, XRP was up around 10% and trading at $0.52, as called by Billy.

The supposed cause for this seems to have been yesterday’s discovery hearing in the SEC vs. Ripple case, which produced two “surprise bombshells” in favor of Ripple, as analyzed by Jeremy Hogan. As a result, there is now a new hope among XRP investors that crypto exchanges could relist XRP – before a final ruling from the Court of the Southern District of New York in the lawsuit between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple.

An SEC lawyer stated in the hearing, which was about the SEC’s motion to receive Brad Garlinghouse’s and Chris Larsen’s personal financial records, that “only Ripple and affiliates of Ripple” could have sold XRP illegally.

Jeremy Hogan analyzed that this is important because exchanges that delisted XRP two months ago did not violate securities laws and would not do so if they re-listed XRP and started selling it again. The attorney also speculated that “a slew of non-action letter request coming or already received by the SEC”.

John E. Deaton, who re-filed to intervene in the Ripple v. SEC case on behalf of more than 10,000 investors, wrote via Twitter that this turn of events confirms his Writ of Mandamus. Deaton said:

In our Writ of Mandamus I made a bold statement when I said: ‘It is legally incorrect, intellectually dishonest and completely disingenuous for any SEC lawyer to stand up in open court and claim that all XRPs are securities. If the SEC attempted to make that argument, it would be laughable, if the economic damage that has been done wasn’t so tragic.’

The hope for the re-listing of XRP for American users is currently raising high expectations. Numerous community members expect an immediate rise in the price of XRP as soon as the first news leaks out that exchanges are listing XRP again – similar to the well-known “Coinbase effect”, only bigger.",4,2021-03-24 00:10:45,2

XRP,Altcoin,XRP market cap and why it won't rocket,"When I first started looking into crypto I was mesmerised by ripple......wow a crypto that is targeting the banks! I mean if this catches on the holy fuck right, this could be worth shitloads.....

Then I dug further and learned more about crypto. Now I hold exactly zero XRP, here's why.....

The supply is ridiculously high. If the market cap of XRP meets the same market cap as BTC, which is currently some distance away, then each XRP token will be worth slightly less than $6 each. Compared to BTC's $14k, even if XRP hits the same market cap as gold it will only be worth $200 where BTC would be worth nearly $500k.

If you wanna make shitloads with ripple you're going to need to 1) buy a shit load, I mean a good few thousand of these. 2) be patient because it's going nowhere fast. 3) have nerves of steal because it could drop back down to the 25c mark and stay there for a while again 4) get lucky because there's a chance the tech may not even catch on and adoption could fail

XRP,Altcoin,A DOGE’s Mediocre Rise,"🚀 DOGE to the Moon! Market Cap Hits $42 Billion as Price Soars to $0.30 📈✨

By Bitlender, Investigative Blogger/Technical Analyst 📊

Dogecoin (DOGE) has taken the crypto world by storm once again! With a 92% price surge in a week, this meme coin has soared past $0.30, becoming the 6th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, beating XRP and USDC! Let’s dig into what’s driving this rally and where DOGE might go next. 🚀🐕💥

Key Stats and Market Momentum 📊🔥

	1.	Market Cap: $42.3 billion, ranking 6th in crypto.
	2.	Price Surge: Over 90%, pushing DOGE above $0.30 📈.
	3.	Trading Volume: Up 220%, hitting $16.8 billion daily.
	4.	Liquidations: $64M liquidated, with $36M in shorts closed 💸.

DOGE’s rally aligns with a broader crypto surge and recent optimism following Trump’s election win. Meme coins like SHIB and PEPE also gained this week, adding fuel to the DOGE hype! 🐕‍🦺💥

Technical Analysis 🔍: Support & Resistance 📉📈

	•	Support: $0.2800 and $0.2614 – Crucial levels if DOGE retraces 📉.
	•	Resistance: $0.3000 and $0.3034 – Breaking above could push further gains 🎯.

DOGE’s recent climb through $0.220 resistance, reaching a high of $0.3034, shows bullish strength, with consolidation hinting that buyers are still engaged.

Volume and Indicators 🔄💹

A Rising Wedge Pattern hints at potential moves; the MACD stays bullish, and the RSI above 50 shows steady buying interest. DOGE holds above its 100-hour SMA, suggesting market support for potential breakouts. 📊🚦

Fibonacci Extensions: 🚀 $3.95 to $23.26? 🤯💰

Based on Fibonacci levels, DOGE could aim for $3.95 or even $23.26 if current support holds strong.

Conclusion: 🚀 To the Moon or Breather? 🌕🐕

DOGE’s rally reflects renewed interest in meme coins, with indicators showing potential for $0.32. But beware, meme coins swing wildly!

XRP,Altcoin,"What altcoins would you invest $ 1,000,000 in?","Hi everyone!  
We are all partly investors, we are trying to find the token that will bring us good x2x5x10... We will scatter our several thousand in different places with the hope of a good income. Feel free to manage your deposit, take into account risk management, etc.  
But the situation is interesting, imagine that things are going well and at one point your deposit is $ 1,000,000.  
What would you do and how would you behave? What altcoins would he invest in? Perhaps you would keep in stable positions while waiting for a great situation to enter the market?  
What altcoin / altcoins would you choose and what would you invest your million in?

XRP,Altcoin,What's In Your Bag,"AltCoin preferences all depend on how you see the world of crypto evolving. I used to only be into SOL (bought at $8, held at $250, still holding - I'm a long term investor; despite their recent growing pains, there's still massive adoption and I fully believe will get back with upcoming updates) but have branched out to diversify holdings with how I see the future being built in web3. What are some of your other AltCoins and what's their elevator pitch?

My others are XRP, Polkadot, and WeGro. 

XRP 
[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/]
There's no doubt in my mind a favorable decision is coming. Despite being in litigation with the SEC, it continues to trade heavily in outside exchanges and holds a steady T10 market cap. When the decision comes, I see an absolute explosion despite the current state of the market. 

Polkadot [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/] 
DOT connects and secures specialized blockchains to facilitate cross-chain transfer of any data or asset type. This allows blockchains to be interoperable with one another to provide a foundation for web3. 

WeGro
[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wegro-coin/]
WeGro is only 7 months old and setting itself up for BIG things. It's all about decentralized participation im the CAM industry (complimentary alternative medicine). But my biggest takeaway with them is their ability to create an ecosystem of privitizing your data to sell yourself to marketing companies. Instead of big companies selling your data, you take the power back and decide what to do with it. It's some eye-opening stuff at a ground level. Their 10 min video (https://youtu.be/I9AsmCUVBok) will widen your eyes at the future of data in web3. 

[Disclaimer - I'm a social moderator for WeGro as an independent contractor but this IS NOT an advertisement. I actually believe like hell in this AltCoin and am far off from being a MoonBoi]",16,2022-06-15 23:18:29,113

XRP,Altcoin,"""Cheap"" coins are not as cheap as they seem","We've just added feature to our comparison tool. You can compare coins by their levels of supply (either total or circulating). We normalise the price of the coin by removing unit bias. This feature gives you a good view of the coins that look ""cheap"" but are probably not as cheap as they seem.

E.g: We assume that XRP had the same circulating supply as BTC, and use the formula (XRP Supply / BTC supply * XRP Price) to remove unit bias. Under these conditions, XRP price would be $ 2,913. Matching by total supply, XRP price = $ 6,023

It's definitely not as cheap as it seemed. See more at: http://matchcoins.info/?c2=ripple&c1=bitcoin

XRP,Altcoin,Pitquidity: Passive income King returning 50% of profits to holders from Node/LP/Staking and more,"   
Make Passive Income so you won't have to grovel to a boss again. It is just one component to being financially free, and is what [Pitquidity.io](https://pitquidity.io/) offers. We have been live for a few months now and are now letting the world know what we have built behind the scenes in our new marketing phase starting now!

Most cryptos are projects where investors put their money into a coin and hope the price goes up. That is the sole dimension most investors look at. We have built [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) to be the best passive income crypto on the market today with our exclusive assets. [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) has project tokens on both ETH and BSC chains that are low tax reflection tokens that reward you in either ETH or BNB for holding $PITQD. All [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) tokens have or will have a very low tax as we encourage volume, and having PITQD as a trading token is another aspect to it's functionality.

Here is the best part!! [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) runs various nodes and manages various staking pools amongst other passive income activities and shares 50% of the weekly profits with token holders each weekend. With the other half of the profits, [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) takes and reinvests into node/staking to grow the asset base. Some of the hallmark assets owned are 5 Gala nodes, 15 instance Energi node, Almost 20k Songbird delegation tokens, Mysterium network and Presearch node operations plus more on ETH, BSC, Solana, Songbird and Polygon networks. All positions can be viewed and tracked on the [Pitquidity Financial Page](https://www.pitquidity.io/financials).

The freeing part is once your position is large enough in PITQD, the ETH and BNB it generates for you will allow you to break free from centralized exchanges like Coinbase to buy ETH or another exchange to buy BNB, as they are deposited in your wallet automatically.

There is also another side of the project called [Hardwood](https://www.pitquidity.io/hardwood) that is a trading floor with various trading tokens that will never be rug pulled.

Some of the tokens reflect back XRP, ADA USD and [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/) is adding more tokens regularly. [Hardwood](https://www.pitquidity.io/hardwood)

There is a lot more to the project, and this is just a general overview. but follow the twitter, FB, Reddit etc., and get in the Telegram group for more info on how it works. They all can be found at the bottom of the homepage here: [Pitquidity](https://www.pitquidity.io/)

XRP,Altcoin,Po.et (POE) - A sleeping giant?,"Hey guys, what do you think about Po.et coin? They have a really solid project and team (check out their website: https://po.et)
POE coin looks poised to explode when more people know about them, they don't do any hyping or marketing for their project, they are just letting their work speak for itself. I've been accumulating POE the past few days because I believe in their project and their team.

Edit: After doing some continued I would like to add that I believe POE is the kind of coin with such strong utility that in the future demand to use POE for creative asset licensing will drive the price very high.

Btw check out the video on their website https://po.et 
it's less than 2 minutes long and gives you a great overview of the project

Of course I need to add the most common advice that should be followed when investing: Don't put more in then you can afford to lose.
Having said that, I highly doubt you are going to lose :)

12/29 Edit:
Wow did you see the gains on POE today? Wowaweeewa

12/30 Edit:
Another big jump for POE, it is now in the TOP 100. This is a project that deserves top 100 status.

If you would like to send me a small tip, my ETH address is: 0x77eaa4B843d79cE883F56a36e9EeB4fA5cf38493

XRP,Altcoin,I built an arbitrage tool that tells you which exchange to buy from and which to sell with a built in alert system,"It took me about 6 months of coding to get where I am now, as of now it is able to find arbitrage opportunities between **Binance**, **Bittrex**, **Cryptopia**, **Bitfinex**, **YoBit**, **HitBTC**, **Kraken** and **Poloniex** with many more to come. 

It is not like the average arbitrage bots you see mine works by calculating the profit you will make buying on one exchange and selling it on another. It is able to detect which exchanges are doing maintenance on wallets so you don't waste time with false arbitrage opps. The best feature is our alert system that checks exchanges every 5 minutes for arbitrage opps and emails our subscribers as they happen. 

What led me to create it was I kept seeing huge price differences when I was daytrading last year some of the ones I was able to find was a 20% arbitrage opp on Metal and I was able to make 15% by purchasing it on Bittrex and selling it on Binance. It took me about 7 minutes transfer time. I was also able to buy Bitcoin Gold from Binance at least 3 times and transfer it to Bittrex and sell it for a 15- 20% profit each time which took me around 30 minutes. Something else I'd like to mention is that our alert system found the 40% arbitrage opp on BTC-VIA that happened when Binance was hacked a few days ago https://s.nimbus.everhelper.me/share/1533355/bs7dvuubgf83hmgpcnog and notified our susbscribers.  So the system works it's a matter of being online at the right time to capitalize of these arbitrage opps that are always occurring. 

My system is designed to eliminate trading risk by keeping your money out of the market as much as possible. The purpose is to detect when there is a large price gap between exchanges and capitalize off of it which means get in and get out as fast a you can. The only risk becomes the time it takes to transfer from one exchange to another but the ERC20 tokens transfer pretty fast so it works well with most digital currencies. Also have to be aware of the volume in relation to how much you money you trade with.

I would like to see how many people were able to successfully profit from arbitrage also who would be interested in such a system. 

Here is an image of how the system displays the arbitrage opps https://ibb.co/iBWafx and the system can be accessed at [Arbiswap.com](http://arbiswap.com)

XRP,Altcoin,"Has Flare, FLR got the potential to become the ultimate Cross-Chain DeFi Solution?"," Those who participated in the airdrop of this project just like APTOS when it was initiated exactly a year ago must be smiling rn. Tho, I joined a month later, I've got a sizeable amount of the airdrop. The project itself comes with a DeFi solution that has the potential to drive adoption being the first EVM Layer 1 blockchain to establish full interoperability of blockchains. 

Btw, after listing on several exchanges including Bitrue and MEXC earlier, the race has been more of ""how to deposit the over 4.27B airdrops"" to start trading tho only 15% of the airdrop is available atm. I did try to deposit on Bitrue before listing to no avail, then a friend suggested I try MEXC which worked just perfectly. And with that, a lot of liquidity has been provided there too. Having seen a lot of DeFi projects over the years, I'm a bit confident about the success of Flare with its combo of two L1 networks striving to enable info and data be used securely and at scale from various chains. So, it combines the rare qualities of security and scalability with convenience. Personally, I think DeFi projects have the ability to drive the market. My exploits with QNT is already an ""eye-opener"" cos most are solution providers with extensive utility just like Flare.

So, with the buzz and the robust utility of **FLR**, do you think it's time to look deeper into the project or not?

XRP,Altcoin,Buy and Hold 100 Cryptocurrencies for 5 years - Week 5 - $2553 gained,"It’s the 5th week since the experiment has started and a lot has been happening, I actually wonder to know if during the 5 years of the experiment there is going to be a quiet week.
The crypto world has been bombarded by FUD, first with China banning the miners, then with South Korean ban on the exchanges, all this caused the price of Bitcoin (BTC) to go as low as $13,105.90 USD. As if it wasn’t enough, Warren Buffet said that “Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies will come to a bad end”. All these caused also the altcoins price to go on a rollercoaster, but today seems like most of them are bouncing back.
To go into details about the experiment, the overall gain is $2533 USD (253%) or 0.19 BTC.
Only 10 Cryptocurrencies are in minus since the beginning of the experiment and 3 of them have reached a gain of over 1000 %.
Let’s talk about our Top5 cryptocurrencies.
Tron (TRX) is also for this week the best gainer. Five weeks ago I bought 2500 TRX with $10.04.  2500 TRX are worth now $275.48, a gain of 2644.83 %
Justin Sun, founder of Tron. Announced this week a new cooperation with Bao Feng, and been teasing about a cooperation with an innovative space company.
Verge (XVG) finally released to so waited Wraith protocol. The price has been stable and 1 XVG is now worth $0.15 , I first bought it 5 weeks ago at $0.0079.
Vechain (VEN) is the first new entry on the Top5,  looking at the chart it has been rising for over one month. In fact, when I bought it 5 weeks ago, I got with $10.11 , 18 (VEN), at the time the price was of $ 0.56 , right now the price is $6.24, so the 18 VEN is now worth $112.48 a major gain of 1012.14 %.
The other new entry on the Top5, sitting at the 4th position is Binance Coin (BNB), it’s been a while since BNB has been performing well, not sure about the exact reason, but it could be connected by the fact that Binance volume keeps growing massively. BNB can be used as trading fee option on Binance, doing so it lowers the trading fees from 0.1 % to 0.05%.
Binace volume has been that high that they could barely keep up and had to halt a few time the sign up of new users. From a recent tweet, they announced that they got over 5 Million users!
Ripple (XRP) is having again a big momentum, yesterday MoneyGram signed a deal with them announcing that it will use it to speed up their transitions. I believe this is one of the biggest wins for Ripple so far.
Top 5 cryptocurrencies so far :
Tron (TRX)  +2644.83 % , from $10.04 to $275.48
Verge (XVG)  +1794.52 % , from $9.62 to $182.25
VeChain (VEN) +1012.14 % , from 10.11  to $112.48
Binance Coin (BNB) +914.17 % , from $9.99 to $99.48
Ripple (XRP)  +837.01 % , from $9.75 to $91.34

XRP,Altcoin,"December 23rd Topics: Technology Driven Week with Christmas Surprises (XVG**, XEM*, STRAT*, ARDOR*, NXT*, MCO, PAY, BAY, WAVES, TRX)","(POSTING FOR JAKEtheCRYPTOKING,  Follow on Reddit and Instagram: JaketheCryptoKing or Twitter: JBtheCryptoKIng, he asked me to post as it wasn't working for him and look at his call on NXT this week!)

December 23rd Topics: Technology Driven Week with Christmas Surprises (XVG*, XEM, STRAT, ARDOR, NXT*, MCO, PAY, BAY)

NXT (will be in each post until the airdrop, went from $.9 yesterday when recommended to $1.70ish today), with the future value of airdrop priced this should trend toward $1.85.-$2.50. As I’m writing this I see it’s spiked over $1.60. That is almost 100% gains in 72 hours, I’ve been screaming to buy NXT in all of my prior posts. Today it popped, it should continue to trend toward $2.00. I just did the math on the IGNIS airdrop, the IGNIS has increased to $4.02 in value, meaning NXT should be worth a minimum of $2.00, a penny more for every penny NXT is worth following the airdrop, price point $2.00-$3.00 depending on if IGNIS continues to appreciates or not.

Technology: Nothing really creates 100% gains (or more) in the Crypto Markets better than technological block chain advances. This is the week’s leaders for this category…

XVG, VERGE WRAITH PROTCOL (XRG promises this to come out by end of year, plus a cool ad came out 4 days ago so I doubt they miss their deadline) anonymity with the flick of a button (public and private ledges in one block chain). XRG has promise WRAITH will be released by the end of this year, it should hit $1 when it does, McAfee although I don’t agree w/him on much he says, states $15 within 6 months of Wraith Protocol being released should be expected. I’m saying $1.00 it’s currently $.15 that’s a 600% upswing if I’m right, 6000% if McAfee is. Does it matter really who is at that point? Wrath allows the individual user to determine if they want they balance visible on the block chian or not. Right now we have coins like Monero which are completely anonymous hence their use on the dark web, or ones that are completely public where anyone who knows your wallet address can check your balance. XRG lets each user determine, public or private, this will revolutionize blockchian and altcoins.

XEM Catapult, which is version 2.0 of NEM (is to be released by the end of the year). Plus a 4 week hackathon beggning in January. There is nothing better to build awareness and test out their new Catapult network they’ll be releasing this week, then a worldwide hackathon and a new update to their NEM network.

STRAT, is going to have an amazing week. They promised that by January, ""I can confirm they will be able to host ICO's on our blockchain agnostic platform this year."" STRAT is on the cusp of being able to host ICO’s for other companies. This is extremely valuable technology and they’ve announced it will be ready to go this week. There should be anticipation, and extreme price growth once the tech is released.

ARDR, Platform launches Jan 1. Ardor’s blockchain becomes fully operational Jan 1st. Genesis snapshot announced 1 week in advance. Not to mention all those NXT you’ve been holding for the free IGNIS are used specifically on the ARDR block chain.

TRX: Promotion, Source code released on the 29th, open source platform. TRX has a promotion on Binance which drives significant trading. It is also in the Tech section because following the promotion I was expecting a drop in price, however, TRX has has their source code release on the 29th so even if there is a 1 or 2 day dip, it should explode upward on the 28th/29th.

CB Future Picks (same screenshot that showed BCC showed XRP and Monero). CB admits new coins will be added in the next few months. It was speculated in the online community that because CB released wallets for BCC, XRP, and Monero that those would be added next. CB adamantly denies that they planned to add BCC, XRP, and Monero. And then CB added BCC. I fully expect XRP and Monero to be added within 2 months, and that the original rumor they denied had some truth to it. XRP and Monero are buy and holds.

News this Week: MCO, has promised 3 surprises and a Christmas bonus. According to MCO, ""We have something special planned for all of you for December 25th and we think you will love it."" Their news cards are supposed to be released soon, maybe their debit cards (allowing you to exchange crypto for FIAT instantly) are ready! Check them out online they look GORGEOUS.

PAY & BAY (News and Surprises), Both have promised news on the 25th and given its Christmas I expect the announcements to be spectacular ones. Both have deadlines approaching for projects and I expect the announcements to either be completed projects ahead of deadlines or exciting new partnerships.

Binance Promo: TRX (real value in their code update on the 29th), price should dip after game concludes and then skyrocket after code update. TNB (garbage until Jan 11th) WAVES (different style promo, that gives entries based on accumulated WAVES).

Binance is holding 3 contests, 2 based on trading volume and 1 based on accumulation. All 3 games/promotions will drive significant trading volume of their underlying coins, in turn driving the value of the specific coins higher for the next 3-10 days depending on the specific promotion. I think this is an ingenious way for Binance to get new traders involved while holding free promotions!

WAVES’s promotion is based on how much you buy and accumulate (sales and withdrawals are counted against you). With an airdrop coming at the end of the month and NG activation yesterday I expect the next 4 days to see significant upward trending price movement (prediction: 10% per day).

TRX and TNB’s promotion is based on total trading volume with the leaders approaching 1000BTC, but there are still plenty of prizes for smaller traders (sharing 4million TRX or 2million TNB for example). The sheer demand to exchange huge volumes to get more entries creates a game like atmosphere increasing the price for the next 4 days (only 4 days left in the promotion). I expect to see a nice price jump the next 48hrs. Not to mention it is down 40% from today’s highs to still be slightly up overall today (good time to get in).

I think owning either of the three (not to play the game) but as a buy hold strategy for the 3 days while many individuals play the game is a must! If you enjoy day trading it these three are having 15-30% swings daily and you can take part in the game!

THESE ARE SOLELY STRATEGIES I USE IN THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKETS BY NO MEANS AM I TRYING TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVICE. I DO OWN SOME OF THE LISTED CURRENCIES FOR THE REASONS I’VE STATED.",24,2017-12-23 15:08:37,46
XRP,Altcoin,"If you had $350 to invest with, which altcoins would you get?","I have that much I'm willing to use for altcoins at the moment. I currently have TRX, STR, XRP, MIOTA, EOS, and XRB (in order from most to least). Due to money issues, I had to sell what little bitcoin I had but still doubled my profits. Obviously, I would like to be able to retire after holding lol but as long as I get enough profits for 1 BTC and a nice amount of fiat, I'll be a happy camper. I plan to put what I can onto my ledger that I purchased with btc, and put the rest into wallets and forget about them for awhile.

XRP,Altcoin,Discover the next big gainer: coin comparison MatchCoins.info,"To check the potential of a coin, i.e. how big it can get, I stack it against a similar yet more established coin, taking into account different market caps. To automate the process, me and my buddies have created this tool http://matchcoins.info/

It gives you a good indicator for the potential of the coin or if you will, a starting point for making any further assumptions.

How to use it: 1) On the left, select the base currency (the more established one) 2) On the right, select the coin that you‘re interested in 3) See the potential price of the second coin if it reached the market cap of the first one

E.g. ETH on the left, ICX on the right. The price of ICX if it‘s market cap reaches ETH‘s market cap would be $279.25, 31.91x times the current price. At 75% of ETH‘s market cap, ICX = $139.62

I hope you'll find it useful. Any feedback is very welcome",82,2018-01-19 14:16:50,25

We have been live for a few months now and are now letting the world know what we have built behind the scenes in our new marketing phase starting now!

**Most cryptos are projects where investors put their money into a coin and hope the price goes up. That is the sole dimension most investors look at. We have built** [**Pitquidity**](https://www.pitquidity.io/) **to be the best passive income crypto on the market today with our exclusive assets.** [**Pitquidity**](https://www.pitquidity.io/) **has project tokens on both ETH and BSC chains that are low tax reflection tokens that reward you in either ETH or BNB for holding $PITQD. All** [**Pitquidity**](https://www.pitquidity.io/) **tokens have or will have a very low tax as we encourage volume, and having PITQD as a trading token is another aspect to it's functionality.**

**Here is the best part!!** [**Pitquidity**](https://www.pitquidity.io/) **runs various nodes and manages various staking pools amongst other passive income activities and shares 50% of the weekly profits with token holders each weekend. With the other half of the profits,** [**Pitquidity**](https://www.pitquidity.io/) **takes and reinvests into node/staking to grow the asset base. Some of the hallmark assets owned are 5 Gala nodes, 15 instance Energi node, Almost 20k Songbird delegation tokens, Mysterium network and Presearch node operations plus more on ETH, BSC, Solana, Songbird and Polygon networks.

**There is also another side of the project called** [**Hardwood**](https://www.pitquidity.io/hardwood) **that is a trading floor with various trading tokens that will never be rug pulled.**

XLM -solid partners, blue collar XRP
IOTA -interesting concept 
BAT-marketing token
STRAT-good team
XVG -a silly hold IMO (Monero is king?)
EOS- fomo fomo fomo
XRP- sketch, solid returns tho 
TRX -fomo got to me, seems overvalued
SUB - come on, why not?
QSP - personal favorite
ICX -been killing it lately on returns 
FUN- a long shot gamble, ironic right?
STRAT- solid team, okay partners
VIB- bought on a whim, website screams marketing scam. I fell for the pretty website lol
LTC -served me incredibly well, but then Charlie Lee loves fud his brainchild. Get off twitter CL. 

Regrets (missed the boat):
LSK - scoped it out at $2, $6, & $8. Then I got busy with school and never pulled the trig. What a rookie!

XRP,Altcoin,A Paradigm Shift; how can we use it? (Charity Tokens and Sustainable/Ethical Cryptocurrencies),"I believe we're a part of a paradigm shift occurring globally and am posting this because I want your ideas, I want to learn about new projects that are doing good and making positive changes to peoples lives and the environment, and that you will share what you've learned along the way.

***What is the paradigm shift?***

We're moving to decentralized technology. The shift aims to remove a central authority and create immunity to government interference or manipulation. Currently, this is fueled by cryptocurrencies such as BTC, Eth, etc shifting the store of value from FIAT, ultimately, allowing these cryptocurrency communities to become the decision-maker.

...so my question is if we're becoming the decision-makers; how do we leverage the capital inflows to change people's lives for the better and help mitigate the impact and risks of climate change?

***What I've learned?***

**1) Why there is so much capital flowing into assets and increasing the price of cryptocurrency:** The world has seen governments ramp up quantitative easing measures across most major countries globally. For example, the U.S with $1.9T, which has resulted in significant capital flowing through the systems; reserve banks buy bonds from gov (which means the government borrows money from the Reserve Bank), who use the borrowed money (bond) and spend it on citizens (stimulus packages, COVID relief, etc), this goes into the hands of citizens.. Governments also buy company bonds (lend companies money) that invest this money into new investments, products, services, or goods to create GDP or simply, pay their staff, etc - which means more people get hired and have money and invest...interest rates are also very low, which means companies (and people) can borrow easily. In layman's terms, a lot of people globally now have discretionary funds to invest, which is why most asset classes (including Crypto) are seeing all-time highs.

**2) Mining is energy-intensive and often bad for the environment**.. with some studies claiming the electricity needed to mine bitcoin is more than used by 'entire countries'.

**3) There has been a recent rise in self-generating liquidity tokens** that redistribute transaction fees to holders to 'moon which seems to be focused mostly on wealth creation - but what about governance, charities/the environment?

**Summary:**

With so much capital inflows into Cryptocurrencies, a major paradigm shift occurring globally to decentralized ways of living we should be starting to think about how can we use this momentum to do better, right?

\> LOOKING FOR PROJECTS FOCUSED ON ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, CHARITIES & ETHICAL WORK <

When doing some research, I found one that looks legit and some information about coins that don't consume much energy, would appreciate input or feedback:

***Charity Tokens (here is an awesome one I recently found!):*** [***https://www.milktoken.net/***](https://www.milktoken.net/)

**1) Milk and Butter Token (charity token)** that has already raised $25k (which is awesome given they only have a \~$1m market cap) with Food for Life Charity Global (which has projects occupying over 60 countries and volunteers who provide up to 2,000,000 free meals daily!). 

Looks like the token gathers fees on every Butter transaction and the holders of the Butter token can then use their tokens to cast their vote on which charity should receive the next donation.. Tokens are also deflationary so it looks like holders will be rewarded over time.

**2) Sustainable Coins based on Kilowatt hour (KWh) consumed per transaction**

XRP does 0.0079

Dogecoin 0.12

Cardano 0.5479

If anyone knows of any coins offsetting their energy usage or any awesome charity tokens you guys have found please let me know!",49,2021-05-04 23:39:26,8
XRP,Altcoin,Anyone have any good feelings about a specific Altcoin?,"I have already invested in a few altcoins. Some I’ve bought are cpc, eos, tnb, and med token. I was wondering, does anyone have any altcoins they recommend I check out or any they have a good feeling about the futures of. If you could also say why, that would be great. I’m hoping to learn more about some others with promising futures that I can decided whether I want to invest in or not. Thanks! ",12,2018-04-04 04:09:40,30
XRP,Altcoin,"Evening Updates for December 20th - NXT, WAVES, BCC, MCO","Evening Update for December 20th- NXT, WAVES, BCC, MCO
For Daily Updates Follow on Redditt, IG: JaketheCryptoKing, & Twitter: JBtheCryptoKing Picks for Today Were: BCC, NXT, WAVES, MCO, & BAT

Evening Updates for the 20th:
(My prior post for the 20th was removed because I included a referral link for individuals to join Binance for the airdrop, I guess reddit did not approve. However, a copy of the post, and referral link,  can be found on my personal page to see that I did indeed recommend the below coins this morning at 3am, and yesterday).

Performance Today:

BCC: The recommendation is still to hold through Christmas but feel free to sell if you enjoyed the short term gains from today, 10-25% a day is a great return.

BAT: I sold for a 25% profit (if you purchased today or yesterday you would have too!). It spiked literally 2 minutes after the founder started speaking which I forewarned all about! It has since increased another 10%! Remember pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered. Take 20% daily gains when you can.

NXT: Bittrex came out and said the NXT airdrop will be supported by their exchange (the price jumped 30+%) which means you will not have to transfer NXT off to Bittrex to receive IGNIS coins. I expect the price to continue to rise leading up to the airdrop by a minimum of 50%. I hope you’ve been following my posts, NXT has made all 3. Today was the day the price corrected, but the value should still climb 100%. Holding for at least a week.

WAVES: Airdrop bonus announced on Binance! The real airdrop will occur on the 1st, snapshot occurring on the 31st, but if you are going to buy WAVES you mine as well do it on BInance which is running a promotion to Airdrop 10,000WAVES randomly on the 28th based on those who have purchased from now until the 28th.  If you are going to purchase WAVEs purchase on Binance. Preferably use the referral link in my post on my user account (subscribe).

MCO: Has increased over 20% today and I believe will continue to increase leading up to 3 significant announcements on the 24th.

Stayed tuned tomorrow for more picks (today’s were 4/4) and upcoming events to be prepared for! Feel free to follow, leave comments, and upvote!

XRP,Altcoin,Have $500 left to Invest,"Started with $1200, and spent 700 on acquiring XRP, XML, DENT, TRX, ADT, . Bought NXT @ $2, so that didn't pan out for me at all, and to round it out since I didn't have a lot of money to invest I bought a few ENG, QASH and WABI. Also invested in longer hodls hoping to moon I invested into MoonCoin, Reddcoin, XP, DOGE and KIN. All this based on reading recommendations on reddit for the past 2 weeks and researching the coins. So any recommendations will be appreciated along with why you would recommend the coin, as I have come across some coins that I felt had no real purpose then to make money for people invested in it from the beginning. Wish I had more money to invest since the beginning but such is life of a student. Also Coinbase wait times are horrible right now so I have time to research some more coins.",11,2018-01-04 07:46:16,26

First of all contrary to normal recommendations I do not want to diversify, in fact I prefer the opposite. 

I currently have 25% in each of Ark, Nav, Vert and Ripple and am looking to scale this down to just two coins.

If you were in my position and wanted to pull out of one, or even two of these coins, which would you choose?

I feel the weakest of the four is Ripple.",24,2017-11-18 21:22:31,26

XRP,Altcoin,My portfolio - roast me!,"This is my portfolio, 40% in ETH as I'm a believer in ETH 2.0 making ETH the first blockchain with high consumer and institutional adaption, PoS, scalability and so on. 

Rest is a mix of handpicked coins and the top market cap coins. Planning a 40:60 ratio for the time being. Thoughts? Also any particular technologies or niches I am not exposed to? Would love your thougts on that aswell.

The handpicked coins are:

* LTO

Low market cap (\~250th), being used, top 10 on-chain transactions. Check out their partnerships with UN and more on their website.

* LINK

Serves to get exposure to oracle technology. Also a top 10-15 market cap coin.

* CAKE

Because BSC is the alternative to Ethereum for the time being. PancakeSwap has higher volume than Uniswap recently. Kind of a hedge against ETH also?

* BAT

For the disruptive potential on the whole online experience and already solid adaption. Users are increasing every week.

* UNI

Because it is the largest DEX, to get exposure to true DeFi as opposed to XRP, BNB, CAKE that are all centralized in some way.

I have also chosen to ban some coins (subject to change), these are:

DOGE, BCH, LTC

These coins have in common that their primary usecase is as payment tokens.

The rest (BNB, XRP, ADA and DOT) are the top market cap coins excluding BTC that I don't already hold.

XRP,Altcoin,The NEW relationship between Bitcoin and Altcoins... Times are a'changing. THEORY. <3,"     It's my belief that the relationship between bitcoin and altcoins is beginning to shift a ton... i.e., up until very recently alts would correspond positively to a drop in bitcoin (go down as well), and even when bitcoin would go up by significant amount, alts may drop due to people reinvesting in bitcoin, as it preformed well. 

     It's my belief that this relationship is actually beginning to change, significantly, and there's seven (and probably more) reasons why: 1) Bitcoin is losing more and more market share to alt coins everyday @ a significant rate 2) Bitcoin's price has been recently falling and on a continuing basis 3) Bitcoin has significant problems (high fees and a slow network, also, it is nothing but a store of oversold value) 4) There's been a crazy amount of negative press towards Bitcoin, while there's been many positive articles about various altcoins/ ICO's with their promising new tech and all the crazy percentage increases that have significantly outperformed even bitcoin's high ROI, all last year (these new articles, all while bitcoin continues its' slide 5) in the last week or so, the alt coin market as a whole has been a better investment than bitcoin, i.e. out preformed, and people are beginning to pay attention to all these new tickers 6) now the biggest one, FOMO... as bitcoin slides from a very expensive and questionably high price, and as people get bombarded with these negative articles about BTC and its' future, more and more people are beginning to believe that that boat has already sailed, while all these alt coins, with much better tech and prices sometimes in the pennies, are preforming well (better than BTC)... 7) there's a large amount of people that have bought BTC in the last couple months, for the first time (as Bitcoin, aka crypto in general is the ""future""), and these new investors were planning on investing more than once, i.e. paycheck to paycheck, Christmas money, increased potential gain, 2018 investments, etc... because they're becoming more and more aware that a lot of people are still making money in other currencies, while they watch their first investment drop 30-40%, FOMO kicks in again, not to forget that these first time investors just experienced first hand, what they now see as BTC... something intangible that took 2 days or much more to arrive, while they are paying/ have payed sometimes 50-hundreds of dollars in fees (often paying more in fees than the cost of their btc) to buy/ send their BTC. 
 
     Now, all these second time buyers, even the 3rd and 4th time, as well those just starting are beginning to take their money and invest in alts, many possibly even selling their bitcoin at a significant loss (price is declining much)... especially, so they don't miss out on actually possibly making all the money they dreamed of, originally... and keep in mind all these new investors are just used to btc goin up, they weren't in it for the previous drops... They want easy quick money and bitcoin is proving to NOT be quite that... Thus, people are afraid they are missing out FOMOing on these often higher ROI's and possibly on betting on/ investing early on in the NEXT (remember all the negativity, flaws, and downward movement) bitcoin, the ""bitcoin 2.0"". This all leads me to believe, that the new relationship between bitcoin and alt coins is, now, almost inverse to its' previous relationship, when bitcoin declines, new money is now coming to the alt coin market... and, even, as bitcoin begins to slowly crawl back, this won't be enough for the dreams they had/ still have, remember now many (thanks to the media and articles like ""These 5 cryptocurrencies did way better than bitcoin last year""... or ""today""). While bitcoin slides, all the money that was originally earmarked for bitcoin, actually is starting to get invested into alt coins (take for example, the 150% increase in ripple, making ripple have a larger market cap than ethereum, even though it is/ was way overbought, has a ridiculously large number of outstanding coins (SO BIG), and it is not even clear if any bank at all is actually going to use the xrp token in the future, but, let's remember that ripple is an extremely popular investment for those new to crypto, BIG NAME, 3rd now 2nd largest, banks!, it's just $1-2! (...if it just went to half of bitcoin's price LOLOL, I'd be rich!, and it has been going up while bitcoin slides... So, here and increasingly so, we will see a disproportionate amount of new or existing BTC money be invested into alt coins, while bitcoin likely continues to lose billions in market cap. This is my new understanding/ theory... LOL, sorry for the rant, but I believe 2018 will be a good year for alts, blockchain, and crypto at large, but a bad year for Bitcoin. Who wants to bet how quickly this will get deleted from r/bitcoin, LOL.",2,2017-12-31 04:25:43,21
XRP,Altcoin,Which coin(s) to hodl more of in this bear market?,"So, I am but a very small fish in a very large pond, but I don't intend to miss out on these low prices.

XRP,Altcoin,Which altcoin with <50mio market cap is undervalued?,"At the beginning of this year:

- ANS / NEO's market cap was $7mio (now 328)
- Zcash $18mio (now 360)
- Waves $31mio (now 330)
- BTC from $6000mio to $44000mio.

I never thought some of the altcoins would multiplier x5 (or more) in less than a year.

XRP,Altcoin,AMA/ELI5 Why Arbitrage Spreads Occur in Cryptocurrency? How to Spot them in Real-time & Trade them Like a Pro? Wouldn’t One Whale be able take up all the Volume?,"First I want to give you a brief intro of myself... Last November - December I started noticing arbitrage opportunities occurring quite frequently in cryptocurrency markets just before and during the bull run and it is happening all over again! I was able to capitalize off of every single arbitrage deal I ever acted on... 20% or more each time in a matter of minutes. This led me to create my own arbitrage platform so I can could get alerted to these arbitrage occurrences in real-time. Here is a nice strategy I developed I 'd like to share with everyone...

##Be Ready at all times

* having money in **USDT** ready at all times on the exchanges you are comfortable arbitraging on 

* get an arbitrage alert platform that gets you the info you need to see the quickest 

* once you spot an arbitrage opportunity or get an alert act on it as fast as you can



##Follow this quick checklist:

✔️ act on HIGH VOLUME arbitrage opportunities (unless you are investing small amounts which is supported by the current volume)

✔️ act ONLY on arbitrage opportunities based on profit potential of 13% or more

✔️ MAKE SURE WALLETS ARE ONLINE on both exchanges

✔️ buy as many coins you desire from the exchange it is selling much cheaper while paying attention to make sure the spread still exists by checking the exchange it is selling for at a much higher rate

✔️ once you are done accumulating, transfer to the other exchange and sell as fast as you can 


>From my experience I was able to transfer most ERC20 coins in 7-10 minutes time and sell them pretty fast (40k worth) over a few minutes time. Some coins are known to transfer fast like XRP, ETH, Nano, etc. so it is wise to be familiar with coin transfer times. There are some like BTG that transferred on average of 15 minutes to 30 minutes although one time it took 3 hours but I was still able to make at least 18% or more every arbitrage opportunity I ever acted on. 

## Let's talk about why arbitrage opportunities occur?

A seasoned trader will understand that most coin prices begin to rise when breaking certain resistances and trend lines. News will sometimes create arbitrage opps but they are mainly caused by huge money being pumped into coins by institutions. Last December we seen that most coins chart displayed extremely bullish patterns. Once they broke resistance it usually rockets up to a higher price and usually starts forming a new pattern that will allow the price to go even higher. The amounts of cash flowing into coins at a much faster rate creates a spread between exchanges which creates an arbitrage opportunity.



## Let me debunk the misconception that one whale can eat up all the volume for himself using an arbitrage opportunity that happened just yesterday

Yesterday **ADX/BTC** was pumped up over 65%. It was trading for **$1.19** on Bittrex and **$1.47** on Binance which is around a 25% or more price spread between the exchanges. The **24 hour volume** on **ADX/BTC** on Binance alone was over [**$51 million dollars** most of which was traded during the arbitrage opportunity](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*4_M7O1xV8ItuSFipsmeD4g.png). That is a ton of volume for literally thousands of people to make a profit from by swapping these coins between exchanges. I usually trade around 40k at a time during these occurrences and I have no trouble getting my orders filled in minutes while transferring and selling on the other exchange.

##Arbitrage opportunities are common before the start of and during bull runs

Arbitrage occurrences usually occur at the beginning of bull markets and we are beginning to see them occur more and more on high volume exchanges. This is how we see the market caps rise and prices of coins go up so quickly...  Today there was another that occurred for ticker **DNT/BTC** this time it had even more volume roughly **$70 million dollars** worth on Binance alone. Unfortunately I was watching the movie ""A Quiet Place"" at the movie theatre so I wasn't able to act on the alert I received. 

Feel free to ask me whatever questions you wish! Here is the [arbitrage platform](http://arbiswap.com) also here is a medium post I wrote that goes a bit deeper https://medium.com/@chasarcaulon/why-arbitrage-spreads-occur-in-cryptocurrency-and-how-to-trade-them-like-a-pro-51869422c5d5. I obviously am quite familiar with arbitraging and it is the only type of day-trading I personally do so let me leave this disclaimer...

XRP,Altcoin,Why You Should Be Staking That $BET bag right now.,"$BET is the native token for [Earnbet](https://luck.earnbet.io) Casino, the Original Decentralised Casino.

Built on the WAX Blockchain, it's the first Crypto Casino to go fully decentralised, offering players provably fair and verifiable games as well as full custody of their private keys.

Here's where it goes even better than the rest.
Apart from enjoying Chainlink Oracle Integration, which is a significant passmark, the Casino shares its entire profits from wagers made in Bitcoin & Ethereum to $BET hodlers who have their bags staked on the Casino. Profits from wagers made in other altcoins are used by the Casino to buy back $BET in the open market.
In other words, Hodlers who stake their bags get to claim dividends every month from player activity on the casino. 

So far since inception in 2018, over $9m in dividends have been paid so far.

$BET holders also enjoy Governance rights thereby defining the policy direction of the Casino.
With the coming Sports Betting features coming on the Casino soon, there's been a scramble for $BET by discerning crypto enthusiasts as that means more Bitcoin and Ethereum profits to share as betting volumes rise across board.

From a meagre price of $0.01+ in October 2020, $BET has hit $0.13 in mid February 2021 climbing slowly with sustained momentum. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/earnbet/

It will interest you to note that $BET tokens has over 80% of its circulating supply already staked for dividends with a significant value staked long term.

$BET can be purchased on Uniswap, BinanceDEX & HotBit.

https://uniswap.info/token/0xfdd4e938bb067280a52ac4e02aaf1502cc882ba6

Players also earn $BET tokens for each wager placed on the Casino tables.

PS: Get a $50 BTC Bonus on First Deposit. Earnbet accepts deposits in 14 major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, EOS, XRP, BNB, BCH, LINK, LTC & USDT.

There's also an ongoing $2,000 $LINK Giveaway for the Top 50 Players on the Casino's Leaderboard this week. Promo closes on 4/20/2021 12:00 UTC .",3,2021-04-10 21:06:57,1

XRP,Altcoin,Data from the top 20 fastest growing communities in crypto over the last month,"Hey everyone, for the past couple months I have been working on a project called [Coinmunity](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinmunity-bitcoin-altcoin-app/id1322869245?mt=8). Coinmunity is an app that focuses on the growth of crypto communities, which in the market right now, has so much effect in driving price changes. Each day it tracks which coins have the combined highest % of growth in their Twitter and Reddit communities combined.

&nbsp;

Today, Coinmunity has now been live for one month, so I thought I would share what patterns I have personally picked out, having worked on the data, and observing the rankings during development and while live.

&nbsp;

What I have noticed is that you will see certain coins start to creep up higher and higher into the top 10 or 15 communities consistently before a price increase. The best example is TRX. You can see from this reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7k2c4g/congrats_rtronix_you_were_the_top_growing/) that I made 27 days ago, that /r/Tron had the top community while it was still at $.01 ( and it continues to consistently be in top 10 even now.) I think most of us can agree TRX has some big issues, but the point is that it’s very important to know which coins have the most eyes on them; because when people are watching a coin, they’ll usually buy it.

&nbsp;

**Here are the 20 coins with the most growth in their communities in the last 30 days:**

[#1 TRX](/r/Tronix) -  **Price Change:** +2664.018%, **Total Social Change:**+3904.851%

[#2 VEN](/r/Vechain) - **Price Change:** +709.507%, **Total Social Change:**+974.497%

[#3 XVG](/r/VergeCurrency) - **Price Change:** +2005.76%, **Total Social Change:**+925.614%

[#4 ADA](/r/Cardano) - **Price Change:** +467.414%, **Total Social Change:**+714.406%

[#5 FUN](/r/FunFairTech) - **Price Change:** +366.608%, **Total Social Change:**+611.430%

[#6 REQ](/r/RequestNetwork) - **Price Change:** +646.897%, **Total Social Change:**+607.782%

[#7 BNB](/r/Binance) - **Price Change:** +546.153%, **Total Social Change:**+ 558.920%

[#8 SUB](/r/SubstratumNetwork) - **Price Change:** +619.376%, **Total Social Change:**+501.659%

[#9 XLM](/r/Stellar) - **Price Change:** +249.216%, **Total Social Change:**+501.642%

[#10 ARN](/r/AeronAero) - **Price Change:** +1020.204%, **Total Social Change:**+469.129%

[#11 ENG](/r/EnigmaCatalyst) - **Price Change:** +1162.809%, **Total Social Change:**+427.344%

[#12 MANA](/r/Dencentraland) - **Price Change:** +236.856%, **Total Social Change:**+393.404%

[#13 XRP](/r/Ripple) - **Price Change:** +812.067%, **Total Social Change:**+389.193%

[#14 ETN](/r/Electroneum) - **Price Change:** +60.470%, **Total Social Change:**+366.755%

[#15 QSP](/r/Quantstamp) - **Price Change:** +518.553%, **Total Social Change:**+346.401%

[#16 SALT](/r/SaltTrader) - **Price Change:** +76.836%, **Total Social Change:**+331.701%

[#17 AST](/r/AirSwap) **Price Change:** +561.384%, **Total Social Change:**+272.433%

[#18 THC](/r/TheHempCoin) - **Price Change:** +711.952%, **Total Social Change:**+265.797%

[#19 NULS](/r/NulsService) - **Price Change:** +587.179%, **Total Social Change:**+234.036%

[#20 QASH](/r/LiquidQash) - **Price Change:** +104.2105%, **Total Social Change:**+208.4238%

*Total social change => reddit and twitter growth

&nbsp;

It probably wouldn’t be the best decision to buy a coin based off just community growth, so Coinmunity pulls each coin’s full subreddit to make it easy to quickly research the coin and see if there is any upcoming big news. 

&nbsp;

**Some upcoming features that we think will add value:**

* Google trends

* Marketcap and volume rankings

* Track personal investments

&nbsp;

If you have an android, the app is currently in development, but I have made a mobile friendly web app that is available at https://coinmunity.co! I will announce on the Coinmunity [twitter](https://twitter.com/coinmunityapp) when it is completed.

&nbsp;

As Coinmunity continues to grow, I will start to collect more and more data on social activity surrounding these coins, such as retweets,comments, upvotes, etc. One relationship that I am looking forward to explore is the amount of exchanges a coin is available on vs social growth vs price growth. I think there is a sweet-spot before a coin is widely enough available to experience huge price jumps, where it would be the best time to buy a coin. If this is something you guys are interested in please let me know and I will continue to post each month about further discoveries from the data!

Selection of coins/tokens held are VTC, XRP, NEO, ARK, BAT, KORE, ADA, IOT, NXT, SAFEX, SC, CVC, STEEM and a small amount of BTC.

Also in regards to backup on mobile devices is it as simple as a string of words (is that the private key)? Seen people talking about .dat files and saving to usb but guessing this is for wallets on a computer?

XRP,Altcoin,That's my portfolio. I'm thinking about adding 1-2 new coins. Which ones do you suggest?,"Hi,
my actual portfolio consists of the following coins:

Bitcoin (BTC)
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
Litecoin (LTC)
Ethereum (ETH)
Monero (XMR)
Ripple (XRP)
Iota (IOTA)
Omisego (OMG)
Neo (NEO)
Stellar Lumens (XLM)
Vertcoin (VTC)
Feathercoin (FTC)
Reddcoin (RDD)
Golem (GNT)
Siacoin (SC)
Burstcoin (BURST)

I think it's a good mixture between high risk/high reward and low risk/low reward coins. I'm more a HODL'er than a day trader and I'm looking for good profit in the next 2-5 years.

Now I'm thinking about adding one or two coins and I'm not sure which ones. At the moment I have my eyes on Lisk (LSK) and NEM (XEM).
What do you think about those two choices? Do you have better ideas? 
And what about the portfolio in general? Do you share my opinion about it being somewhat balanced? 
Thanks in advance!

XRP,Altcoin,Why I think Stellar is gonna be the winner,"If you look at its growth, its sustained, it has its bubbles but compared to others it seems much more stable. It broke the top 10 this week, and should break into 9 in the next few days or week. Its backed by the company I work for IBM (i do not work on this project) which has lots of financial ties and is really into the financial and insurance industry. IBM has the number 3 cloud provider service in the world, and the transaction time is much faster than BTC/LTC/ETH. I think by years end it should be a top 5. I invest in XRP/ADA/XLM/0x/ and a few other long shots. I have much 4x as much cash in Ripple, and ADA but XLM seems more solid and lest bursty. If your looking for a great longterm, this one has all the markings of a successful stock. You should put some cash in it now. I traded out all my LTC and ETH this week and went all in on the non top 3 (then). ",14,2018-01-01 02:52:46,7

XRP,Altcoin,ELI5 - How will altcoins be able to serve their purposes?,"I've invested in all sorts of crypto and have made my investing decisions based off of the potential benefits these different altcoins can serve.  However, my concern is that if altcoins are fluctuating so much in price, with no end really in sight, how can we expect them to be used for their original intentions?  

I feel like Bitcoin and altcoins are becoming more of a popularity stock market, that changes drastically daily, and am hoping someone can explain how there can be an end game with a stable market where people would feel comfortable using these cryptocurrencies in their daily lives, rather than a new digital way of gambling.  

For example, I know as a business owner, I would not want to accept $50k in XRP for a large purchase order of inventory with the risk of that $50k going up or down 25% the next day.  ",13,2017-12-14 03:44:36,7
XRP,Altcoin,$1000 bucks. ICX or STRAT,"I got just about 1 ETH in my binance account and I want to put it into either ICX or STRAT. I'm want to cut my portfolio down so I don't want to invest in both. Unless you can really convince my otherwise.  I feel like both are pretty strong buy and holds which is what I prefer.

Current Portfolio (feel free to critique!): ETH  XRB  XLM  WAVES  TRX  REQ  XRP  XVG  ARK

XRP,Altcoin,Looking for binance investment suggestions,"Just had another $100 deposit of LTC into coinbase clear that I want to invest into an alt on binance. I have about of all my crypto in LTC, XRP and XLM, about 1/3 each. Looking for something that is cheaper with lots of room to grow on a long term hodl, 6 months-2 years 

Edit: something that is ledger nano compatible is preferred!",0,2018-01-08 19:30:38,8
XRP,Altcoin,Best place to store/manage multiple coins,"Looking for a place to store and manage all my coins. I want to be able to go to one place and see the performance of all my coins and what i hold. Currently, it’s all over the place and it is starting to get frustrating. 

Current coins

BTC, XRP, IOTA, LTC AND TRST. 

What’s my best option?",8,2017-12-05 14:19:29,7
XRP,Altcoin,"Another week, another dip","Basically the title 

What altcoins are you hodling/selling /keeping for the short term profits? 

Have nearly 1 ETH lying around and would like to buy something in this dip. 

PS. I'm sure everyone would like to hear about coins less than a dollar, but comment your other alts as well if you wish to.. ",2,2018-02-01 12:08:06,7
XRP,Altcoin,Your top coins and realistic price expectations...,"I keep seeing tons of threads talking about favorite coins or which coins people think will be ""HUGE"" in the next year, but I never see realistic pricing expectations.  I think ETH will continue to be huge, but I see it topping off around $3k or so.  I think SC could be huge, but I don't think I'll ever see it > $2...  Let's discuss coins you like, current price, and your ceiling expectations based on market cap.",2,2018-01-05 22:58:34,7
XRP,Altcoin,$100 into each of 5 coins,"Title gives the basics. I've done some extensive research and also already hodl some of these coins but I'm about to put in a fresh $500 investment. Here are the coins I've narrowed it down to, I can pick 5:

XMR
XRP
VTC
ARK
WAVES
XLM
ADA
NAV
NEO

any advice/sell me on your coin!

I am leaning towards: XLM, ADA, VTC, ARK, NAV",3,2017-12-18 04:13:21,7

Shilling dumb coins over the past week, I can't keep up. Please list all of the shitcoins in the comments so everyone knows what to avoid.... I'll start VERGE. 💩",1,2018-01-06 14:36:59,7
XRP,Altcoin,Programs and wallet advice please,"Hi everyone, kinda a noob here, been doing light reading over the past few years and more recently, i was thinking of starting to invest in alt coins, not crazy but with BTC you never know. As usual i know everything can be unpredictable and understand the risk. I have been looking at SC, DOGE, SUB, EOS,XRP,XUC, QTUM, ADA, QASH, PHO AND DGB. i only mention these as this is what ive seen a few posts about, i will research more of course. My main question is what program and wallet to use. From what i have read, different wallets support different coins? are there any suggestions on what to use? Also would it be best to setup a bank account with an online bank rather than using my local bank details? Many thanks in advance. In work so will check back when i can",2,2017-12-07 10:05:07,7
XRP,Altcoin,Best Altcoins 2018,"HI Everyone, these are my altcoins for 2018. Curious on people's opinions:

CND Cindicator
TRX Tron
XLM Stellar Lumens
BRD Bread
ADA Cardano
IOTA MIOTA
SUB Substratum
XRP Ripple
BQX Ethos
AION AION

Question is which types of blockchain companies have the most upside for 2018. I am guessing companies that help make cryptocurrencies accessible to the general public ETHOS, BRD. Curious on people's thoughts.",5,2018-01-04 10:23:16,6

XRP,Altcoin,The Curious Case of Ripple,,4,2017-12-25 05:31:32,6
XRP,Altcoin,Anyone have advice for a newbie?,"So I've been trading crypto since the XRP ATH in Summer 2017 and long story short I'm looking to diversify my current portfolio. Recently I took profits from some coins from the past few days and now I want to diversify. I have been specifically looking into this coin/corp called MOD/Modum. The tech looks great and I read their whitepaper and I like what I see. The drawback here is I am hesitant to invest in a coin like this because I'm worried of it being a P&D, It's even being shilled on 4chan already - this worries me. (Linkies cough)
Do y'all have any advice? Does MOD look legit? Hope y'all can help a noob out.",6,2017-10-27 01:00:51,6
XRP,Altcoin,Sell NEO for??,"I am planning to sell all my NEO. Should I put my profits into ARK, POWR or XRP?

XRP,Altcoin,Hello everyone! I am new to this subreddit and relatively new to crypto (started in the beginning of November) and have a question regarding diversifying with alt coins.,"I currently hold ETH, XRP, and DBC. I want to hold off on investing more, but am considering trading some XRP to get some more alts. 

1) do you think I should wait for XRP to bounce back before making any trades
2) what alts would you suggest? I’m looking at Dent and a few others. Just want to know what coins I am not familiar with that I should read white papers on. 

Thanks for any and all suggestions!",1,2018-01-10 14:37:11,6

XRP,Altcoin,Best platform for HODLing?,"Hi everyone,

Been a long time lurker and just recently built up enough courage to buy some coins. I’m an engineer and firmly believe in the future of crypto currency, and I want to buy in on a few alt coins and hold on to them for a while. I’m using binance and coinbase currently, and have holdings of ADA and XRP. Is binance a good platform for holding for a long while? Or should I move them to a physical wallet... if a physical wallet is better can you make any recommendations on the best way to secure them for the long haul?",1,2017-12-19 01:02:55,6
XRP,Altcoin,US Banks no longer support Bitstamp transactions - looking for alternative methods,"I have been trying for the last two days to buy xrp on Bitstamp. The website kept telling me my card was declined. The bank (Bank of America) initially ensured me that they hadn't seen the transaction attempted. This had happened before so I wasn't worried - sometimes it took a few tries. But after another day of failed attempts, I finally spoke to someone in customer relations who said the Bank has disabled any kind of payments (debit or credit cards) on Bitstamp and other crypto exchanges. Does anyone know what banks / credit card companies in the U.S. can you still purchase crypto with after Feb. 5th? Apparently there was some collusion in early Feb. by major banks to snuff out the crypto markets. Anyway, this has me worried now about ability to withdraw some of my crypto investments as well when the time comes. Pls advise. ",7,2018-03-09 04:24:17,4

XRP,CryptoCurrencyTrading,What could be the effect on the crypto industry if Ripple eventually won its legal suit against the SEC?,"
This legal battle between Ripple and SEC has been on for damn too long and I just hope things turn out well for Ripple at the end of it all whether it gets to win or lose.

The SEC is basically arguing that XRP is essentially an “illegal security offering and that Ripple did not provide the type of financial and managerial information required by law."" Guess this has been the cause of the long tussle which has spanned several months and could possibly push into 2023. Meanwhile, since the inception of this legal battle, the crypto industry has experienced a rise in DeFi protocols and NFTs in particular.

While it has been a stormy ride for DeFi platforms in recent time, NFTs and NFT marketplaces have witnessed new entrants such as Snoop Dogg, Gamestop and Solis NFT marketplace. I was however wondering what effect a win for Ripple would have on the entire crypto industry. That should definitely shoot the price of XRP from where it currently is. But do you think the effect could spread beyond just XRP?",3,2022-07-12 18:33:10,2

A.) No way to purchase with actual money.

B.) Fees involved are ridiculous, so you lose a big portion of ur BTC

or 

C.) Impossible to know if it's a scam or not.

I've looked into coinpayments, Gatehub, and qryptos. Gatehub says you can buy with USD but it won't work for some reason, coinpayments seems like a scam since I keep reading and everyone is losing coins through them, and finally qryptos is just a rip off. The exchange rate to BTC, i end up losing almost half of the value of XRP.

So does anyone have a great stop to purchase XRP or use USD for XRP? Thanks in advance!",2,2017-12-14 20:37:15,15

XRP,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Algorand is a much better investment than XRP,"Last week during the big pump for XRP I sold my bags and swapped to Algorand, receiving 6.5 Algo for every XRP I held. 

The main reason I did this was because my target is to 10x my investment during the next bull run, and I think that it’ll be much easier for Algo to do a 10x from here than XRP. 

And here’s why:

Supply:

XRP has a total supply of 100bn, 10 times more than that of Algorand and it only has just over 50% in circulation. 

So there’s about 5 times more than the total supply of algorand still yet to hit the market.

Algo has 77% in circulation, so inflation should slow considerably in the very near future. 

There are only 2.3bn Algo left to hit the market in comparison to 47bn XRP.


Speed:

Algo can do 10,000 tps 
XRP - estimates vary between 500 and 1500 tps 

Algo is newer tech and much faster than xrp. 3.3second finality. 


Smart contracts:

XRP are working on developing more smart contract capability but Algo was specifically developed for smart contracts and the recent ‘Algokit’ developer portal on Algorand makes the developer UX the best in crypto. 


Security:

Algo is quantum secure after it launched state proofs. XRP is probably quantum secure too but there seems to be some debate.


Decentralisation:

I see these as similar for the two projects. 

Algo has recently launched one click nodes and will soon incentivise node operation.

Xrp doesn’t incentivise node operation.

I think once Algo does this will be a game changer for Algo.


Regulatory clarity:

Contentious one this but hear me out!

I think Algo is in a better position than xrp in terms of regulatory clarity. Ripple won the case yes, which was superb, but it was a win for the whole of crypto. It showed that it depends on the detail of how the asset was sold as to if it is a security or not, and if you look at the way Algo set up it’s ICO you’ll see that it was performed in Singapore, by the foundation which is registered in Singapore, and specifically excluded participants from the USA. It even did KYC to make sure it excluded them. So the only sales into the US market for Algo have been secondary sales via exchanges, which after the ripple case win- are not definitely not securities! 
Ripple are probably going to either fight the part they lost or reach a settlement which won’t be cheap, or potentially have to fight the SEC appeal- but Algo won’t even get sued! 



Price:

Algorands ATH was $3.28 
XRP was $3.84

Not much difference there

Currently Algo is 11c and XRP is 75c

Until recently these two crytos were much closer in price, with Algo priced higher than xrp on a couple of occasions in the last year. In February of this year there was only a 12c difference, meaning you could get 1.5 algos to every xrp (now 6.5)

Considering the differences in market cap I think it’ll be much easier for Algo to get to 22c from here to double my investment instead of needing XRP to get to $1.50. 

In the next bull run I think Algo will easily surpass $1.10 for a 10x from here but XRP will do well to hit $7.50

This is not fud for XRP by the way folks- I love XRP and made about $7000 on it last week. I think it’s a $20 coin one day! Just not before Algo hits the $3.07 it’d need to to justify holding xrp over Algo!",2,2023-07-23 06:13:36,2

XRP,CryptoCurrencyTrading,XRP is on an unexpected streak.,"XRP trading volume suddenly rose more than 500% per CoinMarketCap data. However, the price of XRP did not make any major move, leading many traders to speculate. At the time of publication, XRP was changing hands at $0.475, down 1.74% in the last 24 hours. XRP (XRP), Courtesy: CoinMarketCap Greater volatility generally leads to higher trading volumes in any market as seasoned traders buy and sell large quantities to capture profits.

XRP was a top gainer in the market on Sept. 29 as its price surged more than 20% following Ripple's major win in the ongoing lawsuit. In a recent court ruling, District Judge Torres ordered the SEC to turn over the emails of its former employee, William Hinman, to Ripple, after much foot-dragging from the agency.

Though the SEC's counterpunch is expected by many, Ripple General Counsel Stuart Alderoty is hopeful that this sixth decision will be the final one to allow access to the Hinman documents.

Likewise, the rise in XRP volume may have been caused by investors wanting to buy XRP at its current lows. Traders have probably been scurrying to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the recent XRP volatility. It seems that XRP along with Blockchain finance like Ovenue, Algorand is what is on the rise in crypto right now.

The total number of units traded between buyers and sellers, or trading volume, is, however, said by some observers to be an unreliable measure of investor positioning.",5,2022-10-02 03:46:53,10
XRP,CryptoCurrencyTrading,PEPE’s 24-hour volume surpassed XRP,"Have you noticed that PEPE’s 24-hour volume has continued to soar amid the meme coin mania, surpassing that of XRP, which has also experienced a surge in trading activity?  


I become interested in PEPE after I noticed that it has attracted considerable attention from investors.   


The asset’s 24-hour trading volumes have consistently surpassed XRP’s volumes in recent days. This achievement is particularly noteworthy given that XRP itself is experiencing a surge in trading activity.  


I consider buying PEPE as well as some other tokens, probably gaming tokens, MagicCraft, or some other.  


PEPE had a staggering 24-hour trading volume of $2.37 billion, more than three times the $710 million XRP saw on the same day.   


Do you believe that this is just a passing trend or should we pay more attention to this meme coin?    


It's interesting to note that this impressive feat placed PEPE in third place for the largest 24-hour volume among non-stablecoins.",4,2023-05-08 11:00:27,1

XRP,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Apparently, someone used to pay people to write sh** about XRP.","On Sunday (27 November 2022), Matt Hamilton, a former Principal Developer Advocate at FinTech firm Ripple, explained the origin of “most of the disinformation spread about XRP.”  


Hamilton, who is currently the Principal Developer Advocate at Protocol Labs, still spends time on Twitter helping to clarify confusion around XRP and XRPL Ledger.  


Earlier today, he said that “in the early days of Bitcoin Talk you could earn 5 BTC by posting FUD that XRP was centralised and a scam, and that this is “the source of most of the disinformation spread about XRP to this day.”  


Yeah, someone was DMing a bunch of people on there and offering them 5 BTC if they posted some specific FUD about XRP saying it was centralized and a scam. If you look through the old posts you will still see discussion of it at the time. The brain rot of BTC maximalists.“  


Yeah, that is how far people are willing to go, and I am barely surprised to hear something like this.  


Defi, GameFi (Axie, God's Infinity, Uplands, and new projects like LifeBeyond), and of course XRP, in spite of everything that has happened, seem to be doing well which is great however a lot more good things need to happen for crypto to bounce back as a whole and sabotaging other projects definitely won't help.",8,2022-11-28 01:33:27,2
XRP,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Only Binance Shows Holding 125M XRP As a Reserve, what could be the cause of this?","At press time, only Binance is showing proof-of-reserves (PoR) for XRP on CoinMarketCap, even though the altcoin is trading on seven other exchanges that have their PoR listed on the crypto metrics tracking website. Cryptocom, OKx, Kucoin, Deribit, Bitfinex, Huobi, and Bybit do not show holding of any XRP as reserves.  


Notably, u/cryptoinsightuk first observed this anomaly on November 26. The XRP influencer and crypto educator took to Twitter to seek answers, wondering if it was an error or if other exchanges did not hold XRP.  


XRP along with Blockchain Finance, GameFi (Axie, God's Infinity with promising new projects like CosmoGene and LifeBeyond to keep the momentum going) and a couple of other projects seem to be doing well even in these conditions however some fluctuations are expected.  


While users are still waiting for a response to this puzzling discovery, they are starting to speculate that Binance’s holdings are all retail investors who have left due to increased self-custody or institutional adoption. Consequently, they predict a supply shock that could see XRP spike to new highs is imminent.  


However, this is unlikely, as CoinMarketCap data shows that the token is actively trading on about seven other crypto exchanges that have also released PoR. It is more likely that some of these exchanges seeing only about $1 million or less in 24 hours of XRP trading volume have their holdings split in separate wallets with less than $100k worth of XRP.",10,2022-12-03 02:31:37,1
XRP,CryptoCurrencyTrading,XRP surges 8 percent amid SEC controversy.,"XRP is experiencing sustained buying pressure sparking a short-term rally amid the ongoing case with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs. Notably, the gains are correlated with events deemed positive for the prospects of Ripple in the high-profile case.   


Indeed, by press time as of November 4, XRP was trading at $0.489, recording gains of almost 8% in the last 24 hours. The daily chart indicates that the token peaked at $0.5 before retracing, according to CoinMarketCap data.   


Additionally, XRP could be poised to extend the rally if the token successfully breaks past and sustains the key $0.5 resistance level. In this line, if the token moves to retest the $0.55 barrier, it will likely hit the $0.60 mark putting the next target at $1.   


XRP along with GameFi (led by established projects like Axie, CosmoGene, and new ones like LifeBeyond ) and some finance platforms is leading crypto right now, the rest will follow soon enough hopefully.  


Elsewhere, the rally has been inspired by growing investor confidence, as reflected in the market capitalization. By press time, the asset controlled a market cap of $24.52 billion, adding over $1.62 billion within 24 hours.",9,2022-11-06 00:28:08,2

As I was observing the transaction I noticed a whale buying more than 300 000$ worth of XRSHIB!!!   
 Here is the transaction:  
 [https://xrpscan.com/tx/9BE43A0058FF4C358015CD89CE754AFEF201A6FF3D7E2C868B8C7E61DB00BD68](https://xrpscan.com/tx/9BE43A0058FF4C358015CD89CE754AFEF201A6FF3D7E2C868B8C7E61DB00BD68) 

The SHIB migration is about to begin. To the iso20022 global standard of blockchains, the XRP Ledger.

👉 **What is this blockchain – XRP Ledger? Tell me more about it!**

The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a decentralized, public blockchain led by a global developer community. Simply put, it is fast, energy efficient, and reliable. With ease of development, low transaction costs, and a knowledgeable community, it provides developers with a strong open-source foundation for executing on the most demanding projects – without hurting the environment.

The comparisons speak for themselves – XRPL has some of the lowest transaction costs out there – as low as 0.00001 XRP per transaction. Assuming an average price of XRP of $1USD, this is the equivalent of $0.00001 each time a transaction is executed. Compared to transaction fees on Ethereum, which can balloon to hundreds of dollars, and one quickly sees the economic benefits of using XRPL. Throughput is much higher as well, with the blockchain being able to handle upwards of 1,500 transactions per second, with an average speed of 3-5 seconds per transaction – on par with Visa, the global financial services corporation.

👉 **What is XR Shiba Inu all about? What is their mission?**

First, they want to bring crypto to the masses, and do it in a way that not only benefits humans, but also benefits our furry pets who keep many of us company throughout our lives. Second, they recognize that, up to now, there remains a large gap in understanding what cryptocurrencies are, and what they can become. XRshib wants to help bridge this gap, and do so in a meaningful, socially responsible, environmentally friendly, and best of all, in fun way!

👉 **What about the team’s vision?**

The vision of XRshib is to provide the opportunity for all of us to be able to easily and seamlessly use crypto in our daily lives. They want our communities to not only support each other in the use of XRshib, but also our animal friends who have so far seen very little benefit from the rising adoption of blockchain technologies. We look forward to a world where, through XRshib, we are able to play a role in the achievement of significant crypto adoption. In parallel, by leveraging the gains generated by the community, we envision helping and saving countless animals so that they can eventually find their way out of shelters and into good homes.

👉 **What are the core features of XR Shiba Inu?**

✅Zero Gas Fees – As low as 0.00001 XRP per transaction. This is equivalent of 0.00001! each time a transaction is executed

✅3 Second Transactions – Blazing fast with an average speed of 3 seconds per transaction; on par with Visa, the global financial services corporation.

✅Energy Efficient – XR Shiba Inu uses .0008% of the energy in relation to Bitcoin and 0.00018% of the energy of Etherium.

XRP,CryptoCurrencyTrading,CasinoCoin (casinocoin.im) on the XRP Ledger!,"**Statement**

In November 2020, CasinoCoin(CSC) had a change in leadership. CasinoCoin’s former Technical Consultant, Daniel Keller, stepped up to take the role as the new Chief Technical Officer and will lead the business forward in a new, more-focused direction. Daniel is supported by Matthew Cheetham as Chief Operating Officer.

Previously based in Malta, the CasinoCoin Foundation has been replaced by Eminence Ltd. on the Isle of Man. Eminence Ltd. will be the parent of CasinoCoin and CSC will live on, under a new rebranded identity.

Since the leadership change, CasinoCoin has been able to reach new agreements with multiple parties and define a clear strategy for moving forward. We have also secured considerable additional investment funding, led by the [Knox Group](https://knoxgroupplc.com/knox-supports-the-new-casinocoin-crypto-currency/) of Companies in the Isle of Man. This will ensure that we are able to deliver on our strategy.

CasinoCoin as a product will be heavily focused on Tier 1 & Tier 2 gambling markets. With the substantial new investment, we now have enough capital liquidity within the operational business to target a top 15 exchange listing for CSC. Due diligence is currently underway and we aim to be listed on our targeted exchanges.

With regards to previously announced proposals, FUD Limited – also based at the Hubb in the Isle of Man – is working on a number of exciting projects. FUD continues to work with SunCash on the development of a new DLT solution and we will continue to share knowledge and expertise where mutually applicable.

*In order for us to remain compliant with GDPR regulations, anyone who is currently on the CasinoCoin mailing list or a BRM user must grant Eminence Ltd. permission to email them. You should have received an email from us regarding this. If you haven’t received an email, please opt-in via this* [*form*](https://eminence.im/newsletter/)*.*

**Token Swap**

On April 20, 2021 CasinoCoin initiated a token swap from the CSC Ledger (CSCL) to the XRP Ledger (XRPL)\*. The token swap is taking place off-exchange only, in conjunction with XRPL Labs, utilizing the XUMM Wallet. The XUMM Wallet employs an embedded migration wizard which allows users to import their existing CSCL accounts and facilitate the swap via the app.Due to regulations, KYC is mandatory. Bankroll Manager (BRM) features like the Game Lobby will be re-released as an xApp for XUMM once the swap is concluded.

*\*We will swap GFG and CR8 holdings at a ratio of 1:1. If you swap your GFG into XRPL CSC, you will not be able to claim your GFG back at a later date.*

**Swap Details**

Swap Announced:January 19, 2021

Swap Dates:-Begins: April 20, 2021-Ends: June 18, 2021-Duration: 60 days

Swap Requirements:-Government-issued ID, passport, or Drivers License-20XRP on a separate wallet or exchange (Account reserve + Trustline)-Your CasinoCoin account secret.

Max Supply:40,000,000,000 (old)65,000,000,000 (new)

**Moving Forward**

We’re excited about the move to the XRP Ledger and we are looking forward to collaborations with XRPL Labs. This will present CasinoCoin a multitude of opportunities in the future. CasinoCoin on the XRPL is going to focus on being a fast and cheap payment solution for regulated industries. From our point of view, the XRPL is the most fitting solution for this purpose.

In recent years community-driven development, decentralization, and the ability to submit amendments accelerated. This allows the CasinoCoin team to focus on  core development, no longer having to maintain the integrity of the network. Being carried by the XRPL will also make it easier when it comes to 3rd party integrations like hardware wallets and exchanges. We are also thrilled about the DEX abilities and opportunities. Eminence Ltd. will support the XRPL by running a validator.

**2021 Achievements**

Community Following: The number of people actively following the progress of CasinoCoin has grown tremendously. We’ve seen a 400% increase in the number of active users in our Community Discord, our Twitter following has almost doubled, and we’ve seen a rapid increase in the number of people engaged in our Telegram channel. Furthermore, there are now over 11,000 people with CasinoCoin on their [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/casinocoin/) active watch list.

Active Wallets: Over 5,000 new CSC wallets have been created. More users than ever are actively holding or involved with CasinoCoin.New Technology: We are now in the process of swapping CasinoCoin Ledger (CSCL) to the world-class technology of the XRP Ledger (XRPL)Casinos: In the past, CasinoCoin was positioned as being the future of gambling-related payments. Now, we have secured multiple casinos that will support the deposit and withdrawal of CSC and negotiations with several more are ongoing.

Head Office: CasinoCoin operations will be based out of the Hubb and we are in the process of establishing our new head office. The [Hubb](https://www.hubb.im/) was a natural fit for us moving forward, being the home of blockchain and crypto-related businesses on the Isle of Man.

Market Cap: CasinoCoin had a total market cap of $3,017,702. On April 16, 2021 CSC hit an all-time high of $177,739,054, representing a 5889% increase in value.

Trading Volume: the volume of daily trading activity has also increased from a peak of $520,700 to $3,269,577 representing an over 600% increase in volume.

Exchanges: We have entered into new agreements with several exchanges that will support the buying and selling of CSC. Our mid-term goal remains to have CSC listed on a Top 15 Exchange, with a listing on a Top 25 Exchange in the near future. CSC is now more accessible than ever.

XRP,CryptoCurrencyTrading,XRP Lawyer John Deaton says SEC is likely to sue more exchanges before End of the Year,"With this in the works, there’s apparently a whole lot more shaking that is expected to happen in the crypto industry. This could mean another round of price plunge, possible delisting of some tokens and some pretty messy court issues.

While I am not against regulatory bodies sanitizing the market and setting things right, the flipside to this is the effect it would have on exchanges, crypto projects like VET, decentralized messaging Toklok token, BNB coin etc having to answer if they are securities or not; and the general effect on prices.

So Deaton recently tweeted saying “I say the SEC will sue an exchange or more than one. The SEC is likely to pick 2-4 exchanges that each sale 5-10 of the same tokens the SEC claims are securities. It could be 1 complaint vs several defendants.”

If this happens, then Deaton prediction that SEC Chair Gary Gensler is going to “sue an exchange whether its Coinbase, Binance, or another exchange by the end of the year” would prove to be correct.",2,2022-08-06 07:26:24,2

XRP,CryptoCurrencyTrading,XRP rises steadily amidst the bear winter and may break out of a $0.4 price value towards a bullish trend.,"Currently, the crypto bear trend has taken a toll on major cryptocurrencies in the space, including leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ripple (XRP) cryptocurrency has seen its fair share of decline, falling 90.02% from its all-time high of $3.84. 
 
Furthermore, XRP can be said to be in its healing phase as it has managed to push slightly above $0.4 recently. The price of XRP currently is $0.375 with a 24-hour trading volume of over $475 million. XRP has been on par with major cryptocurrencies like Stellar, Nano, and Zetrix blockchain which facilitates smart contracts and scalability using cross-chain technologies. 
 
Regardless of the crypto winter, XRP shows a possible bullish run if breaks out of the $0.41 price, and according to crypto potato, if a break out in price does not occur, it can as well invalidate the bullish structure of XRP.

XRP,CryptoCurrencyTrading,XRP Sluggish At Resistance – Will It Break Out After 2 Months Of Vertigo?,"According to CoinMarketCap, XRP price has capsized by 3.31% and is trading at the $0.3764 range today. But on a positive note, it was able to successfully bend the tables around on the 100-day moving average a few days ago. With that said, the price was able to tap the key resistance levels of $0.39 – $0.42.

Now, if the bulls manage to override the above price range, then XRP is expected to shoot for the 200-day moving average.

Ripple price is observed to experience struggles unlike many altcoins like $SAND, $CAL and $APE which have all seen some gains in the past week. And this week isn’t any better because XRP price registered lower this week than last week hinting a huge squeeze. 

Could the bulls potentially drop XRP like a hot potato since Ethereum price action is more promising to trade on?",6,2022-08-17 10:05:08,0

GoldenXRP is here to make a change in the standard of BSC projects, as it aims to lead cryptocurrency into a golden era and provide both, short and long term profits for all investors by revolutionizing reward base utility as well as shortening the gap between the community and the developer team through sheer transparent work and open communication.

Future long-term plans include Golden NFTs and Golden Game Arcade.

👉 **What is this blockchain – XRP Ledger? Tell me more about it!**

The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a decentralized, public blockchain led by a global developer community. Simply put, it is fast, energy efficient, and reliable. With ease of development, low transaction costs, and a knowledgeable community, it provides developers with a strong open-source foundation for executing on the most demanding projects – without hurting the environment.

The comparisons speak for themselves – XRPL has some of the lowest transaction costs out there – as low as 0.00001 XRP per transaction. Assuming an average price of XRP of $1USD, this is the equivalent of $0.00001 each time a transaction is executed. Compared to transaction fees on Ethereum, which can balloon to hundreds of dollars, and one quickly sees the economic benefits of using XRPL. Throughput is much higher as well, with the blockchain being able to handle upwards of 1,500 transactions per second, with an average speed of 3-5 seconds per transaction – on par with Visa, the global financial services corporation .

👉 **What is XR Shiba Inu all about? What is their mission?**

First, they want to bring crypto to the masses, and do it in a way that not only benefits humans, but also benefits our furry pets who keep many of us company throughout our lives. Second, they recognize that, up to now, there remains a large gap in understanding what cryptocurrencies are, and what they can become. XRshib wants to help bridge this gap, and do so in a meaningful, socially responsible, environmentally friendly, and best of all, in fun way!

👉 **What about the team’s vision?**

The vision of XRshib is to provide the opportunity for all of us to be able to easily and seamlessly use crypto in our daily lives. They want our communities to not only support each other in the use of XRshib, but also our animal friends who have so far seen very little benefit from the rising adoption of blockchain technologies. We look forward to a world where, through XRshib, we are able to play a role in the achievement of significant crypto adoption. In parallel, by leveraging the gains generated by the community, we envision helping and saving countless animals so that they can eventually find their way out of shelters and into good homes.

👉 **What are the core features of XR Shiba Inu?**

✅Zero Gas Fees – As low as 0.00001 XRP per transaction. This is equivalent of 0.00001! each time a transaction is executed

✅3 Second Transactions – Blazing fast with an average speed of 3 seconds per transaction; on par with Visa, the global financial services corporation.

✅Energy Efficient – XR Shiba Inu uses .0008% of the energy in relation to Bitcoin and 0.00018% of the energy of Etherium.

Other users can offer you a loan on that NFT. If you accept a loan, the funds get paid out from the -Lender's- account to you, and your NFT gets locked in a smart contract. Once you repay the loan, the NFT will be transferred back to your wallet. If you DON'T pay back the total repayment amount before the due date, the asset will be forfeited and transferred to the 'Lender'.

**💲Are they CMC and CG listed? Yes! Take a look! 💲**

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pawn-my-nft](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pawn-my-nft) 

**👉 Which blockchains are included?**

PawnMyNFT will initially offer lending on ETH blockchain NFTs with other Blockchains following after. Upcoming compatibility to be available on Solana, Polygon-Matic, Binance and more.

**👉 What are going to be the other features of the PawnMyNFT platform?**

✅P2P Lending Platform - find loans for your NFTs!

✅Rarity tools and Checkers - check and explore rarity for different NFT projects!

✅Social Upvote System - Check rankings and vote for listed NFT projects... -encourage the developers of your NFTs to register with us at

✅NFT Collateralization

✅Multiple Blockchains

✅Powered by Smart Contracts

✅NFT Project Advertising - ad space will be available for NFT projects to promote their art!

**👉 This is all too complicated! Give me an example!**

📍 for example Merk Quebarn has a bored ape worth about 33 ETH and he lists that he is accepting loan offers on it.

📍 Vitality Bootharon decides to offer 15 ETH to Merk for 7 days with 5% interest.

📍 Elton Mask ALSO decides to make an offer but that offer is for 20 ETH for 4 days with 8% interest.

📍 Merk decides to go with Elton's offer, Vitality Bootharon is devastated.

📍 Merk connects his wallet, accepts the offer, and sends his bored ape NFT to the Pawn My NFT Smart Contract

📍 Elton also connects his wallet, accepts the offer and sends the 20 ETH loan to the Pawn My NFT Smart Contract

📍 The Smart Contract delivers the 20 ETH loan to Merk Quebarn

📍 The Smart Contract uses the force and generates an NFT for both users that acts as proof of transaction.

📍 After the agreed upon 4 days, two things can happen.

📍 If Merk pays back the 20 ETH loan plus 8% before the grace period ends, his bored ape NFT gets released from the Pawn My NFT Smart Contract and goes back to his wallet and the 20 ETH + 8% interest repayment goes to Elton's wallet.

📍 If Merk cannot pay back the loan, the Smart Contract will unlock his bored ape NFT and Elton will be allowed to claim it after the grace period ends.

**👉 Tell me some of the important dates on the roadmap to check the progress of the project**

XRP,CryptoCurrencyTrading,🌕 GoldenXRP | Launched 2 Days Ago | Up to 15% XRP Rewards From Transactions | CG Listing Imminent | Crypto Messiah Tweet | Youtube Video Released!,"Let's face it, we've all had our fair share of losses in the BSC before, no matter how carefully you invest, you still have to go through a steep learning curve to be able to recognize value and legitimacy in projects. But even then, you may still lose money whether it's due to the dev's shadiness or sometimes simply because of missing the pump.

GoldenXRP is here to make a change in the standard of BSC projects, as it aims to lead cryptocurrency into a golden era and provide both, short and long term profits for all investors by revolutionizing reward base utility as well as shortening the gap between the community and the developer team through sheer transparent work and open communication. After all, it's for the benefit of both parties that the token succeeds. Fair launch took place yesterday and huge marketing is about to kick in. Future long-term plans include Golden NFTs and Golden Game Arcade. 

💸 Automatic XRP rewards airdropped hourly to all holders' wallets. No need to claim anything! 

📝 Pre-launch audit successfully passed. GoldenXRP is now certified by Nexus Solidity. 

🦎 CG listing coming any time now! 

🏆 Total of $2000 to be won in the latest competition. To be eligible, you just have to transfer your XRP rewards back into GoldenXRP! 

🎯 A carefully prepared marketing plan is being implemented at the moment, one that aligns with the roadmap, to achieve the token's short and long term targets. Poocoin and Coinsniper ads are ongoing. Crypto Messiah just tweeted about the token and they also released a Youtube influencer video a few minutes ago!

⚙️ 15% tax on every buy that is redistributed in the following manner: 7% to holders, 2% to the liquidity pool and 6% to the marketing wallet. Moreover, holders will receive 15% in rewards from sell transactions due to the increased tax of 23% on sells.

🔒 Liquidity is locked for 1 year

XRP,CryptoCurrencyTrading,🌕 GoldenXRP | Launched 2 Days Ago | Audit | 7%/15% XRP Rewards From Transactions | CG Listing Imminent | $2000 Competition Ongoing | Youtube Video Out!,"Let's face it, we've all had our fair share of losses in the BSC before, no matter how carefully you invest, you still have to go through a steep learning curve to be able to recognize value and legitimacy in projects. But even then, you may still lose money whether it's due to the dev's shadiness or sometimes simply because of missing the pump.

GoldenXRP is here to make a change in the standard of BSC projects, as it aims to lead cryptocurrency into a golden era and provide both, short and long term profits for all investors by revolutionizing reward base utility as well as shortening the gap between the community and the developer team through sheer transparent work and open communication. After all, it's for the benefit of both parties that the token succeeds. Fair launch took place 2 days ago and huge marketing is about to kick in. Future long-term plans include Golden NFTs and Golden Game Arcade. 

💸 Automatic XRP rewards airdropped hourly to all holders' wallets. No need to claim anything! 

📝 Pre-launch audit successfully passed. GoldenXRP is now certified by Nexus Solidity. 

🦎 CG listing coming any time now! 

🏆 Total of $2000 to be won in the latest competition. To be eligible, you just have to transfer your XRP rewards back into GoldenXRP! 

🎯 A carefully prepared marketing plan is being implemented at the moment, one that aligns with the roadmap, to achieve the token's short and long term targets. Poocoin and Coinsniper ads are ongoing. Crypto Messiah just tweeted about the token and they also released a Youtube influencer video today!

⚙️ 15% tax on every buy that is redistributed in the following manner: 7% to holders, 2% to the liquidity pool and 6% to the marketing wallet. Moreover, holders will receive 15% in rewards from sell transactions due to the increased tax of 23% on sells.

🔒 Liquidity is locked for 1 year

XRP,CryptoCurrencyTrading,🌕 GoldenXRP | 5 Days Old |50K Market Cap | Audited | 50% Off On Buy Taxes For 6 Hours | Up to 15% XRP Rewards From Transactions | CG Listing Imminent,"Let's face it, we've all had our fair share of losses in the BSC before, no matter how carefully you invest, you still have to go through a steep learning curve to be able to recognize value and legitimacy in projects. But even then, you may still lose money whether it's due to the dev's shadiness or sometimes simply because of missing the pump.

GoldenXRP is here to make a change in the standard of BSC projects, as it aims to lead cryptocurrency into a golden era and provide both, short and long term profits for all investors by revolutionizing reward base utility as well as shortening the gap between the community and the developer team through sheer transparent work and open communication. After all, it's for the benefit of both parties that the token succeeds. Fair launch took place 5 days ago and huge marketing is about to kick in. Future long-term plans include Golden NFTs and Golden Game Arcade. 

⏳You will be able to buy with 50% less taxes for a limited time, until 7 pm UTC tonight! 

💸 Automatic XRP rewards airdropped hourly to all holders' wallets. No need to claim anything! 

📝 Pre-launch audit successfully passed. GoldenXRP is now certified by Nexus Solidity. 

🦎 CG listing coming any time now! 

🎯 A carefully prepared marketing plan is being implemented at the moment, one that aligns with the roadmap, to achieve the token's short and long term targets. Poocoin and Coinsniper ads are ongoing. Crypto Messiah already tweeted about the token and they also released a Youtube influencer video 3 days ago! 

⚙️ 15% tax on every buy that is redistributed in the following manner: 7% to holders, 2% to the liquidity pool and 6% to the marketing wallet. Moreover, holders will receive 15% in rewards from sell transactions due to the increased tax of 23% on sells.

🔒 Liquidity is locked for 1 year

MetaXRP’s vision is to become one of the top rewards token on the Binance Smart Chain by the automatic redistribution of 10% XRP to all holders.

Phase 2

⁃ Dashboard release

⁃ Continued marketing

⁃ CG application

More to come!!

UPDATE Response from Binance Support
Hello, Thank you for contacting support. Due to a high volume of ripple being transferred the last couple days the XRP blockchain is under heavy congestion.

We advise you to wait patiently for your deposit/withdrawal to go through as it can take more then 48hours in some instances. (No exact ETA can be given) .

For now we have suspended XRP withdrawals until the blockchain is more stable.

Included is a graphic to illustrate the severe volume of XRP causing the congestion. You can monitor the volume at the following link:https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/value

Thank you for understanding and your continued patronage.",11,2017-12-29 23:15:57,83

XRP,Binance,Ripple or Bitcoin," Bitcoin is more popular cryptocurrency than Ripple, with a much larger market cap.

Typically, a significant increase in XRP value usually occurs when crypto leaders such as BTC and ETH are showing bullish gains.

Many are also worried about the centralization of XRP — many crypto enthusiasts believe the token is unacceptably centralized due to its connection to the Ripple system. Supporters of decentralization say that this undermines the whole idea of   digital assets, which is that such assets should be decentralized and should not be controlled by anyone.

It's interesting to see how Ripple will develop in the coming years. As Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in an interview with the Financial Times that Ripple could become the second Amazon in its direction. His words mean that the company is looking to diversify and become more visible in the digital economy. Indeed, Ripple has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in projects aimed at boosting blockchain use.

It says ‘Buy XRP’ at market price and the field is blank for the quantity of ripple that I want to purchase. If I want to buy 10,000 ripple coin how much ethereum will that cost me. 

If I look on the right side of the screen it says ‘XRP/ETH’ 0.00150100. 

I thought that I would be dividing 10,000 by .00150100 to get the amount of ripple but it doesn’t make sense.

Buy ripple:

b- Make purchase based on market or limit price 

Next:    
1- After the transaction is complete, how do I save the bought ripple coins?  
2- Should I keep them on my binance account? If not how do I keep them secure or move around?  Or, how should I move them to secure place?

XRP,Binance,BREAKING: SEC Investigating Binance's BNB,"According to Bloomberg, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an investigation into Binance's BNB. 

The regulatory agency wants to know if the most popular exchange token is an unregistered security.

Binance launched its initial coin offering (ICO) in July of 2017. The transaction raised a total of $15 million. 

According to the report, the investigation is still ongoing. The exchange may not face legal action from the regulator. Projects like Concordium have aided in investigations by introducing ID recognition before transactions but it hasn't been adopted by other projects.

BNB, which saw tremendous growth in 2021, is still the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The coin is currently trading at $293, down 4.66 percent as a result of the news.

The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020 for allegedly illegal XRP sales. The outcome of the high-stakes case is expected to have far-reaching consequences for the entire industry. 

The Wall Street Journal reported in September that the FBI had begun an investigation into DeFi kingpin Uniswap.",73,2022-06-07 19:20:43,62

Much of Terra's success is due to the network becoming a mainstay in the DeFi world. As of Wednesday, the total value of Terra-based crypto projects exceeded $20 billion.

I believe that XRP is the true play to be honest! Right now i am bullish on a few projects like: Rise up, ATRI, PKT and Spores. Im very glad I've found them. DYOR!

Cardano (ADA) and Ripple's XRP also posted significant gains this week. Cardano's price is up 15.6% from last week, while XRP is up 12% this week. Apart from Aave and LUNA, Shiba Inu had the best week. This meme coin posted gains of around 19.5% for seven days in a row. The price is now at $0.000038.

XRP,Binance,Coins That Failed in 2022,"Many crypto tokens have made smashing debuts promising the moon to prospective users. But a lot of these projects have failed to live up to the hype in 2022. 2022’s crypto winter was a prime example of the described phenomenon, a brutal season for several projects in the industry. The total crypto market cap took a steep drop from 2021’s November $3 trillion all-time high to a frail $792B at the moment.

Crypto kings [**Bitcoin** ](https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin)and [**Ethereum**](https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum) were left scrambling to hold on to new suppors, recording 66% and 71% losses respectively over the year. With the leading names hanging by a thread other altcoins were not spared in the bloodbaths. Stablecoins took some of the market’s biggest blows. Also, as the metaverse hype began to die down, so did some tokens with ties to the sector.

In November 2020, the crypto market embarked on a bull run that saw up to 8000 tokens flood the space within the next 12 months. However, per a report from crypto data aggregator CoinGecko, 3,322 tokens that were listed on the platform a year ago failed to stand the test of time. Indeed, roughly 41% of the tokens listed in 2021 have now been deactivated on the aggregator. Let’s take a look at some of these coins and what exactly caused them to go six feet under.

**1. Terra Classic (LUNC)**

One of the crypto space's biggest disasters is the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. In May of 2022, the network’s governance token [**LUNC**](https://changenow.io/currencies/terra-classic) formerly tagged LUNA, took a nosedive, plummeting about 80%, making it near worthless. It's still unclear what caused the crash, but some suspect it was a targeted attack on the token and the network. Talk about a crypto sob story!

**2. Terra Stablecoin (USTC)**

Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin UST was hot on LUNA’s tails as it collapsed, losing its peg to the dollar. The reason for this was that UST’s stablecoin model meant the token was backed by LUNA rather than a real-world asset. Terra used a unique algorithm to ensure 1 UST remained equal to $1, however, in roughly 48 hours the token tanked, clocking as low as $0.26.

**3. FTX token (FTT)**

Making perhaps an even bigger mess than Terra did, Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire imploded in early November. As FTX’s dirty secrets spilled out the exchange went down taking its native token to the grave with it. [**FTT**](https://changenow.io/currencies/ftx-token) dropped from $22 to under $5 in one day wiping a whopping $2B from the market. It has dropped even lower since then, resting at $0.84 as users shy away from all things FTX.

**4. DEI (DEI)**

As waves from Terra’s downfall rippled outwards, DEUS Finance’s algorithmic stablecoin DEI was unable to avoid being swept along. The token lost its dollar peg amid the FTX melee and continued falling, hitting a record low of $0.1086 3 months ago.

**5. Acala Dollar (AUSD)**

For Acala Network it was a common story, the platform had a bug. The twist to this tale is that a malicious actor exploited the opening to mint over 1.28B tokens out of thin air. The network’s native stablecoin, AUSD dropped as low as $0.009 and has struggled to recover since.

**6. GALA (GALA)**

The downfall of Gala Games’ [**GALA**](https://changenow.io/currencies/gala-erc20) token began with a misconfiguration of the pNetwork bridge that led to the release of extra GALA GAME tokens. A dramatic drop in the token’s value followed prompting rumors of a rug pull. GALA lost 90% of its price and faced a series of exchange delistings that further worsened the situation.

**7. Axie Infinity (AXS)**

Its status as one of the industry’s biggest metaverse projects did not shield the play-to-earn (P2E) game Axie Infinity from the effects of the bear market. [**AXS**](https://changenow.io/currencies/axie-infinity) saw its market cap shed over $200M in under a month with the token’s price following suit. The price dump came as the Axie team shared plans to release 21.5 Million AXS tokens in what some tagged a suicide mission.

**8. The Sandbox (SAND)**

The Sandbox ([**SAND**](https://changenow.io/currencies/the-sandbox)) token has had a rocky ride owing to the recent collapse of the FTX exchange. The token has experienced some price fluctuations in the past and has struggled to maintain consistent growth in the face of market conditions. Data from the past few months shows a sharp decline in the price of SAND, and it seems that the bearish trend may continue at least in the near future.

**9. Neutrino USD (USDN)**

Neutrino USD (USDN), a stablecoin of the Waves ecosystem, has continued to keep investors on the edge of their seats as they hope the token will not end up like Terra’s UST. Outside of a brief stint in October where it managed to hold on to its peg, USDN has built a history of instability, failing in its very purpose as a stablecoin.

## Why Some Tokens Fail; Dead Giveaways for Dead Coins

Crypto token failure can come from a variety of sources - scams, fraud, poor management, and even exploits as shown in some of the tokens listed above. However, the general turbulence of the crypto space in the last couple of months played a huge part in the crypto decline. Indeed, the Terra crash dealt a major blow to investor faith in stablecoins, and the pertinent asset class suffered as a result. As an investor, it's crucial to do your research and understand the risks before diving in. After all, it's better to be safe than sorry (or broke).",2,2023-01-18 17:27:17,1

It will be a bloodbath, anyone holding Ripple should get out whilst they can.

$53bn valuation is composed of tremendous hype, true valuation is nearer $200m based on legacy bank deals who won't use ripple long term with much better solutions out there, including CBDCs - central bank digital coins, controlled by central banks themselves.

XRP,Binance,"FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Buy BNB for the trading fees, but do NOT ""invest"" in it.","Think about it...

the coin is entirely dependent on the existence/popularity of Binance. If either cease to exist the coin value will drop to zero faster than any crypto ever.

Buy some for cheaper trading fees. But for the love of god don't pour your money into BNB, it is foolish. I think BNB for lower trading is a great concept and I own some... but i do not ""invest"" in it.

Buy some (10$ worth ish, depending on your trade frequency) and forget about it. That amount for the average joe will be enough to cover all trading fees, especially as the price rises you will theoretically never run out of BNB at a .05% fee rate.

Just my 2 cents, would hate to see people get burned over a company issued, company owned, company valued coin.

XRP,Binance,A Guide To Transfer Coin Out Of By Binance.Com And Into Binance.Us For People Who Are Not Good At This Stuff,"Like many others, I recently logged into Binance.com and was told that I couldn't be supported because I live in the United States. The alert said I would need to create an account on Binance.us and that my account will be closed in 14 days.

I successfully got my money out of Binance.com.

However, I did not find this process intuitive. I ended up spending way too much time clicking around the confusing user interface, trying to relearn how to do things.

Hopefully this will save some other people some time. Here's how I did it:

I created an account on Binance.us

I did the required identity verification and multifactor authentication set up.

I logged into Binance.com, where I was holding three different types of coin. I had some bitcoin, which was the easiest to transfer out.

I transferred my bitcoin by doing the following:

1. I went to [https://www.Binance.us/en/usercenter/wallet/deposit/USD](https://www.Binance.us/en/usercenter/wallet/deposit/USD)

2. I changed the coin type to bitcoin

3. on the ""select deposit network"" section on the right side of the screen, I selected BEP2

4. then, on Binance.com, I went to wallet > Fiat and spot > withdraw > crypto, and selected bitcoin [https://www.Binance.com/en/my/wallet/account/main/withdrawal/crypto/BTC](https://www.Binance.com/en/my/wallet/account/main/withdrawal/crypto/BTC)

5. on the right side of the screen, I set the transfer network to BEP2, and then I copied and pasted the transfer address and the memo from Binance.us into the appropriate fields on Binance.com

6. I submitted the transfer. It was completed pretty quickly. After a few minutes, I have my bitcoin in my Binance.us account.

That was easy.

The harder part was getting my alternate coins out of Binance.com.

On Binance.com I had a bunch of ripple (XRP). I tried to do the same thing, but then found that Binance.us does not actually support ripple. I checked my coinbase account to see if I could transfer the coin from Binance.com into coinbase, and found that I cannot.

So then I tried to convert my ripple into bitcoin or something more universal. To do this, I went here [https://www.Binance.com/en/convert](https://www.Binance.com/en/convert) and set the ""from"" field to ripple, and set the ""to"" field to BNB which is Binance's own coin, I guess, which I assume has lower transaction fees.

But then, it said that I cannot do this because I was a US customer. For some reason, it let me, as a US customer, send the bitcoin out of my wallet, but will not let me convert coins between each other. Transferring out is okay, but converting between coins is where they draw the line, apparently.

So I used a VPN to connect to Binance.com with a Canadian IP address. Once I had a Canadian IP address, it let me complete the conversion of Ripple to BNB.

Note: After connecting via the Canadian IP address, I did not need to log into my Binance account again or reauthorize. I was a little bit surprised; you think if they were making it this hard for me to do anything, they would've kicked me out of my session. I was concerned that they would flag my account activity as suspicious because I was rapidly logging in from two different countries in the same browser session... but it all went smoothly. Your mileage may vary, but that was my experience.

Once the conversion from Ripple to BNB was complete, I repeated the steps mentioned above to transfer my BNB out of my Binance.com wallet and into my Binance.us wallet (the only difference in the process is that it was BNB instead of bitcoin).

What a huge pain. I didn't receive any emails from Binance.com alerting me that they were going to stop support for US customers. I wish I'd known about this when this change was about to go through.

I had to leave behind some other coin in my Binance.com account, because the amount of coin I had was too small to convert it to BNB or anything else. Not a huge loss, but pretty annoying.",4,2021-02-14 21:03:53,7
XRP,Binance,"The crytpo market just like humanity is connected. Once one coin is trashed it affects all other coins. I want a stable and fair crypto market that isn't controlled by one selfish, Greedy prick called ELON MUSK.","Fuck Elon Musk, if you really want and believe in a stable and fair Crytpo market. Fuck Elon Musk, he's a selfish prick whose already a billionaire but doesn't mind making it harder for others to even keep their homes. Don't take his tweets seriously if you're invested in Crytpo, his BTC tweets send ripples throughout the market and that's cause Crytpo traders take him seriously. He's just one guy, there's nothing special about him, you don't have to do or react to anything he says. If he doesn't want to deal in a Crytpo that's his personal choice, stop making decisions based on his greed, selfish tweets, he doesn't care about anyone except himself and he doesn't mind leaving people homeless to make more money when he already has more than enough. If you want a good stable and reliable income from Crytpo, spread the FUCK ELON MUSK, FUCK HIS TWEETS, FUCK EVERYTHING THAT STOLEN APARTHEID EMERALD MINE WEALTH he grew up on. He grew first class, lives first class and is now busy fucking up for everyone who grew up average, or never had most of the things or opportunities they wanted. Let's all spread the word of not taking him seriously, at all, he's tweets hurt every coin, not just bitcoin, so don't lie to yourself you'll not be affected. Cause those who are skeptical about joining Crytpo and then they see how a whole market is controlled by a Greedy, selfish guy, and it's because the traders choose to take him seriously when they have an option not to, do you really think if I was skeptical about joining Crytpo, I ever really would? Knowing that I could loose everything in an instant due to a single person selfish and greed. Whether you like to hear it or not ELON MUSK IS A GREEDY, SELFISH FUCK that doesn't deserve the power the crytpo traders give him, don't do anything or react to anything he tweets, cause that's market manipulation and he does it on purpose, he doesn't care if your kids will go hungry. Spread the message ""FUCK ELON MUSK AND EVERYTHING HE REPRESENTS, WE'RE NOT TAKING HIM SERIOUSLY WITH HIS CRYTPO TWEETS AND IF HE CONTINUES WE MIGHT JUST DECIDE TO CANCEL CULTURE TESLA"" cause to be honest mining for lithium is much more damaging to the environment than oil, and there's even a Zimbabwean who built a car that runs on electromagnetic waves. Screenshot and spread the word, do whatever you feel like, but if you're sick of experiencing losses just because of one guy, FUCK ELON MUSK. I personally don't have any BTC, but I've seen that it doesn't matter if I have them or not, once one Crytpo is being bashed by one selfish prick the whole market is affected, even dogecoin is affected with his stupidity, he already has a multi billion dollar company, and is now busy destroying any way GEN Z could ever get to financial freedom, when we live on a planet with gaping inequalities etc and he's busy destroying something that GEN Z and future generations could use to achieve financial freedom.",10,2021-06-11 04:53:09,4

XRP,Binance,DO NOT attempt to transfer into or out of Binance or any exchange now!,"Don't be silly and try to trade and deposit your xrps into any exchange now, and don't even transfer your coins to Ledger Nano S during high volume periods. It ALWAYS lags and then your coins go missing. Then you have to stress out and wait possibly weeks for any kind of customer support. It's the same story for Bitstamp, Binance, etc. Just hodl!

Edit: Didnt mean to scare anyone, it's just Ripple XRP that is jammed up on Binance (and every other exchange).

XRP,Binance,How did GoChain win community coin of the month when they have no users active in their reddit? Or twitter?,"So, where is the actual community that supposedly voted for GoChain? Because they don't have a real community. How does stuff like this never get called out? How do people not notice this stuff? GoChain has over 50% of their coins in four wallets, and they are not decentralized whatsoever. There is no mining, they never even did an airdrop. There was literally NO WAY to get the coin other than to buy it from them. Just another money grab that binance either supports or turns a blind eye to. Adding ravencoin doesn't cover up how you operate Binance.............",33,2018-10-14 13:44:23,13
