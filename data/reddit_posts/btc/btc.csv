BTC,cryptocurrency,Ethereum just hit a brand new 3.5 year low against Bitcoin. ,"ETH just hit a brand new 3 and a half year low against BTC after touching .03462 beating it's last 3 and a half year low of .03465 set just 8 days ago on Nov. 06th 2024. (.03462 means 1 eth is worth 3.46% of 1 BTC. )

In fact this means ETH has wiped all out gains against BTC since April 2021 when ETH was \~2k and BTC was around \~$60k. Since then ETH has completed the merge moving it from POW to POS and Proto-Danksharding (which dropped the gas cost on L2s). Still in comparing it's value against BTC, ETH has officially lost all of it's bear market gains.

What you might not know is ETH is not alone lots of alts continue to be down against BTC.

Chainlink to BTC is also sitting at a 5 and a half year low.

This list is not comprehensive but many alts are barely above recent bear market lows.

Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at a great cost to the environment.

The top rated post now is a post saying that banks consumed 520% more energy than bitcoin, even though the top comments are saying it's a bad argument, there still a lot of people who think the article is right, if you go on Twitter bitcoin maxis are always saying people are dumb because they don't get it how bitcoin is more efficient. Banks processed 200 billions of transactions last year against what, 200 million bitcoin transactions? You don't have to be a genius at math to see that there's no way bitcoin would win if it had the same amount of users and transactions. 

I'm not even getting into the argument that there are millions of people working for banks who likely would be working elsewhere and generating co2 emissions nevertheless. Those people work on different areas that you like it or not, are ""features"" bitcoin doesn't have, banks transaction output is not necessary related with their co2 emission because they do a lot more than sending money from A to B, you can't say the same about bitcoin, transactions = big energy output.  

""but defi is the future, we don't need banks"". You may be right, but if you look at sites like nexo/celsius, they are still companies with employees, they are competing with banks providing lendings, customer supoort, cards and insurance, not bitcoin. And they are doing fine.

""the media attacks crypto even though most a lot of coins aren't using PoW or will move to something else in the near future"". Hmmm, so you are saying there are better solutions out there and still its better to not talk about bitcoin's energy waste? Sorry, but this is just delusional. 

Crypto is at its core pushing technology forward and breaking paradigms, and with more adoption it also comes spotlight. If you look into the crypto space in 5 years and see that most coins and decentralized platforms are using something different than pure PoW, and bitcoin is still using PoW and consuming 10x energy from what it does now, you should think that's there's the possibility governments could act against mining, this year you saw hash rate drop with government-instituted blackouts in China, it wouldn't take much for countries to criminalize PoW mining if bitcoin is the only coin doing that and pretending nothing is happening while shouting ""I'm the king"". 

TL;DR: bitcoin's PoW is a cow infinitely farting, there shouldn't be negationism in this space about it as everyone else is inserting corks inside their cows butholes.",11170,2021-05-05 05:06:58,2408

So, basically I save as much as possible from every salary --> buy as much bitcoin every month as possible. When I have a stack of 1 million euros in fiat terms, I consider myself as successfully retired and most likely gonna quit my job. I document my journey in this blog that I try to update once per month, hopefully you like it interesting and motivating!

This got me to thinking about the first time I heard of Bitcoin. I was a freshman in college and a computer science major. It was Fall of 2010. I was in the lab when a Sophomore csci major asked me if I wanted to help him set up the \~35 computers in the lab for mining Bitcoin.  His plan was to mine every night after classes ended until 8am when classes began again and 24 hours over the weekend.

Me, thinking it was a waste of time with Bitcoin being like $.06, said no. The guy ended up setting up the computers himself, mining \~2,000 BTC, and in 2013 when the price hit $1,000, sold half his stack to become a millionaire in college.

(Looking at Syria, Venezuela.. etc) All those thinking they sit on a moral high ground calling for the hunger of millions of people are disgusting double standard subhumans that have no empathy for their fellow human. I've seen people dying of hunger in the streets and guess what ? The governments are still strong and standing cause this isn't a fairy tail where the good side always wins.

Double standard cause the US have done far worse than this in literally every war they financed and/or were directly involved with, yet if anyone mentions this they're accused of being Putin apologists.

I can't fathom how cruel some people can get and calling for the hunger of a whole nation because of the actions of their fucked up dictator ! Do you (americans) think that you, your families and tour children deserve to suffer and famined because of your government's actions in the middle east, Latin America and around the world ? Do you ?

Fuck every single government. Power to the people.

You don't understand the basics of decentralisation, it's NOT hooray decentralisation unless some with a different belief system is using it. God I hate this sub lately

Edit : I mentioned the US doing far worse to point out that the American people DON'T deserve living in a famine for their government's actions, same like the Russian people or any other nation's people for that matter. Not because I'm pro-dictatorship like people are accusing me of.. but I think I won't defend myself anymore cause some people are so agenda oriented and so blind to the truth even if you hit them in the face with it, and will always see anyone who speaks out against the state media points as ""Puting apologist"" or ""pro-dictator"" or whatever new trendy name is used for public shaming anyone who thinks outside the flock",5188,2022-03-25 10:26:59,1943
BTC,cryptocurrency,Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash are pumping...which means the latest batch of noob retail investors have finally arrived!,"I think many of you would consider Ethereum Classic a terrible investment, considering (1) it was the result of a hack, and (2) the hacker still has their bags of ETC available, which they periodically dump on unsuspecting investors. Bitcoin Cash doesn't have such a problematic origin, but might also be considered an unwise purchase given the lack of usage and development compared to BTC and other good projects.

So, when I open the charts and see that specifically BCH and ETC have been pumping hard for the last couple of days, my only conclusion is that new retail investment money has arrived and these noobs are dropping cash on 'cheaper' projects with the name Bitcoin and Ethereum in it. I should know, I did this exact thing myself earlier this year!

Here's hoping this signals the start of a another massive pump too.

But judging by things around here I am guessing the modus operandi is going to be more and more whining, this time about how they 'wished' they had sold.

BTC,cryptocurrency,Ripple is funding propaganda against Bitcoin by teaming up with the government to spread energy FUD,"Ripple labs has been funding ""research"" along with government entities to spread propaganda against Bitcoin and mining. 

In 2021, they funded a hit piece that claims energy prices for consumers in New York has increased by $6 per month because of mining. 

[Claim: Mining drives up household electricity bills](https://preview.redd.it/m0ta2tae4xb81.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=8079d16b0fde7bc74ebd204d4362ff823da26d3f)

Surely its not the soaring costs of natural gas that is driving up electricity prices, but mining? 

[Since June 2020, Natural gas prices have gone up by 350&#37; in the USA \(Henry Hub natural gas futures rolling contracts\)](https://preview.redd.it/iprxvhfj5xb81.jpg?width=2610&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4da2516b82eb585706d4d1af417320b5b82889e)

Surely, electricity prices that consumers pay have nothing whatsoever to do with inflation, or soaring gas prices that are in decadal highs.. but is due to bitcoin mining?!

Crude oil WTI futures are currently at 84, for comparison it was around 56 in Nov 2019 (pre pandemic). The last time WTI was above 80 was all the way back in 2014. Increasing crude oil natural gas prices, along with inflation that is at multi-decade high is not the reason for increase in household electricity, but its bitcoin mining that is responsible.. 

[Thats according to this study funded by Ripple in collusion with the Department of Treasury. ](https://preview.redd.it/a4z5aqnyaxb81.jpg?width=1944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6656489541bece07a0e9b83837d42345157f987c)... The same Department of Treasury headed by another well known Bitcoin hater Janet Yellen, who earned $7m as ""speaking fee"" from the same banks she is supposed to regulate but has tried to stifle Bitcoin and crypto at every opportunity. 

Research with ""financial support"" is nothing but propaganda, especially when it's funded by a competitor to bitcoin that lobbies with the government. Ripple continues to be a centralised premine scam created to enrich its founders. 

Ripple has also cozied up with the likes of WEF, the very organisations Bitcoin was created as a fuck you to. [https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple](https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple)

As its price and narrative around the shitcoin has stagnated, Ripple is resorting to dirty political tricks to get a leg up. As usual, they will fail. 

The narrative that bitcoin mining companies cause increase in electricity bills in NY is rubbish, as the largest BTC mining companies in New York produce their own energy. Infact the last one to start mining in NY is a hydro electric plant that was unused for years, before they started mining Bitcoin last year. 

[https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php)

The other large mining company Greenidge Generation also produces its own energy.


Edit: Buttcoin losers in comments say ""reee bitcoin move to POS or govt will ban it""

Yeah not too bright, the whole point of Bitcoin is that it cant be banned unlike the proof of stake shitcoins you support that can be created out of thin air at the press of a button and shut down at the press of a button.

Another one who is literally a war monger calling for Ukraine invasion but pretends to care about global e-waste. Lmao. Bitcoin haters are really a funny bunch


Edit: Ripple shills keep brigading and claiming where is the paper, of course if you are as bricked as a ripple fan boy you need to be spoon fed everything. Well here is the paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779720

And if you open up the first page of it, says

> **Benetton and Compiani acknowledge financial support from Ripple‚Äôs University Blockchain Research Initiative.**

i.e this whole ""paper"" is nothing but a hit piece propaganda sponsored by a competitor

The other writer of this paper is Adiar Morse, who conveniently works for the Dept of Treasury under Yellen: 

https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/prof-adair-morse-joins-biden-administration-as-a-treasury-department-deputy/

Seems like natural career progression - collect funds from Ripple to publish propaganda against Bitcoin, and get hired by Yellen who has been promoting propaganda against crypto for years now. Nothing to see here.

Final Edit: Jjust look at the number of freshly created ""Tin"" accounts that have popped up in the comments to shill for XRP. Didnt realize 2017 left so many bag holders. It must be real miserable with these heavy bags that are at 1/3rd of their 2017 ATH, while almost every other coin has gone up hundreds of % and made new highs this cycle. Thats what happens when you become exit liquidity for mccaleb, garlinghouse etc. 

Lol at the shills shouting ""REEE ripple is a company XRP is decentralised token"". They really did you good with this one small trick. 
Thats also the reason garlinhouse drives a shiny car while you are down 50% on your shitcoin investment. 

The D in XRP stands for decentralised. It was always a premined scam token and will always be one. Thousands of tin bagholders wont change this.",3886,2022-01-15 22:15:00,2655

What rubbish, if FBI can empty anyone's wallet they can get BTC from the top addresses and all become billionaires themselves. This is some of the weakest FUD but people still seem to be falling for this.


Edit: Lots of comments seem to suggest that governments are developing or have developed ""quantum computers"" that can crack/hack bitcoin private keys. While quantum computers can definitely become a threat to cryptocurrencies in the future, they are not presently anywhere close to being capable of deriving the private key for a bitcoin address. 

As per u/BreakingBaIIs : 

> I did a back-of-envelope calculation that showed that it would be faster to mine all the remaining bitcoins 6 billion times than it would to crack a single private key using brute force.

> If the FBI found a way to efficiently crack a private key, that would mean they solved the most important math problem humanity has ever faced, that P=NP (in the affirmative). What they could do would go far beyond breaking all of the Internet's security protocols (which they could do). They would be able to solve all the mathematical theorems that humanity has ever worked on for thousands of years, plus many new ones we never thought about, in a matter of days or hours. They would be able to efficiently create superhuman AI using modest computational resources.

The complexity of cracking a single BTC private key is large and currently not in existence. 

Moreover, if such a powerful computer existed, it would be a threat to several other things rather than bitcoin and crypto. The entire internet runs on cryptographic encryption. Nothing would be safe. In fact, someone in possession of much less powerful quantum computing power can easily hack into Federal reserve and transfer out every dollar there, or hack into Bank of England and shut everything down. In other words, cryptocurrencies would not even be among the top threats, because much bigger and important threats would be easily taken over. 

If they had quantum computers, they wont be asking Apple to de-encrypt devices seized from criminals. 

If they have quantum computers that can reverse engineer the private keys to any BTC address, they wont bother recovering measly 60 BTC from the 80 BTC ransom, when they can just send BTC to zero by hacking and moving Satoshi coins, thus destroying BTC's narrative completely. 

Tl:dr - Its preposterous to suggest anything like this exists. While it is true that research and development on quantum computers is an ongoing topic, there is no evidence to suggest that such a quantum computing system exists today that can derive BTC private keys from just the addresses.",6881,2021-06-08 12:46:41,983

BTC,cryptocurrency,You guys asked for it so here it is: I built a bot that buys Bitcoin when Elon Musk Tweets about it and open sourced it,"In my last post, you guys were interested in my bot project that buys Bitcoin when Elon tweets about it so here it is!

The bot was initially designed to buy Bitcoin when Elon Musk tweets about, regardless of the sentiment of the tweet. I have shared it with some smaller communities, and there was some great feedback on it regarding the main concern - what if Elon tweets: ""Bitcoin is too high imo"" and the bot buys at the wrong time.

So I found an API that would help me analyse the tweet sentiment, and integrated this into the code. The bot will now only buy Bitcoin when Elon Tweets, if the sentiment of his tweet is positive.

I have tested the functionality and the bot is quite stable, but I haven't tested how profitable (if at all) it would actually be, so if you're interested in testing it, please share the results with us! :)

The bot was built mostly for fun, and I wouldn't encourage you to trade with it on a live account! But if you want to have some fun with it and try it out on a demo account, here you go:

BTC,cryptocurrency,"If You Can Hold a 401K Plan for 30-40 Years, You Can Hold Bitcoin for 3-4 Years.","You also only have to buy into BTC once, unlike a 401K where most people keep buying back in every pay check only to lose what you earned in interest by paying a penalty if you withdraw too early.   Because that's the trick.  The trick to a 401K is to get everyone to hold because if everyone sells, then everyone else who didn't sell fast enough will lose money and the whole thing will crash.    That's why they charge penalities.    

It's like investing in safemoon and they charge you penalities for selling In order to keep the current value more stable so the entirety of holders don't start panic selling it into oblivion.

Also you can panic sell a 401K too.  It happened to many people after the housing market crash of 2008.    My mom panic sold her 401k because it went from $50K to $9K ...I didn't know much about investing back then, but I will never forget what she said.  *I was afraid I would lose it all, it kept going down* 

What she said sounds much like what people say about Bitcoin today. 

Nowadays my mom is retired, and sometimes she brings that up...*I should've just kept it in...it went back up*

Unfortunately this is how the most powerful people work.  They shake out weak hands so they can buy up super low.   Otherwise there would be no big guy buying your shit back.  

Rich are buying your shit cheap for a reason...not just because they are just speculating. 


So yeah, you can get serious FUD with 401K and it's not just coming from my mom. Many honest hard working people don't understand the game whales play...they get shilled into things and are convinced it's safe because their employer offers it.    All a 401K is, is investments into stocks and bonds that are stable but not always safe. 

So if you can continually dump every paycheck into something that penalizes you for withdrawing early and hold that shit for 30 years , then you can buy Bitcoin  once and hold it for 3 years without any penality for withdrawing some too early unless tax on capital gains. But that's normal. 

So stick to your original plan, and hold.",6819,2021-05-29 17:22:38,902

BTC,cryptocurrency,I went to the supermarket here in Venezuela and paid directly with Bitcoin,"Hi guys, as you probably know I'm Venezuelan living here.

Yesterday I had the chance of doing some purchases in a supermarket and paying directly in Bitcoin.

This was the purchase:

[The purchase \(I had purchased some things before, like fruits and vegetables in farmers market and chicken\/meat\)](https://preview.redd.it/skjk96ln8poa1.jpg?width=780&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fe20196dd1ee8b4e8b67bf1ec4116efae4b7d44)

&#x200B;

You say to the cashier you want to pay in cryptocurrency and their system shows them a selection:

&#x200B;

[The amount is shown in Bolivares \(Bs.\) so 725 Bs.  so 30 USD \(exchange rate is 1 USD 24.2 Bs.\)](https://preview.redd.it/mrh1wr9h9poa1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bd605c13966f94dee1cd3b37aff10619b5ea96a)

They say they will add more crypto and BTC LN.

After selecting bitcoin and and continue (Continuar) it shows the amount in bitcoin

&#x200B;

[So that is, 0.00124813 BTC, yesterday it was very volatile so even when BTC was around 27,200 USD using that rate I paid around 34 USD. Not much sense there, 4 USD more I suspect it s a fixed fee, wouldn't make sense be 10&#37;. After I took the picture he went again there and final price was 0.00124863 BTC.](https://preview.redd.it/74ejomjz9poa1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a26782597706df63ea58256b28fbcb9287ec0a1)

After that it shows a QR code, you scan it and have to wait for at least one confirmation after you get one confirmation (mine took several minutes) the cashier press payment received and I suppose it checks one blockchain explorer for one confirmation or pending transaction that matches the amount. If it matches it says payment received and receipt is printed.

I noticed each time you press continuar a new QR code gets generated, so new or different address.

I used Trust Wallet and the fee was 1.36 USD.

Receipt is shown in Bolivares, but that is common here even if you pay with USD, Euros or any currency the invoice will be printed in Bolivares.

Experience was good overall, but in this case I paid a little more, something to improve.

You have to remember that here the economy is destroyed:

&#x200B;

* Monthly inflation can be over 10% easily. Being it under 10% is a success.
* Monthly minimum wage is 130 Bs. (less than 5 USD, this purchase was 5x monthly minimum wage), average monthly wage is 120 USD.
* Since 2007 14 zeroes were removed from the currency, so this 725 Bs would have been 72,500,000,000,000,000

Thanks for the support to all redditors. Any question let me know!",2117,2023-03-19 14:53:22,975
BTC,cryptocurrency,TIL: there used to be a Bitcoin faucet that literally gave away 5 bitcoins just to solve a CAPTCHA,"12 years ago in 2010 a fellow named Gavin Andresen created the first cryptocurrency faucet;  he made this simple website giving away 5 bitcoin ( not a typo FIVE)  just for solving a CAPTCHA.  It has since been archived and what is crazy was that the snapshot on that day showed that there was still 750 Bitcoin to give away.  5 Bitcoin is basically 100,000 USD in todays price and at its all time high this would had equate to 325,000 just for visiting a website. More than likely you could had just visited once everyday or even more

From wikipedia source: Gavin Andresen is a bitcoin pioneer and was one of the few developers that actually developed alongside with Satoshi Nakamoto who declared him as the lead developer for the client bitcoin software.  Been quoted,  ""Bitcoin is designed to bring us back to a decentralized currency of the people,"" and ""this is like better gold than gold.""  He also conceived of the Bitcoin Foundation but sadly he stopped contributing in 2016 and criticize bitcoin developers for not increasing network capacity and later got involved in bitcoin cash instead. 

Anyways thought I shared a bit of fun history to lighten up the mood a bit.

 This is likely an OTC deal and does not directly affect the BTC spot price. They still hold 179.19K BTC ($11.7B) in the old wallets.

&#x200B;

 Now the crazy part about this story is that they transferred 30,170 Bitcoin (approximately $2 billion) with no regulations or paperwork like the bank does. 

 Imagine if you wanted to transfer that amount of money by using the bank üòÇ, they would have freaked out and asked you everything about this transaction. They would need to ask their bosses to come and see you directly, and you would have to sign A LOT of papers to get through with **YOUR MONEY.** Not to mention about how much the fee is and how long you could have waited for this amount of money to actually be ""processed"" and ""completed"".

&#x200B;

 If I were to risk losing my money between the bank and cryptocurrency, I would choose cryptocurrency because I can have control over it. I wouldn't have to wait for the bank to retrieve it for me or follow their instructions on what to do next, especially since they can be unreliable. 

What side are you on?

This quinn investment guy is a known fraudster who cooks up conspiracy theories, just have a look at his profile lol. 


Bullshit that has already been denied, like Tether holding Evergrande.. 
Infact this nonsense claims 78% of Tether reserves are Evergrande, which is total lies.

And that OP RT's nonsense like this, wishing for crypto to burn, but you all are assuming he is posting his ""unbiased opinion"" on bitcoin law. Lol


Edit:

Some comments are pointing out that I havent deboonked what that OP has said. I did actualyl debunk him last month, but then realised he isnt having honest debates but is just putting out propaganda. Given that he isnt acting in good faith, and is a buttcoiner, kinda pointless for me to debunk moreover, he is clearly lying that he wants to see crypto succeed, and instead has a very biased agenda. He is not debating in good faith. If you check his profile, he had posted that BTC would be a failure even before the roll out. Literally, before the plan was implemented and went live, he claimed it would be a failure. Anyone really expect this guy to be unbaised at this point? 

Coming to the protests, yes there are protests, but the protests are to do with politics rather than bitcoin. You will find one or two guys carrying an anti-bitcoin banner in the entire protest. Most of the protests are purely due to political reasons, that have nothing to do with Bitcoin. All those pictures he has posted as proof are all from protests shared on twitter, they have nothing to do with bitcoin except that fact that Bitcoin is implemented by the president, against whom all the protests are targeted. 

That guy claims Bitcoin rollout is ""not going well"". 

Stats from Google app store and IOS app store prove him wrong. 

The Chivo wallet is still #2 on ios app store, ahead of most viral apps like FB/ Whatsapp/Twitter/TikTok etc

https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/apple/store-rank/sv/all/


And on Android play store, the wallet is the #1 app too..

https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/google/store-rank/sv/all

The Chivo app is pretty much TOP on both app stores. Quite some failure huh! Definitely not doing well...

Just because there have been some issues during rollout doesnt mean its a failure or its not going well. Many mass implementation programs have problems initially, infact even the US covid stimmy checks took a while to arrive and there was implementation delays. Later, [WaPo reported that over 1 M checks went out to dead people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/06/25/irs-stimulus-checks-dead-people-gao/). Was that a failure too? 

Now lets look at some real stories that are success:

Over 3 million  users have downloaded the wallet. 

[More users in El Salvador are now using Chivo / have a bitcoin wallet than they have traditional bank accounts.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2021/10/07/in-el-salvador-more-people-have-bitcoin-wallets-than-traditional-bank-accounts/?sh=7ac1bb5020b5) - This alone is a massive win, in a country where huge amounts of people are unbanked, they have now instantly been given access to the world's most open and fair financial network. 

 Already, Brazil is considering following El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as well.


A country implementing BTC is not a race to the finish, it is a long term program. OP knows that too, but since he is a biased propagandist, he wants to put out hit pieces on a monthly basis

BTC,cryptocurrency,Bitcoin was supposed to be the solution to BIG MONEY. Now it instantly dips everytime when the stock market dips.,"To be honest, this makes me sad.

As far as I remember, Bitcoin was thought to be the solution of the fact that institutions, wall street and big money control the financial world and the pennies of the simple people from the normal population. And it was more or less like this, in the first several years after the inception of Bitcoin. We saw so much price discovery, Bitcoin being volatile, because mere mortals like us were buying, hodling, selling, wondering how much the *real* price of this asset is. It was literally supply and demand, controlled only by the psychology and the individual decisions of every single one of us.

What do we see nowadays? We go to bed, we wake up and we see that Bitcoin is at -10% for no reason. Literally for no reason. Neither me or you have sold. We were just sleeping. What happens? Bitcoin is strongly tied to the trading algorithms of insitutions and they handle it the same way they handle stocks. If the stock market is supposed to move down, bitcoin and crypto in general follows instantly in a nanosecond. We are not in control anymore. It doesn't matter if we buy or sell.

During the last few years, we welcomed institutional interest and we cheered. Now I realize that they have much more power than us and the situation is the same as it has ever been - big money controls the pennies, or in this case the satoshis, of us - the simple people.

It makes me sad, but in the end, this is an open and free market. Everybody has the right to buy, sell or hold as much as he or she wants. In this case, it just happens so that the big players choose to be massively invested in crypto, which gives us the spot on the sidelines - sit and observe how the price fluctuates, without being able to react on our own.

EDIT: I agree with a lot of you guys and girls. The same way sometimes we go to bed, wake up and see that Bitcoin is +15%. In those green days, nobody complains about it. What concerns me in overall is how tied the price movement of crypto assets to the price movement traditional assets is. I am not sure if this is an issue to be concerned about. However, it's a fact and I feel the necessity to talk about it and discuss it's impact.

EDIT 2: wow, thanks for the amazing discussion! I appreciate that so many people participate in it and share their view on the topic.",3055,2022-01-21 10:41:26,1245

He just got permission to go public with his work.","He's been talking about it for months on twitter spaces. Look up @ JasonPLowery on twitter to find his account. When looking up his background information, everything looks legit. This is probably what Biden's advisor meant when he said that his administration was mining Bitcoin, because from what I've heard this kid say in those twitter spaces, the stuff he's trying to do for them would involve mining and much more. His plan is to make Bitcoin the GPS and Atomic Clock of digital information, a solid accurate ledger to store important information away from things like internet rot or wiki edits.

For those who don't know, our current internet is rotting away. When you search on google, it claims to have billions of results for any subject, but when you search through those subject's results and actually dig through the pages, you only get on average around 350 to 470 links.

The other billions? They've been lost to internet rot, the result of links being lost or destroyed from things like servers going offline, losing the data of billions of results per search, the loss of things you used to be able to find online but can no longer locate.

This apparently is a problem for the government as a lot of those lost links were links used in actual court cases, leading to digital evidence being lost that in some cases have been used to set legal precedents. There's a lot more to what he's doing for the military via the usage of Bitcoin's immutable ledger, but this is what I can remember off the top of my head.

Hopefully he can set up an AMA with the mods one day. I bet this community would be very interested in hearing what he has to say in regards of what he's doing with using Bitcoin's immutable blockchain on the most powerful computer network on earth for the Space Force and the Defense Department's needs.

BTC,cryptocurrency,I analyzed the Last 3 Bitcoin halvings here's what I think will happen after the 2024 halving,"Hi

If you've never experienced a Bitcoin halving before, or if you have but are unsure what to expect, I've done a bit of research based on the last halvings. Here's what i have. 

The halving occurs every four years, cutting the reward for mining new blocks in half. The next halving will reduce rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.

Historical Price Impacts:

* 2012 Halving: Bitcoin's price surged approximately 9308% in 13 months.
* 2016 Halving: Saw a 2861% increase over 17 months.
* 2020 Halving: Resulted in a 620% increase in 11 months.

Based on some napkin math the BTC can reach a 162% price increase post-halving, with the peak expected around 420 days (14 months).

inb4 no one knows shit about anything. It's a probability game.

What's your take.

Some 20 years onwards, this entire article reads like a joke. 

>Getting the bits from dot-com to desktop requires still more  electricity. Cisco's 7500 series router, for example, keeps the Web hot  by routing an impressive 400 million bits per second, but to do that it  needs 1.5 kilowatts of power. The wireless Web draws even more power,  because its signals are broadcast in all directions, rather than being  tunneled down a wire or fiber

>Just fabricating all these digital boxes requires a tremendous amount of  electricity. The billion-dollar fabrication plants are packed with  furnaces, pumps, dryers and ion beams, all electrically driven. It takes  9 kilowatt-hours to etch circuits onto a square inch of silicon, and  about as much power to manufacture an entire PC (1,000 kilowatt-hours)as  it takes to run it for a year. And there are at least 300 of these factories in the U.S. Collectively,  fabs and their suppliers currently consume nearly 1% of the nation's  electric output.  
>  
>The global implications are enormous. Intel projects a billion people  on-line worldwide. That's $1 trillion in computer sales -- and another  $1 trillion investment in a hard-power backbone to supply electricity.  One billion PCs on the Web represent an electric demand equal to the  total capacity of the U.S. today.

Edit: Lmao @ the dumpster fire the comment section is, everyone shilling their premined scamcoins like Nano. Its hilarious seeing Nano paid shills/bag holders trying to compare Nano's recurring spam outage (that costs a trivial $ amount to attack) to BTC 2018, during which you could still send transactions without any problem whatsoever. **Considering the aggressive nature of the shilling in comments, I am forced to update the thread with what Nano actually is...**

Nano is a scam that was premined at the press of a button, distributed among themselves by Colin using funny faucets where the insiders themselves claimed most of the tokens, then abruptly the faucet was closed, the team now having control of most of the coins decided to pump it to yahoo land on a fraudulent exchange and ride into the sunset while also cashing out slowly for years. No wonder Nano price has never even recovered past its early 2018 ATH, after 4 years its still down a huge % from ATH. (thats what happened when you have an endless premine ready to dump on you). Nano peddlers are pushing this as a competitor to BTC lmao. A stablecoin like DAI or USDC on any ETH L2 solution renders Nano as useless. Which is why almost no one talks about Nano except their own bagholders who try to push it aggressively.

""Imagine a digital commodity-like currency that depends on no central authority or printing press; it being completely generated and managed by only the people.""

""It's called Bitcoin, an open-source MIT-licensed project created by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is cryptographically and collectively managed by voluntary nodes on the Bitcoin network. Coins are generated by CPU power and become harder to generate as it reaches its finite limit of 21 million coins. Right now a coin is worth around 6 cents, which fluctuates mostly with the cost of energy to generate them.""

And it got only 13 comments, top one being:

"" you have to waste electricity to make money. I find the idea rather stupid ... "".

https://www.statmuse.com/money/ask/bitcoin+price+2011

Looking at the price chart from 2011, back then price of 1 BTC was hovering at $13.16 on that particular day meaning just $100 would get you 7.6 BTC at the time. At current time of writing this, this would be worth about $211k right now. At the peak of Bitcoin back in 2021's bullrun, worth of that would be well over half a million USD.

 It's amazing that haters on there are longstanding users, hating for more than 10 years constantly on a thing like Bitcoin and crypto.

BTC,cryptocurrency,I think I finally understand bitcoin.,"It's a silent project that operates in the background. There's no face to it. The founders created it and walked away. It's like an elegant clock set into motion that continues to tick. There's no promise of some complex protocol to come 3, 5, or 10 years down the road. It does what it's supposed to now without self promotion from the founders. Since it doesn't need self promotion to thrive, it doesn't fall victim to the vices of marketing from greedy, charismatic leaders, with overly complex projects. Sure, there's Saylor and Novogratz that sometimes fall into that role. But bitcoin doesn't need them to survive and won't need them when they die. The project works now. It does what it's supposed to and it'll continue to do what it's supposed to. It's the money of the future of our science fiction novels.

There's no Krypto Kris marketing shitty debit cards. There's no charismatic Do Kwon doing a Forbes, Steve Jobs photo shoot with a black t-shirt and a white background. There's no J Powell magically expanding the money supply with a cobol fueled wand, creating a 9 trillion USD balance sheet out of thin air.

BTC takes out the corruption of humans, because the humans that created it stepped away. Sure, people will build corrupt systems around it, but BTC itself is a simple, pure, and elegant vehicle silently ticking away in the background until the ticking becomes so loud that no one can ignore it.",2283,2022-05-12 14:18:01,921

BTC,cryptocurrency,What happened to the $100k BTC by the end of the year prediction everyone was saying?,"A few months ago it seemed like everyone influential in crypto was predicting $100k BTC by the end of the year. However, it doesn't look like that's going to happen with the state of the market at the moment. It would take something absolutely miraculous to essentially double BTC's market cap by the end of the year. This confirms three things to me:

1.) It seems like many crypto investors, especially the influential onces are still way too optimistic and everything they say should be taken with a grain of salt. 

2.) The ""so called"" experts that keep being asked for predictions have no idea what they're talking about, just pulling random predictions out of their behind.

3.) Technical analysis in crypto can only tell you so much. Essentially, everybody (including the ""experts"") knows shit about fuck, and you're much better doing your own research than investing based on what these bozos say.

This is the reason why I generally feel bad for those ""two pizzas are now worth X millions"" posts, as if the people who traded BTC for goods in the old days could predict the future.

Reading those posts one would think their entire reserves is now in BTC.

But the fact is that just 2% of their reserves are even allocated in BTC. 

[El Salvador holds around $70m worth BTC](https://bitcointreasuries.net/). This is literally nothing for a country. They hold 1691 BTC, in comparison , Microstrategy and Tesla hold over 120,000 BTC  and 40,000 BTC respectively.

Less than 2% of their reserves are in BTC.

According to this article, they hold $79m worth GOLD, but just $70m 
worth BTC. 





People are spreading the false narrative as if he has moved the entire supply of reserves to BTC, which is far away from whats going on.
They have just been making small purchases over time. They literally bought like 2 BTC in the end of Dec. Peanuts for a country.


A 2% allocation in a risky asset class is not a gamble by any means. It is a decent risk reward play for individuals, and countries as well. 

If you consult with a financial advisor, they may suggest a portfolio allocation of 2% towards emerging asset classes like crypto. Infact, thats what Fidelity suggests as well. [Recently, they added a 2% BTC allocation to their flagship All in one Balanced / Growth funds](https://www.investmentexecutive.com/news/products/fidelity-to-add-bitcoin-exposure-to-portfolio-funds/). These are mom and pop funds that are held mostly by conservative investors. 

Its been around a year since El Salvador announced their Bitcoin Law and around 6 months since it went active. In this period, they have allocated a small portion of their reserves towards BTC. This is not a gamble, but a solid  and well planned asset allocation strategy. Meanwhile, they have already started mining BTC and over time, this industry has the potential to add to their GDP. 


What did people think bitcoin/crypto adoption would be like, one fine day every country across the world will just start accepting BTC out of the blue? Just like that it would become legal tender without any struggle? 

These are small steps and it will be risky. Nothing happened overnight, let alone moving from USD to a decentralised currency like Bitcoin.

Its shameful that people here want adoption of BTC and crypto, but the first time a large sovereign power has tried to adopt BTC, the same people who want crypto adoption go out of their way to attack them with baseless allegations.

Edit 3: The wallet currently has 0 BTC. At the same time, Elon Musk claimed that Tesla has sold 75% of its holding.

For those who do not know, ""Whale No. 3"" is a well-known holder of bitcoin and has gotten famous due to the sheer amount of BTC and anonymity. You can check out their holding here

That wallet currently holds over 117k BTC (valued at 2.6 billion USD). Nobody knows if this whale operates as an individual or an institution but it has been active for multiple market cycles.

Over the cycles, the whale has been rather accurate in the local tops and bottoms. During the summer lulls of 2021, it was accumulating. Then it started selling into Q4 of 2021. Some people keep 24/7 tabs on the whale's wallet activity using it as buy/sell signals. Sometimes the whale gets things wrong and loses (millions of USD ouch), but more often than not it gains huge.

This got me to thinking about the first time I heard of Bitcoin. I was a freshman in college and a computer science major. It was Fall of 2010. I was in the lab when a Sophomore csci major asked me if I wanted to help him set up the \~35 computers in the lab for mining Bitcoin.  His plan was to mine every night after classes ended until 8am when classes began again and 24 hours over the weekend.

Me, thinking it was a waste of time with Bitcoin being like $.06, said no. The guy ended up setting up the computers himself, mining \~2,000 BTC, and in 2013 when the price hit $1,000, sold half his stack to become a millionaire in college.

BTC,cryptocurrency,The Ethereum triple halving and why ETH will easily overtake BTC in marketcap,"&#x200B;

So, why do I make such a confident claim as to why Ethereum will easily surpass BTC as the largest cryptocurrency by almost every metric including market cap? Simply put, its because the Ethereum selling pressure is going to reduce by as much as 90% ‚Äì the equivalent of three Bitcoin halvenings in the span of 12 months. ETH will experience what is known as a triple halving, yes you read that right, a triple halving. To understand the triple halving of ETH we need to first understand what the BTC halving is:

* A Bitcoin halving event is when the reward for mining bitcoin transactions is cut in half.
* This event also cuts in half Bitcoin's inflation rate and the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation.
* It is widely thought that all previous halvenings are closely correlated to the initiation of bull market cycles leading to much higher prices than previous cycles.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ya4ccg2yuqh71.png?width=1070&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb05471edf3ba58045ef2534d2b377c4f5413c91

Ethereum will undergo a triple halving, or in other words, 50% \* 50% \* 50% = 12.5%, i.e. a 87.5% reduction in issuance which is the equivalent to 3 consecutive Bitcoin halving events. The upcoming Triple Halving will likely lead to a price explosion that I believe will allow ETH to easily overtake BTC in market cap. In this post I will discuss \*\*two\*\* key events that lead to the triple halving and why ETH will then easily overtake BTC as the most dominant crypto currency.

* The first event, and likely the least impactful of the two events will be caused by EIP-1559. On August 5th, EIP-1559 was passed, which means that 70% of the transaction fees in Ethereum will continually be burned. The more the network is used, the more fees will be burned. It is expected that with the deployment of EIP-1559, Ethereum would become net deflationary and stand at 2% negative annual issuance. In just one week over $100M of ETH was burned, this is insane. The drop in sell pressure represents a 30% reduction with the release of EIP-1559 which represent just over half of one BTC halving

https://preview.redd.it/cneo5zbzuqh71.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=636dc44bcedbadf71323f6e2ba73c5e23ced28f1

* The second (and very significant) cause would be the transition to Proof of Stake (POS) from Proof of Work (POW). To understand what this means we firstly need to understand Ethereum mining. As it stands, approximately 12,800 ETH (equivalent to $39,000,000) is rewarded to miners for running the Ethereum network and keeping it secure every day. Since ETH is still in a Proof of Work system most of this ETH is immediately dumped and sold into the market. Since the miners run a cash business, they need cash for electricity, equipment, paying investors etc. So everyday there is \*\*at least\*\* $39,000,000 worth of selling pressure for ETH each and every day. The implications for this transition means that ETH will go from a mine and dump economy (POW) to a stake and restake economy (POS). POS encourages saving as the more ETH you have the bigger your monetary benefit; this will not be for true all people as of course people will still sell a lot of ETH but most people will hold and restake their rewards as time goes by, enormously reducing sell pressure.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2y8ue7j0vqh71.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5767436475c53af3d23266a2edb01c4cfde5998

So now you know what the ETH triple halving will lead to ETH being deflationary and have a \~90% reduction in sell pressure, we will discuss why ETH will overtake BTC in market dominance. Firstly, price leads narrative. A narrative by itself potentially creates a price increase. A narrative with a significant price increase validates the narrative and induces a price explosion. The following events will convince any investor that ETH is ultra sound money:

1. Exploding active accounts and transaction volume
2. Low fees - The most significant problem with Ethereum is scalability and is about to be solved, once and for all. The Layer 2 deployment is in full swing and the transaction fees will come down in the future
3. Powerful DeFi & staking yields
4. An environmentally-friendly Ethereum 2.0. ETH 2.0 will require 99% less energy to run and this is required to break into mainstream adoption. This is an obstacle where BTC failed. BTC is currently using up 0.7% of the world‚Äôs electricity while only serving 50 million people and you would likely need to use 70% to serve 5B (Full global adoption). Climate protection is the number one agenda in many developed countries and simply for this reason is why BTC will never truly be able to become mainstream

Another likely scenario is sooner rather than later Elon Musk will ride the ETH bandwagon, the news of Elon Musk praising Ethereum‚Äôs soon upcoming launch of energy-friendly Ethereum 2.0 POS will be enough to propel ETH to 5 digits alone whether this is a good or bad thing is another debate in of itself.

Now, we must also take into account that all this will be happening when there is record demand for access to the Ethereum blockchain for DeFi and NFT's. ETH is simply too important relative to BTC. Ethereum has flipped Bitcoin in every important metric, the last remaining metric is the market cap and that is only one 2.5x of Ethereum away.

But now you may ask, isn't this narrative already priced in? Well no, I don't believe so. The Triple Halving narrative only came into existence on April 27th (A 79 page investment report on why ETH could hit $150,000 by 2023 can be found on this link [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing) ) how many of you had even heard of the ETH triple halving before reading this post? The average person will have no clue what even an Ethereum is but almost everyone has heard of BTC. In the last cycle the world discovered BTC not ETH, this cycle the world will discover ETH. BTC's first mover advantage will only take it so far and over time will begin to mean less and less. The shifting narrative of BTC to ETH will come as a result of BTC failing to be environmentally friendly and BTC will always fail at this hurdle as well as the very limited utility of BTC. Another reason why its unlikely this has been priced in yet is the Bitcoin halving was never priced in even though people knew about it 4 years in advance and it always led to a 100x price increase.

Now we must also discuss some major reasons why this laid out foundation for the price of ETH to explode could be hindered. The journey for ETH will not be straight forward by any means and will likely be plagued by delays and many other unforeseen events.

* Scaling could fail to reduce fees - Adoption can be too fast or Optimism is delayed or not adopted quickly enough by the main gas consumers (Uniswap and Tether).
* POS is delayed - This is ETH we are talking about and this scenario is very likely to happen. POS is scheduled for late 2021 but will more likely come in early 2022
* Transaction fees end up being so low that due to scaling or lack of usage (bear market) - If Ethereum scales too well, fee burns would not have such a big impact on price.

There are also some other issues that are less likely to occur such as a $10 Trillion market cap ETH could cause a regulatory risk as an unregulated decentralized entity being worth so much is a scary prospect for many governments to deal with.

TLDR: ETH is already beating BTC in almost every important metric except market cap, with the EIP-1559 update and upcoming transition to POS ETH will loses 90% of its sell pressure or the equivalent of three BTC halvings in the timespan of 12 months leading to a price explosion that some predict could hit $150,000 by 2023 ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing)).

BTC,cryptocurrency,13 years ago the lowest Bitcoin selling price ever was recored at $0.003 cents. 160 BTC were sold for literally 48 cents.,"We all know that Bitcoin was not always even nearly as high valued as today o even 5 years ago. There were even times when we had no real Bitcoin price chart and no way to actually now the current value of one Bitcoin, so the price was usually made by sell offers that went up for certain amounts. One of earliest ones happened on February 20th 2010.

On that date someone sold 160 BTC that he/she mined with just the use of 1 kWh energy, for the lowest price ever recorded at $0.003 cents as that person thought Bitcoin to be overvalued at 5 cents during that time. Now those 160 BTC would be worth $4M and at the ATH even $11M.

BTC,cryptocurrency,"A Balanced Portfolio Should Consist of at least 70% BTC, 60% ETH, 30% top 15 alts, 20% stables, and 10% low cap","I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of people post about adding BTC and ETH to their portfolio and asking questions how they should split up their portfolio. In this thread, I will share my experience on the perfect breakdown. 

To start, you want at least 70% in BTC. This is the granddaddy of all coins and your most stable. The higher the percentage of BTC, the better.

Next is ETH, I‚Äôve found 60% is a good level. Even if you just have BTC and ETH, you will have 130% of your portfolio in 2 coins, up for 100% you started with. To instantly have 30% more, you are genius. 

Next up is the large-cap alts. I like 30% here. You can LRDYOR (let Redditors do your own research) to decide which coin is best for you, but possible examples are SOL, ADA, DOT, LINK, AVAX, etc. Following advice up to this point, you have at least 160% portfolio. 

Keeping 20% stables is key to any portfolio. You can earn interest (up to 20%) on stables, plus any price action. I saw one tik-tok‚Äôer predict Tether would go to $5 this year. I think that‚Äôs bullish, but I can easily see USDT going to $3. Let‚Äôs say you earn 20% interest on your 20% investment, you now have 40% (compounding interest works wonders). Now your portfolio allocation is at 200% and you have doubled your money. 

Now that you have doubled your money, going for 100% portfolio allocation to 200%, you have freedom to gamble on low cap coins. I‚Äôd keep this to 10%. 

This strategy will work for everyone. It will instantly turn you into a billionaire overnight. Follow me for more financial advice.",2590,2022-03-02 12:21:05,959

After fucking up so epicly in the last 2 months, its atleast encouraging to see them do a test transaction of 0.01 BTC..

It looks like a big liquidation is underway in Celsius and they may also be declaring bankruptcy and announcing insolvency proceedings soon

DeFiyst has been tracking every move!

**Update: the $500m BTC is still in Celsius' main wallet here and hasnt yet been moved to FTX:**  https://etherscan.io/address/0x019C4935ff1c4945f046c6784c08a40f1ab632a3

They haven't yet moved this stack of 24.4k BTC to the FTX wallet. Since they moved the test 0.001 BTC, its speculated that they may move this too shortly.

If you check the wallet's erc20 txn tab, you can see that they have moved a lot of their tokens like ZRX, BNT, Comp etc to their main FTX wallet, probably to sell it. 

Now the wallet mainly has 24,400 wBTC ($511,000,000) + some Comp worth 50k

The wBTC just moved...  https://etherscan.io/tx/0x84a4bd54e9ce7d322544a0a8110232b37eb3bb4b1a486835891b6213a43fda56

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=RvF30Mz2IZW63s1mjjau2Q==

Lawsuit claims:

> After seeing these (and other) major problems in how the company operated, we informed Celsius that we wished to terminate our relationship. That was March 2021. We told Celsius that we would work with them to unwind our various positions over the following months.

Oof Celsius never hedged IL from their defi activities. They may have been insolvent long ago

> ""Faced with a liquidity crisis, Celsius began to offer double-digit interest rates in order to lure new depositors, whose funds were used to repay earlier depositors and creditors.""

> 91. After Stone left Celsius KeyFi, Celsius maintained access and control of the 0xb1 wallet. Celsius‚Äô CEO, Alex Mashinsky, used that control for his own personal benefit.

BTC,cryptocurrency,I think BTC is playing dead so the bears go away.,"Ever since i heard that we might be in a bear market i did some research on bears and bear attacks.

It seems to me like BTC is utilizing this technique to avoid the grizzly bears. Its playing dead by ranging in the 30s and once in a while makes a pump as a way to fight back against the black bears.

BTC,cryptocurrency,Why regret doesn't make sense and how I spent 10 BTC on minecraft diamonds,"Backstory: I bought ten bitcoin when they were $3 each. I spent them about a week later for diamonds in a minecraft server.

Now, you might be wondering why I wouldn't regret spending what is now worth half a million dollars on fake rocks in a videogame, but the more I've thought about the more I've realized:

- At $3 bitcoin still felt like a fun experiment. I had NO idea what I had. 
- More importantly, let's say I kept those coins. When Bitcoin hit $20 I would have been tempted to sell. When it hit $100 I would have been verrry tempted to sell. $1,000? I'd cash out for sure. There are so many milestones where I and many of us thought it was topping out where I without question would have so;d, especially in the early years. The likelihood of me keeping those coins for a decade with the assumption that today's prices were even possible at all is extremely unlikely. 

So ultimately don't beat yourself up if you sold some coins for lower prices than we see today. You made a decision that was probably right for whenever you made it.",4635,2021-03-25 11:07:58,641

BTC,cryptocurrency,"TIL This man has 7,002 BTC in a password-protected hard drive and lost the password to it. He has 2 tries left before the hard drive encrypts itself and the BTC is lost forever.","So, I was browsing around the web the other day and came across this story of a man named Stefan Thomas. He is a programmer who got paid 7,002 BTC in 2011 to make an animated video explaining what BTC was to the general public. Then, he stored the BTC in a digital wallet and the private keys to this digital wallet in an IronKey hard drive. The crux of the matter is that this IronKey hard drive is password-protected and he has lost the paper where he put the password on. This hard drive allows the user to have 10 guesses for the password before seizing the contents and encrypting itself, making it inaccessible to anyone forever. He has since tried to guess the password 8 times, which leaves him with only 2 tries left. At today's price, the 7,002 BTC is worth **$206 million**. 

And he is not alone. According to Chainalysis in 2022, they have estimated that there appears to be 3.7 million BTC (about 17.6% of BTC max supply) lost or in stranded wallets. Many of these people probably either lost their hard drives or lost access to it.  This is one of the realities of self-custody in crypto.

How are you guys securing your hardware wallets and have you made sure that you can access it at all times? Do you have any contingency plans in case you ever lose access to your seed phrases?

BTC,cryptocurrency,"In December NFL offensive tackle, Russell Okung, asked for half of his salary in BTC. That half is now worth more than his entire salary.","Okung asked for half of his $13 million contract for 2020 to be paid in Bitcoin, and the Carolina Panthers were able to make it happen. Here‚Äôs some quotes from the article. Sauce at the bottom. 

‚ÄúIf we are looking at where Bitcoin is at now, Okung could be considered one of the highest salaried NFL players at this moment.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor instance, when BTC hit $44k, the half of his contract that is paid in BTC climbed to $10.59 million, at $56k+ his half turned into more than his entire quoted salary. As far as 2020 NFL salary stats are concerned, Okung has entered the top five position. However, the NFL has recently decided to cap the league‚Äôs salaries at $180 million and a ball player‚Äôs contract could change in 2021. Because the Carolina Panthers‚Äô offensive tackle (OT) gets half of his salary in BTC, many proponents think of him as the highest-paid player in the NFL and not just ahead of the highest-paid OTs.‚Äù

‚ÄúMoney is more than currency; it‚Äôs power,‚Äù said Okung in a statement. ‚ÄúThe way money is handled from creation to dissemination is part of that power. Getting paid in bitcoin is the first step of opting out of the corrupt, manipulated economy we all inhabit.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkung went further into that statement adding: ‚ÄòWhen we are all paid in bitcoin, no one can tell us what to do with the value we create ‚Ä¶ In a post-fiat world, you won‚Äôt have to worry about your labor and time being stolen.‚Äù

Why weren't those guys convinced that BTC is something really valuable and that it has a huge chance of returning to all time highs and above?  Why do you have to see it pump like crazy in order for you to actually believe it? Where were you last bull run? Didn't you take notes? 

Sure, go ahead, yolo all in now, a bit to late, however 40k can be easily the next bull run's absolute bottom. So you still have some headroom for good winnings. But just don't come here at 60 or 70k asking the same question. Yes it will be too late.",927,2023-12-06 01:17:54,500

BTC,cryptocurrency,Which is better: Buying Top Coins vs. Buying BTC & ETH - (a 6 years DCA case study),"Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oen5zp/bought_top_20_coins_100_each_will_update_in_an/), I built a script to analyse if you DCA'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in BTC & ETH vs investing only in BTC since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. Here are the results.

**Numbers & assumptions:**

* DCAing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from Jan 1st 2015 and until July 6th 2021.
* Investments budget per week is $100.
* The weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.
* This case study is ignoring stable coin investments. E.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.
* The analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.
* Total invested money over the whole DCA period is $31,300.
* Transaction fees are not included in the analysis.

**Here are the results:**

* If you blindly DCA into the top 1 coins (BTC), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.
* If you blindly DCA into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (BTC, XRP, LTC, ETH) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.
* If you blindly DCA into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**
* If you blindly DCA into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**
* If you blindly DCA into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**
* If you blindly DCA into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**
* If you blindly DCA into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**
* If you blindly DCA into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**
* If you had a glass ball and knew that ETH will be what it's today and you invested only in BTC & ETH, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**

**Some observations:**

1. Although it was relatively easier to guess that BTC will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that ETH will be #2, so betting on BTC & ETH only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are God). Based on that it's safer to say ""I invest in the top X coins"" instead of saying I only invest in coin X and coin Y.
2. Investing in altcoins in addition to BTC can increase your ROI considerably. Investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).
3. Based on #2, a crypto ETF (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top X coins while saving transaction costs considerably.

If you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:

BTC,cryptocurrency,"We are 1-2 bad news away from complete collapse of Crypto market (BTC below $10K, ETH below $1k) so exercise EXTREME CAUTION. It's likely going to be a much longer recovery than March 2020.","Disclaimer: This is a financial advice but I am not a certified financial advisor. I just happened to be in crypto market since 2013.

Before we dive into the why of the message above, here are the kind of things everyone needs to be EXTREMELY CAREFUL about:

1. A lot of YouTube scammers and spammers are going to tout ""buy the dip"", ""capitulation"", ""steal deals"" and so on - do not fall for it. Doing your own research is more important than ever
2. Doing your own research wouldn't do much in this environment - markets are in a tricky situation, globally, a very bad one.
3. Many projects will see MASSIVE corrections and many would not survive so be even more careful.

So, with that aside, let's dive in a bit more.

A significant downside risk still persists in the market and if (god forbid) another 1-2 bad news hit the market, we may end up seeing that downside - it may mean a <$10K BTC and <$1K ETH. Terra is already down 90% with its own bad news and market will not be nice to any assets if bad news keep hitting. Right now, likelihood of bad news is more than the good news. Russia-Ukraine situation can escalate beyond the two countries, China real estate is a ticking bomb, China lockdown may extend further, another major covid variant can set things really back etc.

The V-shape recovery from this crash is highly unlikely, no major stimulus plan is waiting this market crash at the end of the tunnel, this market crash is good for the government because it will tame down the inflation. So don't try to outsmart the market with short term trades.

All in all, don't fall for shitty and shady YouTubers and Crypto influencers on Twitter - nobody understands the market and macro signals are more geared towards downside risk than upside optimism.

BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS IN EXECUTING ANY TRADE!

Good news - this shall pass too and we will emerge stronger with a bigger crypto market (shooting to $5-10T) but have patience and wait and watch.

God bless us all!",1578,2022-05-11 04:50:03,1284

BTC,cryptocurrency,"If everyone in just this sub withdrew 0.43 BTC from an exchange, the exchanges would run out of BTC","Completely a hypothetical thought experiment here, but...

When BTC was first created, there were no exchanges. They were all in self-custody. Once exchanges popped up, BTC migrated to them until they reached enough BTC that they could serve their purpose: allowing for billions of dollars of trading volume per day. Ever since 2020, the balance of BTC has slowly been leaving exchanges.

https://preview.redd.it/19vy5bke6ir91.png?width=2060&format=png&auto=webp&s=f87817cff8e905629be829d27ec869cbfeb8b4a2

This is a good trend, the less BTC on exchanges, the better, and the more the supply shock will be able to cause the price to go up, and the less the exchanges are able to artificially inflate the supply with fractional reserves.

There is currently 2.4 million BTC left in exchange balances. There are 5.5 million people in this sub. If every one of us in just this subreddit withdrew 0.43 BTC (on avg) from an exchange, they would run out of Bitcoin. If you deposit your BTC onto exchanges, you are literally giving it to them. Instead, hold onto it and make them BUY it from you in the future at a premium. The supply is limited and no one can make more.

Taking the BTC you own off of an exchange and into cold storage/self-custody is one of the best things you can do to strengthen the network and add value to it.

If you haven't done it yet, I strongly urge you. It's much easier than you think, it takes a few minutes, and it can be very rewarding. Self-custody can give a sense of peace knowing that no matter what happens in the world you will be able to have complete control of your BTC.",1527,2022-10-03 02:44:11,682

You will therefore no longer be able to replicate what I did this morning.

&#x200B;

**Original post from this morning:**

I was shook by this post here and had to immediately check if it's true: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pnsiq6/a\_big\_chunk\_of\_bitcoin\_is\_being\_moved\_around\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pnsiq6/a_big_chunk_of_bitcoin_is_being_moved_around_at/) (the OP has since edited in my post).

So apparently, the 45'000 BTC do not belong to FTX anymore and they're slowly being peeled. As per the statement of FTX's CEO ([https://twitter.com/SBF\_FTX/status/1437460791188467712?s=19](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1437460791188467712?s=19)), all should be well.

Now here comes my proof that the 45'000 BTC are still in full custody of FTX and nobody should be concerned (I know I was!)

I just withdrew 0.01 BTC from FTX as you can see in this transaction:

&#x200B;

[0.01 BTC withdrawal from FTX](https://preview.redd.it/hw5scjt7rfn71.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc65fdb1f01e461d50b4baf4f8e122d9ee46213e)

And here is the transaction to my Wallet on chain: [https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/10c57fe4b8449c8353e74c04b6954782245c1a6b0ea3f9515b51f7515262567d?from=ftx](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/10c57fe4b8449c8353e74c04b6954782245c1a6b0ea3f9515b51f7515262567d?from=ftx)

It shows I received the 0.01 BTC from the 45'000 BTC moving stack. Therefore, the funds are 100% still in control of FTX.

If you're a knowledgeable trader and can time the tops and bottoms with some degree of accuracy then this obviously doesn't apply to you.

If you're in this for the long haul, the fundamentals haven't changed. 

* There will still only ever be 21M BTC and in macro terms, it has historically only ever gone up.
* ETH is still a monumental leap in technology and going to start burning supply from July onwards when EIP-1559 is implemented in the London fork
* all the other promising projects are doing incredible things
* Fiat currencies are still going to see massive inflation from all the printing going on
* Bitcoin [has died 421 times](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/)
* China has banned bitcoin in every bull run to date
* Institutional adoption is only just beginning, we're still reporting every new company that is accepting it or holding it on their balance sheet
* You're still really really really early. Think of it in terms of internet adoption: How many people in your circles are into crypto vs how many of them are on Facebook, and how long did it take from the dawn of internet to reach that stage?

**The price going down is a blessing not a curse because it's so much cheaper!**

If you buy when it's red and sell when it's green, history tells us that you'll likely profit generously.

If you couldn't time the top then you probably can't time the bottom, and you probably won't be able to in the next couple of years, so why are you scared of getting a massive 50% discount?

Stop being an idiot and think a bit ffs. You need an emergency fund. And if you live in a Western country, a couple of 100$ isn't gonna cut it.

It may look like a genius idea now to go all in into BTC or any other crypto but that's because it's been pumping lately. Anyone who's been in the market for a while will tell you the dips and corrections can be brutal. The market shows no pity. If you see your life savings evaporate, or worse, if you did the supreme stupidity of loaning money to buy crypto, the market doesn't give a fuck.

How many more times do we have to say it? How many more sob stories need to happen before people will understand: *do not invest money you can't afford to lose. Do not invest your life savings and do not take loans to buy crypto*

Don't be stupid come on.",743,2023-10-30 19:02:06,633
BTC,cryptocurrency,The Luna Foundation moved all their BTC after UST lost it's peg,"After UST lost it's peg and briefly dropped to 0.92, it appears they are desperately trying to recover.

They just transferred all their BTC out of their wallet, probably going to dump it on the market in order to try to save UST.

Good luck to everyone who put money in UST. It will probably recover this time around because they got the BTC to sell or lend, but this just proves that UST isn't the great stablecoin that this sub portraits it at.

Be careful with UST going forward, this definitely won't be the last time that it's briefly losing it's peg and one day it might not recover.

BTC,cryptocurrency,BTC fell below 29k - all you need to know [SERIOUS][NO MOONS],"*Disclaimer  for the feds: I never   owned any crypto, never traded any crypto,  never made any profit and   this post is purely for entertaining purpose  only. This is not a   financial advice.*

**Introduction**

In this post I want to give you a quick, simplified & short summary of why exactly it dropped and whether the drop matters.

# BTC drop below 29k - a 1.5 Billion OI flush in minutes

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qeq8023boydb1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=957159e212231d0350a20b7a14b3c724d2df12b0

Taking a look at the chart it's  pretty clear what exactly happened. A heavy spot sell off ignited a  larger liquidation cascade wiping out over 1.5Bn Open interest,  Liquidated \~$9 Million USD all in minutes.

The spot CVD suggest a continouing sell off. In the meantime, the open interest spiked back.

# Degen Money as a major driver

&#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ns60775coydb1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=228c87b22cd4c64da14e3ce51dbefea10b56fb9d)

Interesting to look at is the quick  open interest reversal suggesting a lot of leverage entering the markets  with an unstoppable trend. **Right now the Open interest is 200 million higher than before the dump.**  Shorts are covering, bounces happen. Looking at fundings it's pretty clear that a lot of longs got wiped out  but also many shorts entered the market. The entire structure suggest  that after the move tons of positions were opened betting on both  directions - **expect more volatility to come.**

# Who is selling?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x3fy2gcdoydb1.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e9266d60c31074de5a640617c828f61418753f9

It's widely known that Coinbase is  used by institutions to handle their Bitcoin investments. So whenever I  want to find out who's selling I pay attention to the Coinbase CVD &  look for divergence compared to the aggregated CVD.

And it does say a lot! The CVD since the dump is on a steady rise suggesting a heavy selling into limit orders. **This  is most likely caused by Coinbase providing liquidity / market make at  current price for a larger entity cashing out thousands of BTC.**

Also  interesting & visible to look at considering the outstanding high  volume at $28,900 suggesting strong support & bidding against the  sell off

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/om6uhqfeoydb1.png?width=2549&format=png&auto=webp&s=96963956c061f6c9397b8798026b68ea81275ced

# AND WHY?

Honestly?  Because Crypto is being Crypto. In fact, this is just normal volatility  in my book. I know we all had a very calm crabbing over the last months  and BTC rarely moved drastically into a direction without bigger news  hitting the market. But looking back in time towards 2018-2021 this  volatility was just an every day scenario for Crypto.

**So... they sell for no reason?**

No  but it's just a normal market behavior of a larger player most likely  lowering their risk exposure with the upcoming week. There are important  macro events ( PCE, more earnings, FOMC 25 BPS rate hike... ) this week  so it doesn't suprise me to see profit taking happening ahead.

BTC  broke below the range lows & it's a normal market psychological  reaction to see it as a sell signal.  At the end of the day price is  driven by supply & demand so always expect high volatility being a  posibility independenlty from news

If  you are interested to look what the future speculative value brings to  the market feel free to look up  the obvious contenders for new  directional signal include:

\-  US equity market ( Tech was close to ATH and bad earnings might fuel a  further correction which might have a risk off reaction in crypto )

\- further development of regulations ( example clarity around Binance & DOJ but also other security related topics )

\- Grayscale Bitcoin fund court ruling

\- macro releases ( PCE, FOMC, GDP, Jobless claims just this week ) / economic correlations

\- ARK ETF

BTC,cryptocurrency,"The longer I'm in crypto, the more of a BTC maxi I become.","Don't get me wrong, I'm a slut for some altcoins. There's some that I am very excited about and could see or are doing great things.

But there's one big problem with each of these altcoins: you can't fully trust them anymore. Stuff like the recent crypto dot com ordeal, SOL, and the constant rugpulls. It's becoming more clear that you can't trust a project. There is always the thought in the back of my mind now that the developers could one day pull a CDC and just fuck over their investors. Neglect the attention ot to cover all their bases. Or just say fuck it and dip out.

The only project I seem to fully trust is Bitcoin now. I'm not worried about the developers deciding, ""oh, we're actually going to make the max supply 100m now instead of 21m."" Everything is set. It's all Gucci. 

Will I only invest in BTC now? Heck nah. I'll still keep my eyes peeled and sink some beer money into alts. But now I will be extra, extra careful. Chasing gains is over. I'm only interested in things I can trust for now on. CDC taught me a lesson. So thanks for that, I guess.

BTC,cryptocurrency,How to use ETH and BTC to become wealthy,"Yes, you read that title right. I'm going to share with you what it takes to become wealthy using just the top two large cap crypto. This might seem absurd compared to the 100x magic bullet micro cap coins that everyone else digs up.

*Niceee. Finally someone made a go to guide that is gonna get us lambos.*

Uhh.. Not quite. You see lets define **WEALTHY** and see how it is different from the word **Rich.**

[Ahem, yeah we know how to google and english man, stop messing with us](https://preview.redd.it/wn29xvvhby581.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=53ad7fbddde9764030f33de95f24f292a3611854)

Alright lets just compare rich versus wealthy. Then you might be enlightened:

[Assorted collection of article headings from countless websites explaining the difference](https://preview.redd.it/8pf36i0lcy581.png?width=1016&format=png&auto=webp&s=b777b34aa5147772aa7f0f7042f4eb2cefef93cf)

Basically, the **rich have a large sum of money while the wealthy are able to generate enough money to always be rich.**

My goal with this method of investment is to ensure that following it, we end up with enough investment that we are able to generate wealth passively that is enough to aid or even sustain living comfortably.

*Okay... Spill the beans, what do we need to do ?*

This stratergy requires you to put in three things:

1. Time
2. Money
3. Effort and Perseverance

*-ROLLS EYES- Yeah if we had money to throw around we would have been rich in the first place. What troll is this ?*

Not quite. What I am proposing is a simple yet effective stratergy that we have heard a bazillion times on this subreddit. And that is **DCA !!!**

*Oh F Off man, downvote, report. Ban this guy from this sub*

Wait wait, let me explain it in detail. This is worth your time.

Consider getting a 10 percent average year on year growth in the price of an asset. This means if it costs 100$ to buy today, then next year it will cost 110$, and the year after that it will cost 121$ and so on. So what we are going to do is invest in a periodic manner into this asset so that over the course of multiple years our investments grows substantially. How substantially ? It might blow your mind

[Ignore the Indian Rupee, the calculation is independent of the currency and only dependent on the amount](https://preview.redd.it/v14fcuztey581.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a88304dd2cffadef7d299668dbdce2038fac94f)

Imagine putting in 500$ a month for the next 10 years

When the 10 years have come, you would have invested i.e spent out of your pocket **60,000$**

But when you are going to cash out, you have over **100,00$** at your disposal. So you have made a profit of **43,000$** which is a 71 percent profit

*Pffftt... 71 percent. Those are rookie numbers.*

But wait a minute, we considered a 10 percent year on year growth right ? That means that if ETH today costs 4000$ then it must cost no more than 4400$ next year to be 10 percent growth.... LOL you think thats the potential of ETH or BTC ? We have seen so much movement within the last few months that over the course of multiple years or a bear and bull cycle, we can easily have a positive outlook. Thats the beauty of this method. Lets just put in a quick 15 percent optimistic rise. A little dirty mind math says we can expect to double the price of ETH within 6 or 7 years. Then.....

[Interesting isn't it ?](https://preview.redd.it/wsh0ko0xgy581.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=36b929fc5efbb41abbc59c6ebcc470a848c745f7)

Your investment amount for 10 years still is the same at 60,000$ but your profits went from \~43,000$ to \~**80,000$ which is almost doubling.** Again a 15 percent year on year growth might still be conservative. Punching a 20 percent just to see the madness unfold

[Voila](https://preview.redd.it/fysnp63ahy581.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=401a475920cfd357c68ed29359683e6f942c26f5)

Your profits are **200 percent of your investment. ie you have tripled the amount of money you have put into crypto.**

Now of course, there is one more thing that I haven't told you guys and that is **step up** in investment as well. Over the course of ten years, it is likely that your fiat paying job will progress and you can afford to invest more as the years go by. This is the ""stepping up"" of your monthly investment. Lets say for the first 12 months you do 500$ a month and then then next 12 months at 550$ dollars a month which means every year, you are increasing your monthly investment amount by 10 percent. Adding that into the calculation we can have the hopium overdose of...

[2.5X your intial investment by just blindly throwing money at the top 2 crytpo with no other plans or chart looking or anything](https://preview.redd.it/xns4em44iy581.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=86967afe6d00c0e9ce8b2c28aef5951a35a2bef2)

This also ignores other key aspects where you can further increase the returns. Buying ETH means you can stake them for even more returns **BUT those returns are in ETH itself which increases in price. This compounds things so much that I am unable to find an online calculator (LOL)**

So I hope I have convinced you on why DCA or SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) is a much more easy and much less risky than the concept of just chasing the next micro cap shilling and scams.

BUT, as with the case, there are caveats. My recommendation for ETH and BTC are the follows:

1. BTC is the OG and will always be a part of institutional investment.
2. ETH is the largest platform as a crypto that exists today. Years of development and countless projects have made it the largest to the point where we can safely assume it will be the baseline standard for years to come.
3. Compared to a lot of cyrpto celebrity, Vitalik Buterin, the co founder of ETH is much more of a good person who has a good track record of being on the morally right side. Yes their track record of delivering updates has been sub par to put it mildly. But the team are working hard led by a man who is as much a nerd as we are and I genuinely believe he wants ETH to succeed to make the world a better place.
4. Competition for ETH in the form of other coins have been growing and is ever present. But they also are facing their fair share of troubles and issues. Apart from marketing, nothing can claim to be an ETH killer.

And more importantly about the things that we put in:

1. The MONEY part. Yes there is no beating around the bush with it. Invest what you can. Rather than dreaming of what you could put in, put in what you have right now.
2. The TIME part. Yes this is a long term plan that indeed makes you wealthy. You'll have a decent chunk of money by the end of the SIP that you can use to it buy a house, buy something that makes you happy
3. The EFFORT and PERSEVERANCE part. You need to be patient for this to pay off. Unless you definitely need the money, try sticking to investing the amount you planned. Persevere and it will pay off definitely.

This is just my own 2 cents about how I plan to try and retire in the next 15 years. I wanted to share with you guys to show that it really is possible. Thank you if you read till here and gave this idea a thought. But, if you scrolled till here, then TLDR is **DCA FOR TEN YEARS !!!!!!**

I'll be making a follow up post on what I plan to do when I cash into the DCA. If there is anything I missed or is wrong, let me know in the comments and I'll put those into the post and the next one. Share your thoughts too :)",1459,2021-12-16 19:56:54,1029

Foreigners who come to invest in crypto in El Salvador will be granted permanent residency and will not have to pay taxes for the crypto they invest in.

BTC,cryptocurrency,Thieves Steal More Than 150 BTC From Joplin Bitcoin ATM,"**JOPLIN, MO.** \- Two thieves ripped open a Bitcoin ATM this past weekend outside a Joplin Circle-K and made off with about 153 bitcoins (BTC) according to the Joplin Police Department.

The heist took place about 6 a.m. Sunday at 4420 N. 45th St.

An eye-witness reported seeing two men backing up to the Bitcoin ATM with their car and ripping the front of the machine open with crowbars.

‚Äú*It only took them about two minutes,*‚Äù said Jeb Moons, who said he heard the thieves screaming ‚Äú*gotta get those tendies!*‚Äù and ‚Äú*diamond hands bitches*!‚Äù as they poured the loose BTC into their backpacks.

Moons said the men were dressed in black with the hoods of their sweatshirts pulled up and their faces covered. He also reported that both sweatshirts had the letters ‚ÄúWSB‚Äù on them with a image of a baby wearing sunglasses.

‚Äú*There was literally bitcoin everywhere, it was like witnessing a real-life double-top!*‚Äù said Laura Latoshi, who also remarked that she saw people rush the ATM and start grabbing as much bitcoin as they could carry. ‚Äú*If you ask me, they are just a bunch of paper-handed bitches who obviously panicked during the last market dip and sold low.*‚Äù

The car ‚Äî a 2021 Tesla Model S Plaid ‚Äî was subsequently spotted by employees working the Joplin AMC Theatre later the same day. ‚Äú*I guess they bought high and sold low and are looking for a way to buy some Lambos.*‚Äù said Frank Etherman, an AMC box office employee.

A member of the popular subreddit, *CryptoCurrency*, estimated the theft was worth roughly $6,900,420.00. Police are asking anyone with information to post on r/CryptoCurrency.

&#x200B;

Make no mistake, they are taking advantage of a pump, and their team of analysts (best guess) probably decided today would be a good day to sell some. This is a textbook example of a DCA sell order. 

&#x200B;

If you go deep into their purchase and sell history, they regularly sell when there's a pump and regularly buy when there's a dump. Only once have they been ""hurt"" by the decision to sell (that was in Jan and Feb '21 when BTC was going wild breaking through 30k and 40k in 10 days). Apart from that, they predict dumps and weekly ATHs spot on. sells in increments of 1500 BTC (3k or 6k if he predicts a larger dump).

BTC,cryptocurrency,Shockingly the US government still has 41.5k BTC ($1B) to sell before this year ends in three months. Be ready for some real volatility.,"I think many may still vaguely remember the event of early this year, where the US government suddenly sold about 10k BTC on the market. There was quite some doom and gloom around it, until it got clear that the BTC were just part of their Silk Road sizing, later it was also revealed that the US would pledge to sell the remaining 41.5k BTC from the seizing in this current year.

And while there have been quite many false alarms spreading FUD in the previous months about a US government sale, the blockchain data shows that there is yet some sizable sale to be made by the US government.¬†

Here we can see how the US government is still sitting on their $1B worth of BTC that are yet to be sold and that in just the remaining 3 months. A $1B sell pressure that only has three months left to drop on the market, there will indeed be quite some FUD around this in the coming weeks‚Ä¶

Initially the thought was that the US government would be smart enough to split this over the whole year and there would literally be zero effect on the market prices, but now it seems like they have not taken the SEC classes about market manipulation‚Ä¶¬†

Anyways, this will not be the end of the world as even a 41k BTC sale in just one day, which is unlikely, would be ""just"" about double the BTC trading volume. So if they go this extreme route there will be quite a considerable effect on the prices. Let's hope the US government actually knows their own laws and maybe even postpone those sales to next year.",685,2023-09-22 17:55:10,438

[This is how the default page of the faucet looked like.](https://imgur.com/gallery/HvnAZ2k)

To fuel the first faucet, Andresen loaded it with 1,100 BTC of his own. After these were given away, the faucet was reloaded, with early bitcoin miners and whales also donating coins.

Andresen said that: ‚ÄúBitcoins are a new kind of money, and that they aren‚Äôt created or controlled by a government like USD or EUR, they‚Äôre created and controlled by anybody who wants to be part of the Bitcoin payment network.‚Äù

This faucet managed to give away to people 19,700 Bitcoins which is now worth $1,171,852,530.

[Here is the Andresens original post about the faucet that he posted in June 11, 2010](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=183.0). I highly recommend you to read it. To imagine that someone gave him back 50 BTCs just because he felt bad for getting 5 for free is ridiculous now.

I thought it would be great idea to share this nice piece of history.

- Unlocks the potential for smart contracts
- Allows for privacy protected transactions 
- Lower transaction fees

Bitcoin will become a major DeFi player after this upgrade.

It is the first upgrade for the network since November 2017. Segregated Witness (SegWit) was deployed, and the network forked to create Bitcoin Cash.

The multiple signature part will enable more complex transactions like those used in smart contracts. Developers are already working on smart contracts for the Lightning Network which is Bitcoin‚Äôs layer 2 scaling solution.

BTC,cryptocurrency,Difficult to Beat BTC/ETH Portfolio,"I went back to the prices of altcoins (top 20 during those respective times.  Which means the top 20 list changed from A to D below) from 2017 to 2020 and to see how they faired against BTC/ETH.  There are different stages.

A.  2017-18 Altseason

Dec 3/2017 - present

1. BTC (11323 dollars -> 34218 dollars):  +202%
2. ETH (465 dollars -> 2261 dollars): +386%
3. Top 20 alts:  +51%

Dec 17/2017 - present

1. BTC (19140 dollars -> 34218 dollars):  +78%
2. ETH  (719 dollars -> 2261 dollars): +214%
3. Top 20 alts:  -32%

Dec 31/2017 - present

1. BTC (14156 dollars -> 34218 dollars): +141%
2. ETH (756 dollars -> 2261 dollars):  +199%
3. Top 20 alts:  -43%

Jan 14/2018 - present

1. BTC (13771 dollars -> 34218 dollars):  +148%
2. ETH  (1366 dollars -> 2261 dollars) : +65%
3. Top 20 alts:  -56%

&#x200B;

Basically, if you look at the 2017-18 Dec/Jan altseason, your alt portfolio (had you bought at the time and held til today) underperforms badly compared to BTC and ETH.  So in the long run, it would have been better off to just traded these alts or not buy any alts (on average) during this altseason frenzy.  Notice that a lot of the alt portfolio from Dec/Jan would still be in minus today.

Only ADA outperformed BTC (and ETH) amongst the top 20 alts.  But ADA wasn't that popular at the time and I doubt there would have been many alt portfolio that predominantly just had ADA.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

B.  Stagnant BTC summer of 2018

June 10/2018 - present

1. BTC (6499 dollars -> 34218 dollars):  +426%
2. ETH (500.45 dollars -> 2261 dollars): +351%
3. Top 20 alts:  +178%

June 24/2018 - present

1. BTC (6173 dollars -> 34218 dollars):  +454%
2. ETH (457 dollars -> 2261 dollars):  +394%
3. Top 20 alts:  +195%

&#x200B;

This was the summer times of 2018 when BTC had very low volatility and went back and forth from low 6K to high 6K.  Alts corrected big time and everyone declared that bull market was over.  Even during this time, it would have been better to buy BTC as opposed to alts.  And notably, BTC outperformed ETH during this time.

Some notable alt that emerged from this era was BNB.  If you had known BNB would taken off, you would have yielded around 1000-2000% gains from purchasing BNB here (it outperformed BTC/ETH).  But then again, not too many people went all in on BNB here.

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

C. Peak Bear Market of Winter 2018

Dec 9/2018 - present

1. BTC (3614 dollars -> 34218 dollars): +846%
2. ETH (95.14 dollars -> 2261 dollarss):  +2276%
3. Top 20 alts:  +963%

&#x200B;

Dec 23/2018 - present

1. BTC (3998 dollars -> 34218 dollars): +755%
2. ETH (130 dollars -> 2261 dollars): +1628%
3. Top 20 alts:  +723%

&#x200B;

This was the dreaded low point in 2018 that involved the BCH hash wars.  So this would have been the best time to buy the dip in retrospect.  For the first time, top 20 alt portfolio would have outperformed BTC.  But importantly, it would not have outperformed ETH.  So some BTC+ETH combination would have outperformed the alts again.

If you bought BNB and ADA here, you would have secured around +5000% profit.  But then, how would we have picked just these winners and nothing else?  Moreover, one thing to note is that ETC has performed relatively well through out all these phases.  But perhaps that is due to ETC being overpriced at the moment.

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

D. Recovery of 2019

May 19/2019 - present

1. BTC (8197 dollars -> 34218 dollars): +317%
2. ETH (261.29 dollars -> 2261 dollars): +765%
3. Top 20 alts: +243%

&#x200B;

June 23/2019 - present

1. BTC (10855 dollars -> 34218 dollars): +215%
2. ETH (307.83 dollars -> 2261 dollars):  +634%
3. Top 20 alts: +191%

&#x200B;

In mid 2019, BTC began its recovery with good news regarding crypto from China et al.  Unfortunately, even having a top 20 alt portfolio here would have lost out to some BTC/ETH portfolio.  The ongoing message is that it is very very difficult to outperform BTC+ETH.  You only win out if you pick just the winners but how do we know this without hindsight?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

In general, I would assume that 95+% of portfolios will not beat some BTC+ETH combination.  Regardless of whether you buy at the top, at the middle, at the bottom of the bull (or bear) market, purchasing BTC+ETH is better than some combinations of top 20 alts.  My own take is that if you do want to go for an all alt portfolio, you need to do very good research and only pick a couple of alts.  The more alts you have in your portfolio, the laws of average will dictate that you will almost guarantee to lose out to BTC/ETH portfolio.  For example,

\- BTC+ETH+ADA portfolio from 2018 would have been very good.

\- 100% BNB (line of reasoning: Binance will be king so BNB has massive room to move up) from 2018 would have been massive high risk/high reward move that would have paid off big time.

\- BTC+ETH+ADA+XRP+Nano+IOTA+OMG+ONT+QTUM would have been bad.  Too much diversification means you would rather go BTC+ETH.

And then everyone is like ""oh for sure 1 million by 2030""  Do these people also not think we will have a huge correction after the cycle is over like we always have had ? Curious on your reasoning if you think that way. I personally think 200k give or take 10k is the top or very close to it this cycle . Then I think back down to 60s before we go up the next cycle . Then around 500-700k next cycle. To me this seems realistic and still very bullish and  in line with allot of data I research. ",52,2024-07-03 19:15:32,144

BTC,CryptoMarkets,"Anticipating Flash Crash on Bitcoin - 62,200 to 35,000 - Ultimately 7,000 - This weekend / Early this week","Hi all, 

Unfortunately we cannot post images on this sub, however I wanted to inform you of my current Bitcoin trading plan since I‚Äôve dedicated many months into the prediction of this market event. 

I anticipate that Bitcoin will see a flash crash very soon, likely this weekend. 

The sequence of the drop per my own trading plan is as follows:

62,200 to 35,000

35,000 slight retrace up to 43,000 approximately 

43,000 to 7,000 - 10,000

Personally I am shorting Bitcoin and will not buy into long term holds or longs until Bitcoin drops near 10,000 or proves to me this idea is invalidated. 

I‚Äôve done a ton of work on this theory, can explain in great detail the why / how / when / and mechanics of it all. 

I will start this post here and update it as it progresses. 

This is not a doom scenario, my expectation is that Bitcoin sweeps these Uber lows and we will see a bull run over the next 1-2 years ultimately resulting in a 120k to 200k Bitcoin value. 

My opening trade stats are: 

Trade begins Saturday 1:00 pm 

Total margin in short $5,000 

Entry Price - 62,000

Stop Loss - (I do manual stop losses and know when I want to get out of a trade, when it‚Äôs not going the way I anticipate) ",0,2024-10-05 18:14:13,115

BTC,CryptoMarkets,1 week challenge: 0.1 Bitcoin to 1 Bitcoin,"Over the next 7 days I'm going to use just under 0.1 Bitcoin (0.0938) I have set aside from my portfolio to solely buy what El McAfee tells me to buy. It will be called the ""7 days of Christmas challenge"". Will post results in 7 days with a daily breakdown. 

I know hes a paid shill and I know they are all trash coins, I don't plan on holding any for more than a few minutes. I have absolutely nothing to do where I currently live so my plan is to leave his Twitter open while I play through Halo CE and borderlands 2. The moment he tweets some dribble and if it's on the exchange with my Bitcoin I'll buy immediately and sell after I'm happy with the profits. I'll compare to my main portfolio and see where it ends up.

Edit: after some math I realised I only need to make 39% profit on each trade to achieve this. Fun fact, using similar math and a well known calculation you only need 10 trades/cycles of 7.2% gains to double your money!

Edit 2: Added a name for this after lying in bed unable to sleep - The 7 days of Christmas challenge as it starts on Christmas day for me in Australia.

Edit 3: RIP inbox, away from home for Christmas so waking up on Christmas morning to so many comments albeit remind me in 1 week was pretty cool.

4: Day 1 was a failure, not on cryptopia like all the past ones. tried it with some money I had on bittrex but it truly seems bots have taken over and instantly cause connection issues when you go to that exchange pair....

Also thank you for the Reddit gold kind stranger, was a nice Christmas present :), this individual a long with 4 others have asked me to add a dogecoin address for future projects so I have. 

To be clear I am not asking for donations or money at all, anything donated will be stored and eventually donated to charity. If I actually get some donations to this address I'm thinking id run a poll for the community to vote to determine where the coins should be invested. After a year of hodling and perhaps several more polls to adjust the portfolio any money will be donated to charity. Again I have been asked to do this and replied to these people saying I don't want to look like I'm asking for money, I do however think this would be a cool idea to have a community run portfolio to give to needy causes.

After one of its worst crashes, it has bounced back and speculators and enthusiasts are all asking what the next ceiling is gonna be. Among the many speculations that have made rounds, the $138k one is one of the most convincing, at least to me.   
  
I read this [analysis](https://finbiteinsights.substack.com/p/bitcoins-next-all-time-high-at-138k) which suggests that based on past recoveries, we could anticipate a peak of $138k. Here's the breakdown: from the initial peak of $1,132 to the second peak of $19,141 represented approximately a 16x increase. Then, from the second peak of $19,141 to the fourth peak of $69,000 (as the third and fourth peaks were close), there was about a 3.6x increase. The trend indicates diminishing returns, which is expected as Bitcoin transitions into a 'mega cap'.  
  
If we extrapolate this pattern, we might anticipate a 1x increase from the previous peak. Therefore, we're potentially looking at $69k x 2 = $138k.  
  
I'm interested to hear your thoughts on this analysis.

BTC,CryptoMarkets,I feel like so many people messing around in the Crypto space don't have the faintest idea why Bitcoin was conceived in the first place and are therefore destined to fail. ,"So many of these memecoins bear absolutely no resemblance to the idea behind Bitcoin and are therefore clearly (IMHO) just ploys to siphon off people's fiat currency.

People are just looking to ride a pump and dump train and make a quick buck. That's got to be a losing game for 99% of people.

Bitcoin is the only Crypto I've ever invested in, but ironically, it's not supposed to be an investment. It doesn't have any inherent value outside of being an alternate currency to fiat.

Most other Cryptos, as far as I can see:

* Do not have limited supplies:
   * This means they ARE going to be inflationary in the long run. i.e. you shouldn't use them as a store of wealth. The value will go down as the supply increases. One of Bitcoin's core concepts was the idea that, because fiat currencies can be created at the whim of the central banks, the central banks essentially have the power over us all. Bitcoin is inherently DEFLATIONARY because it will have a limited supply. Forever.
* Are not actually anonymous (this includes Bitcoin if you trade it on an exchange):
   * If you're using an exchange that requires your ID to participate, your transactions are tracked just like the normal banking system. Again, this is totally contrary to the core principles of Bitcoin, that transactions are transparent to the market, and therefore cannot (in theory) be manipulated, but also cannot be traced to the individual, once again removing the power of the government over its citizens.

These two core principles are, again, the key reason why Bitcoin has gained so much value over the years. Because it appeared to be a legitimate, transparent alternative to fiat currency, that could be traded safely, and anonymously, so people bought it, to do just that. Opportunists saw the opportunity to make a quick buck from doing pump and dumps and an entirely new industry was formed off the back of it, which ignored the real reason for Bitcoin's initial ""success"". (I put ""success"" in inverted commas because it was never designed to be used as an investment vehicle.)

Eventually, people are going to catch wind of the fact that 99% of new coins are just scams. Ponzi schemes designed to part you from your money.

I would love for someone to convince me that other coins in the market ARE good investments, but it's going to take some convincing.

Anyway, rant over.",42,2024-08-24 20:32:04,69

BTC,CryptoMarkets,Are memecoins fully dependent on Bitcoin?,"

In this post I will discuss the effect of the Bitcoin price on the price of memecoins, how it is possible to get out of this endless price circle and whether memecoins can do 1000x or so, even when Bitcoin is down bad.

Bitcoin as the largest and most widely known cryptocurrency has an undeniable impact on all other altcoins, both memecoins and large altcoins like Ethereum and Solana. Fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin often change investor sentiment and can affect trading behaviour across the entire ecosystem, including memecoins.

Historical data suggests that memecoins frequently exhibit a high degree of correlation with Bitcoin. A nice proof of this can be seen in the last bullrun, when a number of memecoins reached several hundred million market cap, but once Bitcoin started to fall, many of them fell to almost zero

Despite this set trend, we can observe many memecoins that defy this rule and manage to grow even in the bearmarket (or beartrap we have seen in the last month) such as Pepe, Ponke or Yewif. But what's behind the success of these memecoins? I consider the biggest catalyst for success to be these memecoins communities along with the dev/admin team. Various features or conveniences of these tokens can also play an important role. As an example, BONK and his BONKbot, which is a buy bot on Telegram.

To sum it up, while it is evident that Bitcoin has an impact on altcoins, their level of dependence is influenced by a number of factors and it is important to note that if the right set of factors come together, memecoin can easily grow even when the rest of the market is down.

BTC,CryptoMarkets,Some advice to newer people about this Bitcoin rise,"Hello there people,

I just wanted to remind you all about the fact that you should stay rational right now. I understand that with Bitcoin rising towards 70k, one or the other might succumb to the feeling of FOMO. And please, I'm telling you: Don't fall for your emotions. Despite what everyone on the internet or the news might be telling you currently, Bitcoin is absolutely NOT guaranteed to head higher from here. We have been in a range for the past 7 months and it's possible that we keep doing that for another few months, who knows? Don't think that Bitcoin 100% has to start going ""because we are in Q4"" or some shit.

Especially the times where everyone is screaming that Bitcoin ""is breaking out!!!"" are the ones where most people get it wrong. We could also go below 50k again and I'm asking you: Are you prepared for that?

I'm not saying we will necessarily go there (though I personally do have my reasons to believe this), but if that scenario is not on your radar, then you shouldn't be in the markets. Don't overleverage yourself, and practice caution. Don't get hyper bullish and don't FOMO in. Be prepared for both cases, up and down, we are not out of the woods yet.",27,2024-10-21 18:54:34,41

Since March 21, the entity has acquired a total of 4,380 BTC, amounting to a staggering $282.38 million. These purchases were executed at an average price of $64,471 and were sourced from the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance.

BTC,CryptoMarkets,Closed My Bitcoin Position After 3 Months ‚Äì Need Your Thoughts!,"Hey everyone, I need some advice (or maybe just some reassurance üòÖ).

So, I held onto a Bitcoin position for **3 months** and finally decided to close it. The good news? I made a **$1,500 profit** (minus \~$400 in funding fees - yay!?) But here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîI was holding it with **6x leverage** the entire time. üò¨

Now, I know I came out alive, but I can‚Äôt help wondering‚Ä¶

* Was it a mistake to hold something for 3 months in Futures? I ended up paying $400 in funding fee.
* How many days do you generally keep your position?
* Any tips on managing leveraged positions better?

Honestly, the stress of holding it for so long with leverage was a bit *much*. Would love to hear your suggestions or similar stories. How do you all handle trades like this?",7,2024-10-21 03:48:23,36

Everyone speaks of these huge returns if meme coins really become a reality in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

I find all of this very interesting since if we look at Solana as an example, we can see multiple big projects such as dogwifhat, bonk, and jeo boden popping off in the couple weeks/months. Not to mention, there are also smaller ones with similar growth, which have reached the 1 million market cap (e.g., hege, maneki, and yewifhat).

BTC,CryptoMarkets,I analyzed the Last 3 Bitcoin halvings here's what I think will happen after the 2024 halving,"Hi

If you've never experienced a Bitcoin halving before, or if you have but are unsure what to expect, I've done a bit of research based on the last halvings. Here's what i have. 

The halving occurs every four years, cutting the reward for mining new blocks in half. The next halving will reduce rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.

Historical Price Impacts:

* 2012 Halving: Bitcoin's price surged approximately 9308% in 13 months.
* 2016 Halving: Saw a 2861% increase over 17 months.
* 2020 Halving: Resulted in a 620% increase in 11 months.

Based on some napkin math the BTC can reach a 162% price increase post-halving, with the peak expected around 420 days (14 months).

inb4 no one knows shit about anything. It's a probability game.

What's your take.

BTC,CryptoMarkets,I turned BlackRock Bitcoin ETF inflow into a trading view indicator. And it's flashing Short ,"Looks like this is the top. Finally turned black rocks Bitcoin ETF inflow volume into a trading view indicator. I say finally because it was notoriously hard to do. If you've ever tried to turn even the simplest thing into a trading view indicator using artificial intelligence either chatGPT or even Google's gemini or claude, nobody lets you. 

Anyways, this is important because way back when everyone was doing support and resistance analysis for binance, all those lines started breaking as soon as coinbase got more volume. So it became useless to chart on binance. So I started charting on coinbase and made a ton of money for years and now suddenly once again, my trend lines became useless. Bitcoin price would just ignore the trend lines and blast straight through them or just use them as fake outs and break through then dump down to hell. 

And then it finally hit me, Black Rock does 20 times more volume than coinbase or binance put together and nobody has a Bitcoin chart for Black Rock volume. 

So in spite of chat GPT giving me the runaround for months, I made one.

And the correlations it revealed are nothing less than money

BTC,CryptoMarkets,"Bullish Indicator Resurfaces as Bitcoin Stabilizes Above $60,000","A market cycle indicator for Bitcoin, which tracks investor sentiment phases, has recently flashed a bullish signal after previously turning bearish for the first time since January 2023, following Bitcoin's drop below $50,000.

On August 5, 2024, Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline to $49,751, known as ""Crypto Black Monday,"" marking the first drop below $50,000 since February.

This decline prompted the bull-bear cycle indicator to shift into the ""Bear"" or bearish zone. However, the indicator has since turned bullish again as Bitcoin managed to stabilize above $60,000.

According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin traded below the key $60,000 level until August 8, 2024. At the time of reporting, Bitcoin was priced at $60,732, reflecting a 0.35% decrease over the past week.

The last bearish signal from the Bitcoin bull-bear cycle indicator occurred in January 2023, shortly after the collapse of FTX. Additionally, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index recorded an ‚ÄúExtreme Fear‚Äù score of 17 on August 6, the lowest since the FTX crash. However, this score later rebounded to a ‚ÄúNeutral‚Äù level of 48.

Some Bitcoin traders believe this rapid price reversal suggests that the recent price drop might have been a bear trap‚Äîa situation where experienced traders deliberately sell Bitcoin to temporarily lower asset prices and trap short sellers.

On the other hand, analysts have differing views on Bitcoin's next market direction. On August 7, Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, suggested that Bitcoin's target price might fall into the low $40,000 range before the next bull market begins.

Conversely, a report from Cathie Wood‚Äôs Ark Invest on August 6 indicated that crucial support levels for Bitcoin are at $52,000 and $46,000.

Veteran trader Peter Brandt also noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs recent decline since the halving resembles the 2015-2017 bull market cycle, implying the potential for a subsequent bull run.

With the bull-bear cycle indicator now showing a bullish signal and Bitcoin‚Äôs price stabilizing above $60,000, there is optimism that the Bitcoin market might enter a sustained bullish phase, although analysts remain divided on short- and medium-term trends.

When I approached this world and read about some projects, I didn't choose bitcoin. I thought and I think it's an obsolete blockchain. My mistake was that I couldn't see it as a store of value. 

For that reason I built a small long term portfolio with my internship's earnings based on ETH, SOL, DOT mainly and 2 more ones. Obviously I'm not rich now. Observing the market during these years I have noticed that when BTC drops, all the altcoins do the same; and vice versa.

Hi, i have been on Bitcoin since 2016 probably not to soon but with the time to study and educate the moar i can from the crypto currency markets to make money, im still not rich and have been not easy, im just a guy trying to make it like all of the early btc or eth early guys.

*\*this isnt a investment advice and not should be taking as that\**

Go to your trading view accout and search for:

**BLX in a 6M chart or BTC/USD on Bitstamp 6M chart**

then

**TIA/USDT in a 3D chart.**

¬øDo you see the¬†**fractal**? They are¬†**similar**? you think is imposible, ok i will continue‚Ä¶

* *‚ÄúNO WAY BUT BTC IS THE FUTURE‚Äù*.

**SPX/USD in a 6M chart**

20, 13 and¬†**9**¬†years cycle.

I ask ¬ø**why this would not happen on bitcoin**¬†after¬†**15 years**¬†supercycle?

Other ex:¬†**COP/USD in a 6M chart**¬†if you are a¬†**forex guy**.

¬øIf this happend¬†**why can i do**¬†as a¬†**crypto bro**? in¬†**TradFi**¬†there is a concept called¬†**inverse correlation**, wen you refer to stocks or crypto the best assets tend to be bonds, fiat and gold but the gold run recently and¬†*seems*¬†*at a top*, bonds are not easy for retail and holding fiat a decade is a problem and its not worth the patience and the inflation, to much time for hold on fiat specially if you live from investments and dont have other incomes (my case) like real state or cashflow.

**1 theory**, crypto will develop few inverse correlation assets but before that more fundamentals.

Privacy will matter because people is going to be full controled with blockchain tech no matter if is goverment money or other crypto especially while AI tech start being used by goverments and regulators, not mentioning wen quantum computing arrive. BASED on all that i make myself the next questions.

¬øThere is a coin that¬†**have been contrarian**¬†**to btc**¬†trading cycle¬†**all this years**?¬†**Yes.**¬øThis¬†**coin**¬†is one of the¬†**most hated**?¬†**Yes.**¬øThis coin have¬†**win the regulators battle**?¬†**Yes.**¬øThis coin have a¬†**Grayscale ETF aproved**?¬†**Yes.**¬øThis coin have¬†**privacy**?¬†**Yes.**¬øThis coin have never experienced a bullmarket before?¬†**Yes.**

BTC,CryptoMarkets,November BTC Fork - The Facts,"**Update 2:** THE NOVEMBER SEGWIT2X HARDFORK HAS NOW BEEN CANCELLED! :D

**Update:** Thank you for your appreciation on this article. I decided to publish it on Medium. &nbsp;

[You can find the article on this link.](https://medium.com/@ross.p/with-less-than-a-dozen-days-left-before-the-segwit2x-fork-i-thought-id-start-gathering-some-facts-6386fe28d84f)

&nbsp;



**Existing Article:**

With less than a dozen days left before the SegWit2X fork, I thought I'd start gathering some facts before I start forming personal opinions and speculative conclusions. I refer to the SegWit1X chain as 1X and the SegWit2X chain as 2X for simplicity, and I have looked for very simple facts and safe assumptions. Here are the dots that I gathered: &nbsp; 


&nbsp;





‚Ä¢ Fork at Block **494,784**. Approximate time = **16th of November** - see Reference 6 for exact time. &nbsp;


&nbsp;




‚Ä¢ **The New York Agreement:** The NYA involved parties representing about 83% of the then hashing power who all agreed to both hardforks - one for SegWit and another for an increased block size of 2MB (2X) within 6 months of the former. Further details in reference 1. &nbsp;


&nbsp;




‚Ä¢ It is safe to assume that miners will only mine the most profitable chain (possibly several chains in differing proportions). &nbsp;

‚Ä¢ If whales pump a single chain it will gain more value. If this happens, miners will be more inclined to mine that particular chain only. This will result in the other chain(s)potentially losing overall mining attractiveness. &nbsp;


&nbsp;




‚Ä¢ **1X** will continue to have a 1MB block and SegWit; &nbsp;

‚Ä¢ **2X** will have a 2MB block and SegWit; &nbsp;

‚Ä¢ **Bitcoin Cash** (Just for info right now) currently has an 8 MB block with NO SegWit; &nbsp;


&nbsp;





‚Ä¢ **Current Price Status (Futures) on BitFinex:** 2X/BTC = 0.17; 1X/BTC = 0.83 &nbsp;


&nbsp;




‚Ä¢ **Current Mining Status:** 2X = Around 85% of blocks are signalling for 2X. &nbsp;

It seems only a few mining pools including Slush Pool, F2Pool and Kano CKPool are not signalling Segwit2X. All Antpool (Jihan Wu) owned pools are signalling for Segwit2X and will likely continue to do so up to the fork. It is not clear if any other pools from the Segwit2X signalling group will change their minds in the meantime. &nbsp;


&nbsp;




‚Ä¢ **Lower mining power chain:** Likely to be 1X. Fees likely to be extremely high as not many miners. Difficulty adjustment could take a few weeks, if not months. Until then it will be very difficult to transfer funds. [It may be better to keep BTC on an exchange before fork, to ease liquidity cost/time if you want to sell either of the coins immediately] &nbsp;


&nbsp;



‚Ä¢ **Double-spending:** Miners (from 2X) will have an ability and incentive to double-spend on the minority chain (lower mining power chain). If you have huge mining power, you can allocate some of it to just double-spend on the minority chain. Some people will possibly lose confidence in the minority chain as a result. &nbsp;



&nbsp;



‚Ä¢ **Replay-Protection:** Neither 1X nor 2X currently have replay protection. &nbsp;

**The OPINIONs section**



‚Ä¢ **Vinny Lingham's opinion:** 2X will outcompete 1X.  &nbsp;


&nbsp;




‚Ä¢ **Enter Bitcoin Cash:** A review by Ryan X. Charles who has incorporated some of Vinny Lingham's quotes, states the following: &nbsp;


&nbsp;




	
**a.** BCH is a fork of BTC with same PoW, but with improved Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA). BCH cannot die, but 1X and 2X could both die. If whales shift most of their holdings to BCH (or another coin), that would incentivise the miners to mine BCH (or another coin) instead of 1X and 2X. Both 1X and 2X would lose their mining power; however Core would release an emergency update to software adding DAA like BCH (or another coin). Thus, 1X would survive, and 2X (which might not get DAA) would die. &nbsp;


&nbsp;





**b.** If 2X continues to be the dominantly mined chain, 1X will be forced to launch an emergency update to their PoW with DAA. There could be fighting between the two chains, and as a result a struggle to become dominant --> potentially causing altcoins to flourish. &nbsp;



&nbsp;


**My observations**

‚Ä¢ **BCH** is upgrading their EDA (Emergency Difficulty Adjuster) on Nov 13. [See website](https://www.bitcoincash.org). This will lead to reduced volatility in BCH - likely making it more attractive to more long-term miners. &nbsp;


&nbsp;



	
‚Ä¢ **Mining profitability:** It is currently almost equally profitable to mine either BTC or BCH. &nbsp;


&nbsp;





‚Ä¢  What to keep and eye on before the fork to judge yourself where the fate of BTC is heading. &nbsp;

1. **Mining** signalling distribution


2. **DAA**: 1X or 2X software updates to implement Difficulty Adjustment Algorithms


3. **Futures** price before fork


4. Significant **whale** movement

This is attributed to a weakening of the dollar and fiat currency and an adoption of the BTC network. It seems a bit crazy to me, itb would need a major transfer of wealth from FIAT to digital currency. However i suppose an adoption event whereby people start using digital currency rather than fiat would mean trillions in inflows, which would mean multi million dollar BTC at least (assuming its where the fiat moves to)

Only reason I can see to move profits to BTC while we are on the current uptrend, is that BTC is also going up too. Whereas USDC/Cash would be doing nothing.

So the question is, is it best to take profits and move to BTC now. Then as BTC begins to top out in 2025, move profits to USDC/Cash for the next bear cycle?",1,2024-11-12 15:39:23,1

BTC,CryptoMarkets,BTC ETF - fuel for altcoin season? Quantum narrative growing?,"I've seen some say that if this btc run is fueled by ETFs, then those people won't be able to rotate into alts and hence altcoin season may not be as powerful.  
  
I don't see that concern at all. First, the etf creates major interest in crypto in general, and we know people are always going to seek major gains as they start to see all the various coins that multiply gains overnight.  
  
Sure, they can't buy altcoins through the etf (as of today anyway), but if they want that risk/reward, they'll find a way.  
  
And even if all the btc etf money stays put, it sure makes it easy for people to take profits while the price is held steady. The people who rotate a bit late will still have plenty of profit if ETFs keep feeding us.  
  
So, either way, there is a lot of fuel in the game.  
  
Picking alts is of course a tough game to play. There are many, spanning all levels of risk/reward. Some might succeed short term on marketing/hype alone. Some will get fed with pump/dump. Some will actually deliver useful product and succeed. Some will deliver, and never get adopted.  
  
I personally have been a believer that there is still a lot of room for improvement with layer1, and we have seen quite a few alts reach respectable marketcaps. Sure, many larger layer1s are down 50% or more from ATH, but we know they had massive rallies last cycle. They haven't faded away as many proclaimed would happen. Now it might be hard to break through those highs and repeat the major gains if there are bag holders who are just happy to recover.  
  
As far as narratives, one I understood a bit too early was quantum computing. I still follow along because I own QANX. I have long thought it has tremendous potential as a layer1- with or without the quantum narrative. That's purely because they are solving major hurdles to blockchain adoption, and they have solved how to leverage the top ecosystems. I also prefer a fresh layer1, as opposed to one trying to recover from last season.  
  
But now I've seen a lot of interest in the quantum narrative ramping up also.  
Apple has recent news of implementing post-quantum encryption. Google did the same a while back. Coin Bureau has had a couple twitter posts on the topic and some chatter in the discords. Even stock chats are picking up on it.  
  
Many think quantum computing will have an AI type awakening. Regardless of all the arguing about what it may mean, and how fast it is advancing, the news is going to be everywhere it because a lot is happening. People will have an interest in this topic because it is fascinating to say the least.  
  
Btw, don't accept the dated arguments that it won't advance quickly, and that if it did it would hack everything. It won't hack the ones that are prepared- there is a good reason big names are investing in updates. Not only is the speed and scale improving, the algos that will run on it are improving. Think about it, as people see the reality coming, they start looking at algos designed to run on quantum computing. Shor came up with one 30 years ago, of course we're going to advance from that.  
  
Overall, there are many choices, and there are many opinions of what has potential. Personally, I like the track record of layer1s, potential for tapping into new adoption, and some possibility of a narrative push if all else fails.  
  
None of this is financial advice of course- I can't emphasize enough there is a lot of risk the deeper you go. If you buy just because of a narrative or a post, start small so you can research. Every coin has its community who sees its potential, and just as many who will tell you why it won't succeed. And some projects that may very well be great may stay flat, some get lifted other ways. No good coin has a perfect track record, they've all had bumps in the road.  
  
Good luck all, I see the market it still running which I hope plays out the way we hope!",15,2024-03-04 17:25:48,27

BTC,CryptoMarkets,Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analysts Forecast BTC to Drop to $50K Before Parabolic Surge,"[Bitcoin's](https://www.nanovest.io/kripto/btc/) price is predicted to undergo a significant decline to reach $50,000 before initiating a larger parabolic surge, according to several prominent analysts in the crypto world. The formation of a ""double-top"" price pattern currently unfolding serves as the primary indicator for this potential downturn.

Double-Top Pattern: Strong Bearish Signal
Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, explained in an analyst note published on June 24 that Bitcoin is following a technical double-top pattern and currently testing its support levels.

This pattern forms when the price reaches two similar peaks with a slight decline in between, maintaining support above a common line known as the ""neckline."" The pattern typically completes when the price falls below the neckline, potentially dropping by the distance between the peaks and neckline.

""Bitcoin could transition from trading within the current range ($60,000-$70,000) to forming a top formation, which could lead to sharper declines,"" said Thielen. ""This formation could easily see a drop to $50,000‚Äîor even $45,000.""

Thielen added that despite potential positive impacts from the upcoming US elections and Consumer Price Index (CPI), Bitcoin's price could still undergo a sharper correction.

Impact of Decline and Post-Halving Speculation
Recent Bitcoin trading has indeed shown high volatility. After nearly hitting $70,000, nearing its all-time high, BTC's price has now dropped to $63,000. This decline is largely attributed to quick sell-offs by miners, profit-taking by investors near lifetime peaks, and outflows from US-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Several leading crypto traders speculate on Bitcoin's price post the halving event on April 20, which reduced Bitcoin miner block rewards by 50%, from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Crypto trader Jelle noted that current Bitcoin price action mirrors the post-2016 halving cycle and is ""circling around the previous cycle peak.""

Jelle stated this is part of a ""shakeout effect,"" where much uncertainty is released at the current prices. ""Either this is really overdone, or we are close to the low point,"" added Jelle in a post on X on June 24.

Short-Term Perspective and Expectations
Meanwhile, crypto trader Rekt Capital believes there is significant potential for further upward movement in the short term. In a post on June 24, he stated that the market is currently approximately 40% through the ""bull market"" phase.

This suggests that the recent dip in BTC prices below $60,000 provides buyers an opportunity to accumulate more as prices fall before Bitcoin enters a ""parabolic uptrend.""

On the other hand, upcoming economic data could also play a crucial role in Bitcoin price movements. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index for May, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, is expected to show the slowest monthly increase in three years. This could strengthen the case for a Fed interest rate cut starting as early as September, potentially supporting risk assets including Bitcoin.

In a weekly bulletin shared with CoinDesk, Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said, ""Strong recent economic data has pushed bond yields higher and precious metals lower on Friday. This continues to hinder digital hard assets like crypto.""

With several Fed governors scheduled to speak, along with GDP and PCE data releases this week, economists expect no significant changes in the PCE price index and only a slight 0.1% increase in core PCE, which is a 2.6% year-over-year rise.

At that time I'll want fiat money for new opportunities so, I'll focus the velocity on cash payments. Here's a real-life example:

My 2 BTC and 20 ETH and 3000 USCD are growing my BTC at just over 1% a month. That's about 600 USD per month. This is the fastest way to grow outside of some DeFi that requires a level of tech that's above me, for now!

BTC,CryptoMarkets,Can BTC Mining Delay an ATH?,"If we pay attention to Bitcoin's hashrate, we can notice that we are in a phase of consolidation, and even a decrease in block difficulty: the demand for bitcoin mining has decreased. This could suggest that some miners are withdrawing due to a difficult scenario following the recent halving.

But what drives miners to exit? In order to survive tough times, mining companies are forced to sell their coins to cover their operating expenses, which puts downward pressure on the market. This could explain why, despite net inflows into Wall Street ETFs, we have yet to experience a new ATH.

As time goes by, and the weaker mining companies exit the game and the stronger ones improve their efficiency, the downward pressure will decrease as there are no massive sales coming from mining, preparing the price to head towards $80k in the following months.",1,2024-06-20 19:55:57,10

BTC,Bitcoin,Italy Raises Bitcoin Tax to 42% ‚Äì Another Blow to Innovation and Financial Freedom,"The Italian government has just announced that the tax rate on capital gains from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will skyrocket from 26% to 42% starting next year. This outrageous increase is part of an attempt to ‚Äúcapture‚Äù more from the growing adoption of crypto. The Vice Minister of Economy even stated, ‚ÄúSince the phenomenon is spreading, we are taxing it more.‚Äù No clearer message could be sent: instead of encouraging innovation, Italy wants to punish it.

This new tax regime will stifle the budding crypto economy in Italy. Up until now, many Italians saw cryptocurrencies as an opportunity to diversify their investments and potentially counter inflation. But with this new punitive 42% rate, Italy sends a strong signal that any profits made in this space will be met with heavy taxation. This will likely push investors to either stop using crypto or move their assets and activities offshore, depriving the country of potential growth and jobs in blockchain and fintech.

The current 26% tax on crypto gains was already controversial, but this drastic jump makes Italy one of the most hostile jurisdictions for crypto traders and investors. It also raises questions of fairness. Why single out crypto assets with such a heavy tax burden compared to traditional investments? The government‚Äôs approach seems to ignore the fact that the crypto market is already highly volatile, making it much harder to guarantee profits compared to conventional financial assets.

What‚Äôs worse, these changes will hurt ordinary investors and small-time users more than they will hurt large institutions. Many retail investors, who got involved in crypto during the last bull market, will now face complex reporting obligations and heavy taxes if they decide to sell or trade their holdings. The only ones who might benefit are large players with access to expensive tax advisors who know how to navigate these rules.

This is yet another example of policymakers treating crypto users like cash cows. Instead of fostering innovation, Italy is alienating its crypto community at a time when other European nations, such as Switzerland and Portugal, are embracing blockchain technology and welcoming crypto businesses with favorable regulations.",1291,2024-10-16 14:13:29,601

BTC,Bitcoin,PSA: I lost nearly all my bitcoin by mining bitcoin,"On August 2021 I spent exactly 1 BTC on 6 Antminer S19j Pros. These were state-of-the art miners that cost $7,500 each, and were hosted with Compass Mining, which sources warehouses with cheap electricity ($0.06 kw/h which gradually increased to $0.08 kw/h).

As of today, these miners are no longer profitable to run. These miners are now worth $500 each (0.05 BTC for 6) which means I lost .95 BTC on the hardware cost.

Electricity for the miners was paid each month with the bitcoin mined. Of the .9 BTC mined between 2021 and today, .7 BTC went to electricity costs. This means in 3 years, the miners only made .2 BTC of profit.

So my initial investment of 1 BTC has resulted in .2 BTC of revenue and .05 BTC worth of hardware. I only have .25 BTC to show for all of this, a loss of 75%.

Please do not make the mistake I did, you are infinitely better off just buying and holding bitcoin than by trying to mine it. **The bottom line is bitcoin mining is subsidized by fiat loans, companies can absolutely make a profit in fiat terms by taking out loans to buy miners, but by spending bitcoin on miners directly the depreciation of the hardware will make it so you never, ever make a return in bitcoin.**

Right now an Antminer S21 costs 0.09 BTC and will net you 0.001-0.002 BTC a month after electricity costs. With a break even time of 4-7 years at the current hash rate (and hash rate only gets exponentially higher over time), you will never, ever make your bitcoin back.",1389,2024-05-13 16:30:27,470

Why should I risk my BTC for possibly more, but possibly less, I have honestly asked myself daily?

BTC,Bitcoin,I had 1.5 Bitcoin,"To start, I am not looking for sympathy or any sort of validation, I simply want to share my experience. I also would like to hear what would you do if you were ever in a similar situation. 2023 was a shit year, I was out of work for 6 months due to my wife being in the hospital for an extended amount of time with complications during and post labor, and leaving my stable job for another job that I thought would be better(it wasn't and I left new job soon after). To summarize, due to these circumstances and other poor choices, I ended up using the majority of our 1.5 Bitcoin to help us pay bills and survive for nearly a year. Now I am down to .02 Bitcoin. It took me awhile accept responsibility, and I've  damn near given up on the thought of ever getting back all that Bitcoin given th current price(took years to accumulate).

BTC,Bitcoin,My Wife And I Have Become Bitcoin Laughstocks üòÜ ‚ùå,"Recently, my wife and I bought a chunk of Bitcoin after years of discussing it between ourselves. The other night we were in the HouseParty app with 3 other couples. Of those 6 people, 4 are firmly entrenched in the legacy banking system.

While we haven‚Äôt disclosed the amount we actually put into Bitcoin, we did acknowledge to them we decided to buy. Big mistake.

For the next hour we were subject to constant jokes. Wherever there was a jab to be made, it was quickly converted to a Bitcoin joke and directed our way. All 6 of them relished greatly in it. We are good sports and laughed along. 

At one point, I began to genuinely laugh with them. Not because the truth of their jokes were funny, but rather I was laughing at them as they laughed at us. 

Why?

Because Bitcoin is real.

They can laugh all they want. What‚Äôs more hilarious is how clueless they really are. I hope you‚Äôll join me in laughing at those who laugh at us.

Let the haters hate and HODL on.

I don‚Äôt normally talk like this... but, HFSP.

Had to vent. 

Thanks for listening.

EDIT: Whoa. Have never had something blow up like this. Just wanted to vent as mentioned - didn‚Äôt realize it would connect like it did.

It sounds like most of us feel the same frustration. In that regard, I appreciate the kind notes and encouragement.

I do genuinely believe we are all on the right path and hope it works for us as intended.

BTC,Bitcoin,Ten Bitcoin lessons from someone who's been around here since 2013,"**Lesson 1:** Stop thinking it‚Äôs too late. We haven‚Äôt even seen the tip of the iceberg. Even in 2013, people would say ""Those that bought in 2012 were so lucky, we are too late.  We'll just get the scraps."" Same for 2017. You wish you bought when it was cheap, but would you? Probably not. Why didn‚Äôt you buy more when it dropped to $4K last year? Would you have held if your money tripled or quadrupled?

Everyone has been telling me it is too late since 2013. 99% of my friends didn't buy at $200, or $2000, or $20,000 per BTC because it was ""too late"". Don't make the same mistake. It's not too late, Bitcoin isn't even a teenager yet, it's only 12 years old.

**Lesson 2:** Stop thinking about the 50 BTC you lost on satoshi dice (yeah, coins were cheap back then), or the 5 BTC for that bag of herb that you smoked (or that acid you took). It‚Äôs gone. Stop thinking you should have sold at $20K and bought back in at $3K instead of hodling all the way down and capitulating ‚Äúto buy at $1.8K‚Äù. Stop thinking you can time the dips, and sell the tops. Stop regretting not buying earlier.

In short, stop fantasizing about what you could have done in the past and start thinking about today and the future. This is the mindset you should have:

*‚ÄúWhat should I do today, so that tomorrow, I won‚Äôt regret yesterday?‚Äù*

""Buy Bitcoin"" is the right answer, by the way.

**Lesson 3:** Building things will require a lot of sacrifice. I would have way more BTC if I didn't start a Bitcoin startup in the Philippines back in 2014. 7 years in this industry feels like 70! I grew many white hairs in the last 7 years. I know many people who have the same experience -- those who would be wealthier and more relaxed today had they just bought Bitcoin and Hodled instead of building stuff. But at the end of the day, you can still accumulate AND build. Again, it is not too late, even at this stage. Stack sats while building stuff! And always remember that the backbone of this industry are the tens of thousands of people out there, building stuff to make Bitcoin WORK, to make Bitcoin accessible. This isn't some vaporware with no backing - it is backed by human ingenuity and the blood, sweat, and tears of all the startups and companies out there making sure this thing survives and thrives.

**Lesson 4:** Bitcoin will keep surprising us. Don‚Äôt believe people who tell you they know what will happen. When you think it is time to sell because you‚Äôll be able to buy cheaper later, it will break out and up. When you think we will ‚Äúnever see X price again‚Äù we'll see it again. When people say this is is, this is the peak, it won't be the peak. Be prepared for faces to melt and minds to crumble into madness from disbelief at what Bitcoin will achieve. 

*There is no army in the world that can stop an idea whose time has come.*

**Lesson 5:** Bitcoin is a remarkable phenomenon, a once in a generation opportunity to participate in the evolution of how we move value around the world. Anyone that tells you otherwise is either ignorant or trying to deceive you. This network has gone through the most crucial tests of pressure and time that make it anti-fragile. Pressure and time, that‚Äôs really all it takes. Everything else will be built around this bedrock foundation.

**Lesson 6:** Mass adoption is a myth. Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt need ""mass adoption"". More like, mass adoption needs Bitcoin. It only needs a small % of the world‚Äôs wealth to ‚Äúget there‚Äù. Bitcoin makes no promises other than to reliably and consistently create new publicly verifiable blocks of immutable transactions every ten minutes. This is all it needs to keep doing consistently and securely for its value to increase exponentially over time. Everything else is gravy.

**Lesson 7:** We still have at least another decade of this crazy rollercoaster ride before Bitcoin starts to get even slightly boring. Just strap in and enjoy it.

**Lesson 8:** Make some friends along the way. Make enemies if need be. I‚Äôve made lifelong connections and relationships in the last 8 years in this industry. I have had a dedicated Buttcoiner hate group that created fake accounts similar to my name to try and embarrass me. Fake accounts, phishing, hacks, personal attacks. I don't give a fuck. And like I keep saying, we‚Äôve only just begun.

A lot of the people you meet today will be playing huge roles in this industry in the near future. You‚Äôll be in good company when the time comes. At the end of the day, life is all about the relationships you make along the way. Make sure they're meaningful ones.

Most of the friends I made since 2013 who have stuck around are already wealthy beyond their wildest dreams, and they're still sticking around, giving back, helping others, helping their communities, doing awesome shit.

**Lesson 9:** Do watch out for snakes and wolves disguised as people. Been scammed, lied to, stolen from, used, abused, harassed, you name it. There are a lot of bad actors out there, hiding behind smiling faces. They want what's yours and will go through great lengths to get it. Don't let anyone tell you different. These people will stab you in the back, slit your throat, take everything, and leave you out in the alley talking to yourself about what the fuck just happened. If you don't believe me, then you're the lamb that's going off to the slaughter.

**Lesson 10:** Take it easy. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in all the hype, to want all that attention. It‚Äôs easy to get lost in the confidence of a bull market and the despair of a bear market. Step back and try to gain the peace of a lofty perspective. 

When you‚Äôve been in the Bitcoin game for a while, you gain a certain peace. A relaxed comfort. Eyes open, ears open, radar up. Absorbing every message. Taking everything as it comes. Not mixing what they really are with what you want them to be. It's like an aerial view.

A view from above the myriad luck-dependent reactions of those who never gain such a peace. And when you gain that view, that peace - when you'd rather have the truth, no matter how disappointing, over a false hope, no matter how desirable - then you will finally understand the true meaning of hodling Bitcoin.

See you guys in another 8 years.

BTC,Bitcoin,Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin,"On November 28, 2017, the US Senate, Committee of the Judiciary held a hearing regarding bill S.1241: Modernizing AML Laws to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. Despite little attention being given to digital currencies during the hearing, bill S.1241 itself would amend the definition of ‚Äòfinancial institution‚Äô in the United States Code to include digital currencies and digital exchanges. This could have alarming consequences for users of cryptocurrencies both in the US and abroad.

Bill S.1241 would amend the definition of ‚Äòfinancial institution,‚Äô in Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, to include ‚Äúan issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency.‚Äù Currently, the definition of ‚Äòfinancial institution‚Äô includes banks, trust companies, credit unions, currency exchanges, etc.

In her introduction, Mrs. Feinstein, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, said (31:35), ‚ÄúThe bill criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account.‚Äù Although, during the hearing, no further clarifications were given as to the effects this would have on the cryptocurrency community, based on the amended definition of ‚Äòfinancial institution‚Äô, it seems clear enough that the bill would ‚Äúcriminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.‚Äù Wow. Let this sink in for a minute‚Ä¶

The US senate is proposing a bill to make criminals out of anyone intentionally concealing ownership or control of a digital currency or digital exchange account. What‚Äôs more, according to the hearing‚Äôs prolonged discussion of US law enforcement‚Äôs handling of foreign banks and financial institutions, this bill is certain to have far-reaching effects on not only US citizens but the global community as a whole.

If the above statement describes you, it is strongly recommended that you watch the hearing with this new definition of ‚Äòfinancial institution‚Äô in mind. If you‚Äôve already watched the hearing, watch it again, but this time replace all mentions of ‚Äòbanks and financial institutions‚Äô with ‚Äòdigital currencies and digital exchanges.‚Äô The implications are really rather alarming.

Interestingly enough, Ms. Kathryn Haun Rodriguez, a Coinbase Board of Directors Member, made absolutely no mention of digital currencies or digital exchanges in her testimony; nor was she asked any questions pertaining to these topics.

Conversely, in her July 2017 written testimony to the US House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services and Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance, she stated that some users of digital currencies use them ‚Äúto conceal and move illicit proceeds because of the perception that virtual currency is untraceable.‚Äù

Also in her prior written testimony, she stated that ‚Äúthe FinTech industry could be a very helpful partner to the government in addressing national security concerns;‚Äù that ‚Äúinvestigators like digital footprints and that is exactly what digital currencies provide;‚Äù and that ‚Äúof course, we can only follow the money to an individual or group if they used a Regulated exchange, one that follows basic AML/KYC laws.‚Äù Advertisement

Contrary to the bill itself, the hearing was noticeably lacking in references to cryptocurrencies; although there was some limited mention of such.

Ms. Klobuchar (2:16:58):

‚ÄúIs this transition we‚Äôre seeing from cash to digital going to make it easier or harder for law enforcement to track these money laundering cases, and you think these drug cartels are gonna start going cash free, and what do you do about it?‚Äù
Mr. John A. Cassara (2:17:15):

‚ÄúSenator, I‚Äôm just glad I had my career when I did because I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do trying to follow the money when it comes to digital currencies, it‚Äôs extremely, extremely challenging‚Ä¶I think if you look at the metrics, the metrics suggest today [that] digital currencies are a small fraction of the threat that we face. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs gonna be the case in 5-10 years from now. We‚Äôre right at a crossroads, and it‚Äôs going to be very, very interesting to see what goes forward.‚Äù
Due to the probable negative implications for the global cryptocurrency community, hopefully the interpretation of bill S.1241 in this article is proven incorrect; however, at this point, it seems fairly clear (at least to me, the author) that this is the intent behind the bill. If this is indeed the case, it will be the most recent attack on a growing list of State-backed attacks against the crypto-community.

Furthermore, from the noticeable lack of references made to digital currencies during the hearing, it would appear this bill is yet another underhanded attempt of the US Government to further erode global freedoms and civil liberties, which markedly began with the introduction of the Patriot Act, shortly after the 9/11 attacks.

As Tone Vayes mentioned, it would have been nice if Andreas Antonopoulos was there to impart some of the wisdom he shared with the Canadian Senate, on October 8, 2014.

Tone Vayes‚Äô summation*: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad‚Ä¶I think it‚Äôs gonna end in a very confrontational way between Bitcoin‚Äîeven Bitcoin holders and users‚Äîand the US Government.‚Äù

Jimmy Song‚Äôs summation*: ‚ÄúYeah, the nice thing about laws is they take a long time‚Ä¶‚Äù

Indeed it will be ‚Äúvery, very interesting to see what goes forward.‚Äù If this bill passes, how many of you future criminals out there are still set on hodling?

BTC,Bitcoin,"I put my entire savings 20,000$ into Bitcoin. With the intent to hold my savings in Bitcoin instead of fiat.","I've pulled the trigger, after thinking over it for a few weeks. 

I'm a software engineer who has spent the last 6 months developing payment processing services for Bitcoin and other crypto assets. I've had the pleasure of exploring and learning about how blockchain works, how transactions work, and its security at a deep level. Most importantly I've learned about just how much utility Bitcoin has to offer.

As I hear about more services, companies, and now countries are adopting Bitcoin, it's very clear that it's here to stay. But most importantly it's already started to begin reaching the ""soccer mom"" audience. People ""use"" Bitcoin, not just as an investment, or a get rich quick scheme. They use it to barter, pay bills, trade, and as a means of exchange for goods and services.

I don't just see Bitcoin as a chart in an app. I don't see Bitcoin as something you buy with USD. I see Bitcoin as Bitcoin. It's a currency in its own right, with value dictinct from USD and others. And given a decade, or two. I see it as the global currency for the future of all transactions.

Thanks for hearing my points.

Edit: A notice to those saying I'm making a mistake. I have no debt and if this money were to vanish tomorrow I'd be sad, but by no means will I lose my house, go hungry, lose medical coverage, or anything like that. I believe in Bitcoin as a primary currency and store of value, and want to hold my savings in Bitcoin.

Additionally, the US has a currency (USD), Japan has a currency (JPY), Canada has a currency (CAD), yet it's far fetched to believe the internet can't have a currency (BTC)?

BTC,Bitcoin,"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015","&#x200B;

**Edit.**

Thanks for all your suggestions and support.

I've received news from localbitcoins, I will update this once the authorities get in touch and decide course of action.

&#x200B;

In may 2015  [/BTC-OTC/](https://localbitcoins.com/p/BTC-OTC/)  scammed me and other 6 persons using bank transfer chargeback which led to my bank account being closed and all my funds frozen for 45 days.  At the time BTC-OTC  was one of the most reputable traders on  Localbitcoins.

I  shortly reported this to localbitcoins.com whitch led to BTC-OTC's account being banned and funds being locked - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhjCz/37f0ab1fc8.png)  also made a police fraud complaint to the relevant authority in UK

Localbitcoins freezed the funds stating the following in my support ticket  - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmDT/0a136c253b.png)

Since then I've been actively trying to get my coins with no result receiving only one single reply on my support ticket in 8 months

When contacting Max on linkedin his reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmJU/01610eaef4.png)

When contacting Max on reddit his reply was - [ HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmIn/71ff537bcf.png)   nevertheless 6 months passed with no reply on my ticket.

I emailed  Jeremias Kangas (CEO & Founder of LBC)  with no success. Also in my numerous visits at Metropolitan Police with this issue I was advised the same, this is a localbitcoins.com customer service issue not a legal issue.

Police official statement on my complaint   -  [ HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmOd/9045da5342.png)

National Fraud Intelligence Bureau advised  to change my fraud complaint against localbitcoins in order for them to investigate and contact localbitcoins regarding the case.

After 6 months of waiting, Max's reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmTD/d93973a8bf.png) , after sharing all the info on both support ticket and email he replied on email   [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmXK/a213a8d27b.png)

I knew this won't go anywhere so meanwhile I found a Metropolitan Police Sergeant specialized in blockchain and cyber-crime that understood this issue and decided to help me by contacting them using the fraud report I made in 2015.

Almost 2 months passed since he contacted localbitcoins (3 times) receiving no reply.

Reason I'm posting this is because  there are other 5 persons in this very situation, also other hundreds based on the posts complaining online.

Now I'm in the process of taking legal action. I've been in contact with over 40 lawyers from Finland, and found only 2 that are looking to take this case and quoted me at ‚Ç¨10.000 to  ‚Ç¨15.000 for civil proceedings,

Finnish Law allows only Ombudsman to initiate  a class action lawsuit so this can be settled only in civil court

BTC,Bitcoin,This is a very important message about bitcoin. Please take the time to read it.,"I mainly created this thread because of so many users coming here and saying bitcoin is old and outdated. These users are very misinformed. They've been fed misinformation by people that are profiting from spreading misinformation.

**Just read the bold text if this thread is too long for you.** The bold text is the summarized version and it contains all of most important information within this long wall of this text. I did this for users who don't like to read long posts. I know it's still long.

**If you'r a bitcoin veteran and you already know a lot about bitcoin:** Skip straight to the two bold paragraphs second from the bottom. They contain information about most of bitcoin's recent developments and second layer protocols.

**Bitcoin is just a protocol. It was released in 2009**

**TCP/IP are just protocols that were released in 1972. You could call them the backbone of the internet. Look at how long it took us to get to the internet that we have today, where TCP/IP is the backbone.**

[**Click here to read a bit about TCP/IP and blockchain technology.**](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain)

HTTP is just a protocol that was released in 1991. You could call it the backbone of the world wide web.

SMTP is just a protocol that was released in 1982. And IMAP is just a protocol that was released in 1986. You could call these protocols the backbone of email. Many people used to say that email was useless and nobody would ever use it.

TCP/IP was actually developed by cypherpunks just like bitcoin, PGP, and many other great protocols and technologies. In fact, two cypherpunks by the names of Hal and Len actually lived near each other and both helped develop TCP/IP. And they are also two of the three most likely candidates for being Satoshi. But that's not important.

People used to say computers and the internet was a useless waste too. Computers do use far more electricity than bitcoin mining. So perhaps they were right after all.

We are in the early majority. Bitcoin hasn't had it's Windows 95 moment yet, and I'll explain that statement below.

**Do you remember back in 1990 when everyone had heard of the internet but you didn't know anyone who used it? This is much like bitcoin right now, and even less people use the lightning network. Both are still in beta. February 1991 is when AOL for DOS was released. AOL for DOS made the internet fairly easy for everyone to use. But you still probably didn't know anyone who used it, and you probably didn't use it yourself. The internet didn't start getting popular until Windows 95 came out and most people still didn't use it for more years.**

**I can't wait to see where bitcoin is in a 12 years where it will be 23 years old. It was 1995 back when TCP/IP was 23 years old.** 

[**Click here to watch/listen to some news clips talking about the internet and email back in 1995 when TCP/IP was 23 years old.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95-yZ-31j9A) This was also the same year that Windows 95 was released.

**Bitcoin has the potential to be the backbone of the financial system.** And that's what people like the rocket scientist Michael Saylor are betting on. Michael Saylor is the same MIT graduate that predicted the mobile wave.

I want to inform you all that **I am not a bitcoin maximalist.** And my favorite cryptocurrency is actually an altcoin. I know you're shocked to hear that. But bitcoin holders please fear not, because **I still see bitcoin as the safest bet. And I also see bitcoin as the only protocol that has the potential to be the backbone of the financial system.** If this happened, then companies and countries would be using on-chain payments to settle large payments. There could be bitcoin backed currencies (like gold backed currencies of the past) and even bitcoin banks. **Hal Finney predicted there would be bitcoin banks in the future all the way back in 2010** Most people would be using second layer payment protocols to send bitcoin in milliseconds and costing almost no fees. And these **second layer protocols like the lightning network take a negligible amount of electricity to operate. Bitcoin can scale to handle as much demand as the world can create because of it's second layer protocols.**

Satoshi didn't create bitcoin to get rich. **He created bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without requiring trust or permission of anyone else.** Over 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as bitcoin. **Bitcoin has the most users, largest infrastructure, no premine, no developer fund/tax, no leader, longest track record, is the most secure, is the most decentralized, and bitcoins circulated freely for 18 months before ever having any monetary value which can never even be replicated by an altcoin because the genie is out of the bottle now.** And unlike the founders of every altcoin, Satoshi never cashed out. The issuance schedule and maximum supply of bitcoin are both clearly defined and will never change. Bitcoin development is decentralized and anyone can contribute because Satoshi published bitcoin under the MIT license so that it's open source and anyone is free to do anything with the source code. Bitcoin protocol rule changes are also decentralized because they require nodes to come to consensus.** All of this is why bitcoin is so vastly different than altcoins.

Cryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into altcoin cults. Gamblers use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their bitcoin stack [or even their ETH stack if they don't understand bitcoin and cryptocurrency,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&t=47m24s) and they aren't aware that Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the SEC, just said that ""a lot of crypto tokens, I won't call them cryptocurrencies for this moment, are indeed non-compliant securities"" this week. And nobody told them that the SEC disregarded previous claims made by Bill Hinman, former director of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance, who suggested that offers and sales of ETH are not securities transactions. But enough about that.

Gambling on altcoins can be very profitable during a bull run because the altcoin market is basically a short term casino where you actually have a good chance of winning. It's a relatively easy way to increase your bitcoin stack. 

**If you properly handle your private keys, then your bitcoin can't be stolen or seized and nobody can stop you from sending it to anyone else.** 

**Any protocol rule change that doesn't make any previously invalid blocks now valid is called a soft fork.** This would be a miner upgrade and is easier to accomplish, we can give the mining nodes a chance to upgrade, bip9 can be used, or the nodes can just run compatible software.

**All protocol rule changes must be agreed upon by fully validating bitcoin nodes.** Even if the mining nodes don't agree, if the full nodes come to consensus and make a rule change, people will continue to mine as long as it's profitable to mine, so the miners have to deal with it or piss off and other people will mine. The mining difficulty will adjust every 2016 blocks regardless. So when it comes down to it, only the users who run fully validating bitcoin nodes are in charge of bitcoin. 

**Fully validating bitcoin nodes must come to consensus on any rule change that makes any previously invalid blocks now valid, and that's called a hard fork.** This would be a pretty big upgrade, and it would be difficult to pull off with bitcoin because it's decentralized. And that's a good thing.

**There is a maximum supply of 21 million bitcoin**, and that will never change. Satoshi designed the protocol so that **miners solve a block every 10 minutes on average**. The block reward started at 50 BTC. **The block reward gets divided by 2 every 210,000 blocks** (4 years if the hashrate remained constant), which we call the block reward halving. The block reward is currently 6.25 bitcoin and the next block reward halving will happen around April 2024. And then the block reward will be 3.125 bitcoin. **The mining difficulty adjustments every 2016 blocks** which is approximately 2 weeks. So if it's profitable for people to mine, then hardware gets turned on and the mining difficulty increases. But if the price of bitcoin lowers so that some hardware is unprofitable to run, then it gets turned off and the mining difficulty decreases. And as the block reward gets divided by 2 every 210 thousand blocks, the **transaction fees will continue to incentivize miners to secure the network even when the block reward is minuscule.**

Many users here like to repeat that the last bitcoin wont be mined until 2140. And while it is true that the last satoshi will not be mined until 2140. It is also true that **approximately 97% of bitcoins will be mined by 2032**, and the block reward will just be 0.78125 BTC at that time. But if bitcoin is worth, for example, a million dollars, then the block reward alone in 2032 would be worth more than the current block reward + transaction fees at this time. That's not even accounting for all of the transaction fees that the miners will also be collecting from the transactions that they include in blocks. 

Bitcoin is constantly being developed.  **Bitcoin also has second layer protocols that are constantly being developed and they don't require any consensus.** So anyone can just create second layer protocols for bitcoin and nobody needs to agree on anything. It's up to the users of bitcoin if they want to use various second layer protocols that maximize the user experience. **One of bitcoin's second layer payment protocols is called the lightning network. It's still in beta but it already allows an unlimited amount of users to send and receive bitcoin transactions in milliseconds for extremely minuscule fees.** 

[**Bitfinex**](https://www.bitfinex.com/), [**Okcoin**](https://www.okcoin.com/), and [**Strike by Zap**](https://beta.strike.me/faq) have already integrated the lightning network so that people can deposit and withdraw bitcoin using it and [**Kraken**](https://www.kraken.com/) **will be integrating the lightning network later this year.** Kraken even has a US banking charter and [**Kraken Bank**](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/bank) plans to offer most typical banking services later this year.

**For newbies wanting to try out the lightning network:** I only recommend you to use [**Muun**](https://muun.com/) wallet or [**Phoenix**](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) wallet. They're both user friendly and they allow users to send and receive on-chain transactions or lightning transactions, all from the same wallet. [**BlueWallet**](https://bluewallet.io/) is also a great choice but it's more advanced than Muun and Phoenix.

**For US residents only:** Consider trying out [**Strike**](https://beta.strike.me/faq) by Zap. It has no fees and it allows Americans to use cash in their bank account to buy bitcoin and have it be sent anywhere in milliseconds using the lightning network. Or they can send a lightning payment and receive cash in their bank. So Americans can use Strike app to fund lightning integrated exchanges with bitcoin instantly, to fund their lightning channels with satoshis, or to make instant bitcoin lightning payments, and all without any fees. I believe that Strike is also capable of sending and receiving on-chain bitcoin payments

**Bitcoin has second layer protocols like the lightning network and statechains. The lightning network allows an unlimited amount of users to sent and receive bitcoin in milliseconds for almost no fees, and uses minuscule electricity. Bitcoin also has a second layer protocol called statechains that allow non-custodial off chain transfers which bypass paying transaction fees and waiting for confirmations. And statechains can also be turned directly into lightning channels at will. So statechains allow users to open and close lightning channels without performing any on-chain transactions, without paying a transaction fee, and without waiting for a confirmation.**

**Bitcoin is also switching to schnorr signatures and activating taproot this year which will improve privacy, security, and efficiency. This will also lower the operating costs of running a node and the transaction fees for exchanges by an expected 30% and it will also allow us to use many more second layer protocols that have been developed. This will also allow us to create massive multi-signature transactions that are substantially smaller in size, and will even allow users to aggregate all the multiple signatures of a transaction into one (multiple signers can produce a joint public key and then jointly sign with a single signature). Shnorr signatures and taproot will also allow us to use the coinswap protocol which is pretty self explanatory, the musig2 protocol which will allow aggregating public keys and signatures, new discreet log contracts which increases privacy and scalability minimizes the trust required in the oracle which provides external data for the contract, and point time locked contracts which will improve the privacy of bitcoin payments using the lightning network. Trustless cross chain atomic swaps should also be available towards the end of this year. Schnorr signatures also makes multi-signature and single-signature transactions indistinguishable on the blockchain so an observer will not even be able to tell if a multi-signature transaction or a trustless cross chain atomic swap has happened by viewing the blockchain. NFTs can also be done on bitcoin and that's where they were done first back in 2012. There's also various sidechains in development, including liquid network. There's the RGB protocol which will allow smart contracts to be done using bitcoin on the lightning network. And much more.**

**Money (not fiat currency) always evolves in four stages** (this is from the *what is money?* section of *The Nature and Creation of Money* chapter of a college course on *Principles of Macroeconomics*). **Bitcoin is currently going through the second stage of the evolution of money, which is a store of value.** The next stage is a widely used medium of exchange. Bitcoin may evolve into the third stage in 5 years, in 7 years, in 12 years, or **bitcoin may never evolve passed the second stage**. The final stage of the evolution of money is a unit of account. Bitcoin is also currently going through price discovery. **Bitcoin's true value needs to be found before it will ever be a widely used medium of exchange The lightning network also to be adopted by the users, merchants, and exchanges before it's even possible for bitcoin to evolve into a widely used medium of exchange.**",4579,2021-05-14 02:31:33,639

Now, though, I feel like it's different. I'm honestly looking for a way to give myself a comfortable future. I'm a felon bartender with a useless degree, and the pittance of a contribution to my 401k my paychecks provide is just mathematically insignificant. What's clear to me is that I'm perfectly happy literally burning my money, so I shouldn't have any trouble spending the same amount on something with real appreciating value -- *my future well-being*. And Bitcoin, of course.

Wish me luck.

Edit: Y'all are giving me way more inspiration and encouragement than I was expecting. Thank you sooooo much. Monday is my official quit date and I'll keep you posted.

Edit 2: based on a few people suggesting i buy *more* BTC *less often* -- due to fee structures I haven't figured out yet -- I'm going to do some research and come up with a more efficient method for buying than simply throwing money at BTC on Fridays, or whatever. Will update with maths and stuff.

2. After you logged in, verify your account if necessary. 

3. Press the ‚Äúdeposit‚Äù button and then deposit your Bitcoin from your Coinbase wallet. It‚Äôs free and takes only seconds. 

4. Press the ‚Äúwithdraw‚Äù button, then open the ‚ÄúBTC address‚Äù tab and put the address you wish to send your bitcoins to in there.

More importantly though, the two biggest things that recently convinced me I just had to do this, and I want to share, are:

1) I bought something on Amazon with Bitcoin using https://paywithmoon.com/ and the process was as exciting as the first time I downloaded a song with Napster. (Edit edit: this is definitely not the company I work for btw, someone clever suggested that)

2) I also read the piece ‚ÄúMasters and Slaves of Money‚Äù by Robert Breedlove (https://breedlove22.medium.com/masters-and-slaves-of-money-255ecc93404f) and it finally clicked: if someone can manufacture something for nothing and then get you to exchange your life for that thing, then you are a slave. It was true when the Europeans made aggry beads to buy Africans for the slave trade, and its true when the Federal Reserve and the Commercial Banks create monetary units by just pushing a button.

To put things into perspective, as of today Bitcoin is at all time highs in Pakistan, Laos, Burundi, Malawi, Nigeria, Myanmar, Ethiopia, Cuba, Ghana, Egypt, Congo, Iran, Turkey, Sudan, Syria, Argentina,Suriname, Sierra Leone, Lebanon and Venezuela. 

Now during the earlier days 21 Btc was the ""must have"" amount, until that goal became out of reach due to market rallies and ofcourse Fiat inflation.

I do believe due to Fiat inflation and Bitcoin deflation that 0.1 Btc is the new 1 Btc.

I remember staring at bitcoin a few years ago. When bitcoin broke single digits for the first time, I thought that was a triumphant moment for bitcoin. I watched and admired the price jump to $15.. $20.. $30.. wow!

Today, I see $17,539 per BTC. I still don't believe reality sometimes. Bitcoin has changed my life, and I have far more money than I can ever spend. My aims, goals, and motivations in life have nothing to do with having XX million or being the mega rich. So I'm doing something else: donating the majority of my bitcoins to charitable causes. I'm calling it üçç The Pineapple Fund.

Yes, donating ~$86 million worth of bitcoins to charities :)

So far, The Pineapple Fund has/is:

* Donated $1 million to Watsi, an impressively innovative charity building technology to finance universal healthcare.

* Donated $1 million to The Water Project, a charity providing sustainable water projects to suffering communities in Africa

* Donating $1 million to the EFF, defending rights and privacy of internet users, fighting for net neutrality, and far far more

* Donated $500k to BitGive Foundation, a charity building projects that leverage bitcoin and blockchain technology for global philanthropy. 

If you know a registered nonprofit charity, please encourage them to apply on the fund's website! While I prefer supporting registered charities, I am open to supporting charitable causes as well. Check out the website :)

It suggests we're mid-way through the current rally with no signs of slowing.

After each crash, we've longed for dips to buy in, and now, amidst an uptrend. Even if the idea of using leverage such as a loan or credit card, where the interest rate is much lower than the current uptrend rate, seems not a bad idea. What's holding you back from investing now? What are your thoughts about this year bull run?

BTC,Bitcoin,My brother killed himself because of BTC,"I don't really know where to post this but I feel like I need to vent.

Do not take this as criticism of Bitcoin, blockchain technology, or cryptocurrency users & developers, it's not.

There are probably other factors that led to my brother's suicide, but he had been beating himself up over Bitcoin for the past several years to the point where he seemed constantly depressed over it and gradually became a shadow of his former happy self.

He claimed to have owned 15,000 at one point, which may have been an exaggeration. But I know for a fact that at some point around October-November 2012 he did have at least 6,000 BTC which he showed me in his wallets. He was so enthusiastic about Bitcoin and how cryptocurrencies would revolutionize the financial world. For awhile he was annoying the fuck out of our relatives about how it would make them millionaires.

I'm not sure exactly what happened to his BTC. Sometime in 2013 he claimed to have lost most of them in a hack and sold the remainder too early. He very well may have sold them all too early, but who knows.

 As the price took off in late 2013-early 2014 you could tell he was distraught over it and became increasingly withdrawn from family and friends. Whenever I did manage to contact him he would sometimes end up ranting about how badly he had fucked up and how he would never have a chance to be rich again.

As the price climbed up to 10k over the past several months it became even more difficult to make contact with him, he just wouldn't reply to me or my parents calls and texts. A couple weeks ago my parents flew out to see my brother and found him dead by suicide with no note. He was 29 with 50 years of life ahead of him.

Other than obvious grief I don't really know how to feel about this. If I had missed out on $50M I might have killed myself too. I can't imagine what my brother must have been feeling these past several years knowing he missed his best & easiest shot at the wealthy life he had always fantasized about. Bitcoin totally fucked up his mindset to the point where you couldn't talk about anything related to investing, money or finances without him storming off or crying.

If there's any more of you in a similar situation feel free to PM me. Please try to recognize there are endless economic opportunities in life and 1 mistake doesn't define your future. There are family and friends who care about you and will listen.",8903,2017-12-05 02:22:58,1889

**How I send mistakenly 1 BTC to the Huobi Cold Wallet?**

A day I was watching a BTC rich list and exploring the addresses. I'm unsure how exactly it happens because I verified the address, but when I sent 1 BTC I did mistakenly to the wrong address!!! I verified that I was sending to the correct address, but I had to remake the sendship because the wallet crashed, probably there was the problem, the huobi's cold wallet address was in the clipboard. Anyways I don't have certainty how it happens.List:  [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)

It was a mistake, I work often sending and receiving BTC. When you do a certain task all the days copying wrong data could be a **TERRIBLE** but **EASY** mistake to do, because we are humans and we fall in the trust. **As you did a task correctly many many times you earn trust on yourself and try save time.** If it didn't happens to you ever you aren't being honest.

**7 months talking with Huobi Customer Support (part 1)**

I tried to contact Huobi's customer support. First they first didn't understand me, thinking that I tried to deposit on Huobi and sent to a wrong address. After they understand they told me that the address doesn't belongs to Huobi and they can't help me. That is false, I did an investigation and they have direct relation with this address, they can help me. Read my following analysis please:

&#x200B;

**Huobi Ownership Analysis**

Searching, sites says that the address belongs to Huobi Huobi support says that address doesn't belongs to Huobi

I don't know if belongs to Huobi or not, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi

Why? The address 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 regulary sent big amounts to 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D

Then, is VERY PROBABLY THAT 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 OWNER KNOWS 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D OWNER And the 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D OWNER can help me.

Searching, some sites (and sites like USDT Official page [https://web.archive.org/web/20181113185656/https://wallet.tether.to/richlist](https://web.archive.org/web/20181113185656/https://wallet.tether.to/richlist)) says that the address 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D belongs to Huobi

Again, I don't know really if the address is of Huobi, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi

Why? On my Huobi account I made only 2 BTC withdraws from Huobi in the past

2018-05-08 18:36:45 , txid: 0e6bf02323ebc166b6638afcd6170ecb73948748235e687def7e7a3cb1902fca , it has 239 inputs 2018-05-08 20:17:10 , txid: b59b988d642fe3773268e246ef1a0d048bbd3f734a611d00722b39126ed9e20b , it has 239 inputs too

In both transaction, all inputs are addresses that BELONGS TO HUOBI, because you huobi are sending me BTC

Both transactions has 39 addresses as inputs in common (all huobi address, maybe deposit addresses of anothers huobi users)

**7 months talking with Huobi Customer Support (part 2)**

After understanding this , they asked me my consent to pay a fee. I agreed. After they asked me sign a message with my privates keys. I did it. And finally they tell me ""Wait"". I'm waiting 7 months ago, all months I ask and they ever reply the same ""We will contact you"". Now they told me "" HelloÔºåsorry for the inconvenience, we feedback your problem to our technology department.¬† After a series of research and development, but it can not be solved.¬† Please understand this.¬† ""

I want to think that the team is failing and Huobi isn't wanting steal my BTC. What they are doing maybe could be illegal. I'm thinking to talk with lawers on Singapore, I don't know what more to do.

I tried to contact the CEO Livio on Twitter ( [https://twitter.com/livio\_huobi](https://twitter.com/livio_huobi) ) but they don't reply me! I want to think that someone else is administering their account.

BTC,Bitcoin,"$25,000 reward for information that leads to the retrieval of stolen BTC","Hi Reddit,


Today I had 2.86 Bitcoin (~$189,000) stolen from my Exodus Wallet. I have filed a complaint to Manhattan DA and the FBI. I‚Äôll be working with them to try to retrieve the funds but they seem to be taking their time. In the meantime, I was hoping someone here could help with providing any information that can lead to the retrieval of the funds. If the information leads to the successful retrieval of the funds, I‚Äôm willing to award $25,000.

The funds were stolen from the following address:

bc1qzdg0592yrhsdkc882dzxkqcutjc8vhx3qp2676



The following two transaction hashes are associated with the movement of funds: 

Txt hash 1: 731123b0e25ebeb8a1dc866122deb7c779380aba08bccbda4f0f68cbe78dc247

The BTC seem to have landed on this address and hasn‚Äôt moved: 

bc1qlpz5he7nxkqegvvjg3x9hc46sza59sg7xaanhq


If somehow the attacker is reading this, you can keep $25,000 from the stolen funds and return the rest to the original address (bc1qzdg0592yrhsdkc882dzxkqcutjc8vhx3qp2676 ). Additionally, I‚Äôm willing to retract my complaint with the FBI and Manhattan DA.

BTC,Bitcoin,"Found 0.5 BTC after 8 Years ‚Äî Should I HODL, Sell, or Trade?","I just discovered that I have 0.5 BTC, which I completely forgot about! I had them in an old wallet that was thankfully still active. The key was in an email draft from years ago; thank God I had access to that email account. I stopped using it a long time ago.

The story is: I got them in June 2016. A friend and I did a small project together. We earned 1 BTC and then split it between us. BTC wasn‚Äôt worth much back then, so I didn‚Äôt really care at the time. I almost assumed I had lost them. Now, I‚Äôve just bought a Ledger wallet to keep them safe!

I feel a bit sad too because if I had discovered them earlier, I might have made some good money by now. The price was higher in the past than it is now. But here I am, wondering what to do next.

I know a lot of people say HODL, but how long should I hold on to them? It‚Äôs been 8 years‚Äîshould I keep holding, sell them, or try trading? I‚Äôve never traded before, so I‚Äôm worried I might lose it all if I try. Maybe put some part of it in Alt Coins?

BTC,Bitcoin,This aged well: Woman divorces husband for reading r/Bitcoin (aka cult of clueless idiots) and HODLing too much BTC... in 2014. Get ready to laugh.. extremely entertaining read.,"I remember reading an old r/relationships post about a woman who was furious at her husband for his ""cult like"" belief in bitcoin and mocked him for thinking he was ""in at the ground floor"". She goes off on a diatribe and mocks him every chance he gets for his ""foolish"" beliefs and how he spends his money on buying and holding bitcoin... she consider any bitcoin that he holds to be ""lost money"".

I actually saved this when I read it back years ago to see one day how it would age... man talk about the worlds biggest I told you so. She had zero faith and respect in her husband. I hope he has a garage full of lambos in his giant mansion.

Here are some of the highlights  snipped for your own entertainment:

\-------

&#x200B;

""My husband (I'll call him John for the sake of anonymity) and I have been married for a little over 5 years now and everything has been going well up until a year or so ago. We were planning on having children and everything. Now my life feels like it is at a complete stand still.""

Skip to 2013...

"" We are both avid redditors so when we find a new subreddit that we love we get excited and start sending each other links to see if we can get the other one interested  He finds out about bitcoin and is sending me links constantly about it.  (r/bitcoin) It goes from ""check out this cool technology"" to absolute cultish behavior in a very brief period. I would say 0-100 in probably 2 months. He starts taking every dime we have and buying them as quickly as he can. **He actually set up a feature that BUYS MORE ON A WEEKLY BASIS** after our paychecks come through. The worst part is he didn't even TELL ME he did this. He gave me this arrogant response about doing what's best for us and our future kids.

Overall, and I'm not exaggerating, I would say **we have lost over $22,000.** I kept telling him to sell as the price was rising and he promised me a big year in 2014. **The price kept falling and he CONTINUED TO BUY MORE.**  He makes more money than I do but we are building a future together and we have a shared bank account. He kept telling me this was for our kids college fund, to buy a house, etc. The money...I can get over as people spend money on other stupid crap like boats they will never use but this isn't even the beginning to the absolute craziness I will see out of him over the coming year.

My husband starts bringing up fucking bitcoin at these events. MY events for MY job. People here have a lot of money and he knows this. He saw this as some kind of opportunity. He goes on and on about how taxes are theft and bitcoin is a way out. The dollar is about to collapse, banks are destroying the world, etc. You are supposed to make light hearted jokes about how their football team is doing, not get into these political discussions. He knows this too since he's been coming to these events with me for years.

It starts off small where I laugh it off and say ""ohhhh John, he's into technology and gets a little too excited"". He saw this as condescension. The car rides home? Full on fights about how **I don't get it and I'm going to be left behind.** I felt like I was fighting with some type of evangelical Christian (I have been in plenty of these growing up). He ironically rips into religion any chance he gets but he is **absolutely part of a cult full of insane people.**

Keep in mind as this goes on he is still buying more as the **price goes down telling me we have a great opportunity on our hands**.  He ignores long term trends and focuses on these specific time frames to show me how stupid I am. Yes, my husband called me STUPID over THINKING I do not understand it.

I feel like I have read more about bitcoin than he has because he won't discuss any downsides with me. He tells me all problems will be fixed and **we are in on the ground floor**. He seems to be in a constant good news bubble about this **when no one actually cares**. Most of the responses he gets from people in public are feigned interest until they can get away from him or they just tell him they don't care if the converstaion lasts more than 2 minutes. **I am embarrassed to be around him.**

After a **recent price crash, he actually bought more using our vacation fund** that I have been saving away for AND planning. **All gone, in bitcoin never to be seen again.**

I am sorry for the long rant but this is my life now. I have tried everything. I have tried reasoning with him. I have tried explaining to him that he should not have sole control over our money. **He is so confident that he slyly brings up selling one of our cars to buy more**. He didn't come right out and say what it was for but I can guarantee you it was to buy more. He is ruining my job and **robbing me of happiness.**

I used to consider him a smart guy and **I never, ever thought he would succomb to basically being brainwashed by a bunch of clueless idiots on the internet who seem to know absolutely nothing about finance or the real world (**r/bitcoin**).** I don't know how familiar people are here with bitcoin but if you go to their subreddit, you will see exactly what I'm talking about. I started crying once reading my husband's comments worded slightly differently, repeated 100 times over. It was like I married a parrot.

What do I DO? I am not religious in any way but my family most certainly is. **I feel like I couldn't even bring up divorce and I want to save my husband.** I want him back to the way he was. It seems like he is addicted to a drug but since he doesn't realize it, everyone else is wrong. I don't know if I should have an intervention or just walk away and hope he comes to his senses when **I'm staying in a hotel for a few weeks.**

Again, I apologize for the length but I want you to feel the way I feel so you can understand the advice you are giving. I really need help here. Thank you to anyone who even reads half of this!

My intention was to try and help other everyday people understand the wealth creating opportunity in front of them (without giving financial advice, and acknowledging that there are risks. I certainly wouldn't encourage anyone to go all in). If Bitcoin continues to gain institutional acceptance, it is likely to do multiples in coming years, which will change my family's life, and I'd like to see others benefit too. 

I was surprised at just how much anger my post received. I tried to be balanced, and wasn't shilling any referrals or links where I personally stood to benefit.

BTC,Bitcoin,How Grayscale is Dumping BTC and Why You Shouldn‚Äôt Panic,"Hi, fellow Bitcoiners! 

You may have noticed that the price of BTC has been dropping lately, and you may be wondering what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôll share my opinion with some data.

Well, one of the main reasons is that Grayscale, the largest Bitcoin fund in the world, is selling some of its BTC to meet the redemption requests of its investors.

But before you freak out and sell your BTC, let me explain why this is happening and why it‚Äôs not a bad thing in the long term.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is a fund that allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to buy or store it directly. It has been around since 2013 and has accumulated over 600,000 BTC, making it the second-largest holder of Bitcoin after Satoshi Nakamoto.

However, GBTC has been facing some challenges recently due to the emergence of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US market. These ETFs are funds that track the price of Bitcoin more closely and charge lower fees than GBTC. 

As a result, many investors decided to switch from GBTC to the new ETFs, creating a massive outflow of capital from GBTC.

**There are two main reasons why investors are leaving GBTC:**

1. Grayscale charges a 1.5% annual management fee for GBTC, which is 5 to 6 times higher than the fees of other ETF issuers, such as ProShares and Valkyrie, which charge 0.3% and 0.25%, respectively. 

2. Many investors bought GBTC at a 40% discount to the net asset value (NAV) of the fund, hoping to profit from the premium that GBTC used to enjoy. However, the premium has turned into a discount of around 0%, making GBTC less attractive than the spot ETFs.

To meet the redemption requests of the investors, GBTC has to sell some of the Bitcoin it holds and transfer the proceeds to the investors. According to data from CryptoQuant, Grayscale has moved over 41,000 BTC worth over $1.7 billion to Coinbase Prime since January 12, 2024. This selling pressure has contributed to the decline of the Bitcoin price, which has dropped below $43,000 as of January 18, 2024.

**How Long Will This Last?**

The GBTC outflows may continue for a few more weeks, as investors adjust their portfolios and seek better alternatives. During this period, the Bitcoin price may face more volatility and downward pressure. However, once the situation stabilizes, the investors who sold GBTC may reinvest their money into other ETFs that have lower fees and better tracking of the Bitcoin price. This could boost the demand for Bitcoin and support its recovery in the long term.

Therefore, it is important to have patience and not panic during this transitional phase. Bitcoin is still a valuable asset that has a lot of potential for growth and innovation. Remember, this is a long-term game!

First off, as Ecclesiastes 1:9 states:
>What has been will be again,

>  what has been done will be done again;

> there is nothing new under the sun.


Over the last 7 years I have seen all these questions about what to do, these statements of selling, and others commenting how stupid and ignorant anyone who sells ‚Äúright now‚Äù must be. People have called me a fucking moron for daring to part with some of my bitcoin, or argued with me that I don‚Äôt understand what I did. They are sad people (jealous? myopic? entitled?

**The story** 

I got into bitcoin back in 2013 or so, reading about it and really going down the rabbit hole. I am a scientist, and it is my nature to go deep on things of interest. One thing I learned in my graduate studies was ‚Äúhow to learn‚Äù (how to research). For you whippersnappers ‚Äì that means more than Google and YouTube. So I learned, I read, I watched interviews, I set up a node, I mined shitcoins to understand how that worked (and traded them for bitcoin in the end.) Nobody I knew was into bitcoin, and nobody would listen to me about it. I tried to get my brother interested. I tried to get a tech friend interested. Both of them agreed it was ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù but not enough to acquire any bitcoin (this was around the time of bitcoin being just under $1k, before it dropped for several years post MtGox meltdown). So I carried on alone, with just the interwebs to console me.

In 2017 when bitcoin hit $4,000 or so, I sold 40 - enough to pay off my mortgage and cover my original costs to acquire all my holdings (avg sale price $4320). If bitcoin ate shit and died, I had a good ride, and had a paid off house to boot. I think it was a week or two later that it was $8,000. Then soon after it almost hit $20k and started dropping. I didn‚Äôt panic, but I woke up in mid-December and my brain screamed ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be greedy‚Äù to me. I listened to my brain and sold 60 BTC at around $15.6k each. Additionally, as I had my coins on Coinbase, when they opened trading for BCH in late December I dumped them within the first hour for around $3550 each. When all was said and done I had made somewhere near 1.5M USD. 


If you have questions about how much I paid in taxes, how I moved the money, if my bank gave a shit (spoiler: they did not) etc. it‚Äôs covered in [this post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/fxho4v/stop_the_bullshit_if_you_sell_your_btc_on/) with details asked in the comments. You also get to see people tell me I am wrong, so there‚Äôs that fun as well. 


I kept the rest of my BTC, and watched the price shrink down over the next couple years. I wondered if I had made a mistake by not cashing out, missed my ‚Äúbig chance for maxxx profits‚Äù or whatever, but it didn‚Äôt really matter that much because a few months after I made the initial money and paid my taxes, **I fucking retired**. Yes, as of almost 3 years ago, I retired. It wasn‚Äôt only because of the bitcoin ‚Äì I had saved money, had a 401k, and an IRA. I was on my way to a modest retirement somewhere in my 50‚Äôs or so if I wanted it, but then BOOM, I had a huge nest egg, a paid off house, other savings, and additional bitcoin for the future. Cool. kthxbye work world!


I have spent the last 3 years leisurely pursuing my own things like art and music, woodworking, collage, gardening along with sleeping in and lots of meditation and porch dwelling. There have been several small tragedies in my life since then (parents in poor health, for one) and so I have been able to tend to that more so than I could if I was working. Being retired has given me so many options and so much control over my life. I love it.


Some of you might be thinking something along the lines of - Now here we are‚Ä¶bitcoin is worth $40k so roughly speaking this guy (me) ‚Äúlost out‚Äù so far on about 2.4M after taxes. There‚Äôs also the fact that if I had kept working these last 3 years I would have additional income/savings that I could have invested so let‚Äôs round up to 3M after taxes, assuming I sold the 100 BTC now and the BCH immediately (I‚Äôm not a fan, and actually am surprised it didn‚Äôt die). How do I feel about losing out on $3M (and counting)? Honestly, not particularly bad.

Here‚Äôs the deal ‚Äì when you get to a certain point in your net worth, where you can cover your costs for your lifestyle and more (and this number is different for everyone, for me I‚Äôm really chill, so no lambo interests) the money sort of converts itself into a score like on a video game. I can look back and think ‚Äúoh man, 3 million fucking dollars more! Oh shit!‚Äù but do I lose sleep over it? No. Do I kick myself? Not really. My score is lower than it could have been‚Ä¶ but in return, I got to help a friend die peacefully, I helped another friend pivot his business, I moved to a new city and bought a cool house (still own the old one as a rental, but maybe not for much longer), and I get to wake up every day and do exactly what I want to do (minus covid issues). It‚Äôs really nice to be out of the rat race. It suits me well. I know now that I could have made more - but at the time I had no clue, and there is something to be said for the comfort of the sure thing. 


My base take is this ‚Äì we only have so much time on this planet, and I‚Äôd like to maximize my control (vs. my wealth) as much as possible. It would be hard to imagine reliving the last 3 years with a full time job, and I don‚Äôt care to dwell on what might have been. I hit my retirement number (1.5x my number + remaining BTC) and GTFO of the system. That money has grown in the funds I put it into, and I never touch principle. My remaining bitcoin became and remain gravy and I plan on hodling until it doesn‚Äôt make sense anymore. My advice to all of you is to do your research, know your game plan for selling (I didn‚Äôt really have a solid one, honestly), be excellent to each other, and live that life. Ignore the noise ‚Äì from nosy people in internet forums, from grouchy jealous jerkoffs, etc. This is your deal. 

I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions. Hope you found this interesting.",3239,2021-01-10 07:24:20,566

Has or is this happening to anyone else? I moved my money off of exchanges a couple of years ago because this was supposed to be safer.

I can verify the following: My computer (MacBook Pro M1) does not have any malware installed on it. I downloaded and installed my Exodus wallet more than 2 years ago, and I downloaded it directly from Exodus; it's not a fake wallet. My iPhone was not compromised. I'm not the victim of any phishing attempt. My physical laptop and phone have not been stolen.

BTC,Bitcoin,I will buy and hold BTC for the rest of my life. No matter what others tell me.,"Hey Bitcoiner,

I'm at a point where I am more than 100% convinced in what I'm doing. I will work, save in Bitcoin, hold and repeat. ""But what if the price will crash?"" - that's human psychology, I don't look at the price Bitcoin will crash again and again and again and it's okay

I understood it. There is only 1 network in the entire world which is absolutely scarce. Bitcoin. Bitcoin not crypto. Bitcoin nothing else.

You can find more gold, you can find more silver, they will build more houses, they will print infinitely more fiat and altcoins can be changed (because they aren't decentralized at all. It's always a group of people who can decide the rules).

No single identity can change the supply of Bitcoin. Never. It's not a question of software. It's a social question. If someone wants to change the 21M supply he would have to convince thsousands of people which are running a node to accept his rules.

Bitcoin is the only decentralized timestamp. Bitcoin is the monetary black hole because everything will extend but only BTC will be fixed. Bitcoin is the hardest money ever invented/discovered and everyone can run his own node, have his own private keys and nobody can stop it. Bitcoin is the solution to humanity's money problem since there are humans on this planet.

If someone tells me: ""no you shall not put everything into one basket."" Then I know with 100% certainty that this person is new to Bitcoin or to lazy to study it. I thought the same at the beginning. After many years of studying I know there is only 1. Bitcoin.

When bitcoin was brand new I was your average left wing teenager that wanted nothing more than to kick the banking system down to the ground. Suddenly I read this article about how Bitcoin was the answer to that so I immediately started to mine.

Some time after that we had to sell our pc but before that I made sure to make a backup of my wallet and the only thing I had at the time was a shitty usb used for school and a 3.5‚Äù floppy disk, i chose to floppy disk.

For all the flaws I have it‚Äôs incredibly rare that I misplace stuff, the amount of items I‚Äôve lost these last 20 years can probably be counted on my two hands. Of course one of those things had to contain an unknown amount of bitcoins. Most certainly quite a lot of complete bitcoins.

BTC,Bitcoin,*Must read for newcomers* My friend worked in the Bitcoin industry (broker) for a couple of years and has been involved in the crypto world since 2014. This is what he had to say about the recent politics of btc when someone asked him on our crypto trading channel,"(He first sent this article https://medium.com/@StopAndDecrypt/thats-not-bitcoin-this-is-bitcoin-95f05a6fd6c2, then followed up with this reply when someone told him he had no idea what he just read)

""There was a big scaling debate and in the end there were two sides. Those that wanted to scale using bigger blocksize (short term solution that doesn't work long term and also causes more centralization) vs those who wanted to scale using changes in the code to make the network more efficient aka SEGWIT+second layer scaling solutions (bitcoin becomes massive settlement layer, and second layer solutions can take care of verifying your $3.25 coffee payment). 

On the big block side you had (most) miners because they were only able to see the short term benefits of increased blocksize and they do not care about network centralization. Also, a chinese miner controlling a sizeable chunk of the network's hashrate had access to (and was in the process of patenting) this technology called ASICBOOST which is an exploit in bitcoin code that allows you to ""cheat"" and get extra hashing power out of your miners. Essentially they had an unfair advantage and the KEY is that the segwit upgrade fixes this exploit. Alongside these miners you had a couple of misguided (but incredibly wealthy because of early adoption) individuals who either have a reason to see bitcoin fail (like they are heavily invested in altcoins now) or they are too pigheaded to back down when wrong (or some of them I'm sure are not actually intelligent enough to understand they are wrong).

On the Segwit side you had all the core developers (the guys who worked side by side with satoshi to build all this and have been contributing to the code for years every day), the majority of the userbase, AND the vast majority of bitcoin companies. The two sides were basically arguing over who had control over bitcoin - was it the miners, or was it the users? Was it those who chose which software to run (users) or was it those who verified transactions for that software (miners)? (The answer as you will see shortly is Users). So basically these miners were stalling the upgrade because it would mean the end of their unfair (AND patented) advantage. This massive stalemate in the debate caused a community led uprising known as the User Activated Soft Fork movement (UASF). These guys basically said ""We're switching our nodes to Segwit software starting Aug 1 and we will be rejecting all mined blocks that do not comply with the new code"". This forced the miners' hand as they realized they would either be forked off the network or have to go along with the new upgrade to make sure everything continued to go smoothly (including their profits).

The movement gained enough support to freak out some big money bitcoin CEOs who got together in a room with the miners and made a deal behind closed doors known as the New York Agreement (NYA). This is where Segwit2x was born. The key to note here is that not a single core dev was invited to this meeting (in fact, not a single competent dev in general was invited). The terms of the deal were: You guys agree to implement Segwit now, and then we'll agree to an increase in block size later (November). Deal was made and obviously the majority of the user community was in an uproar because bitcoiners hate closed door deals (and they should for good reason). 

That being said, it got Segwit activated because it gave miners an easy way to safe face and go with segwit and the community instead of seeing their profits get wrecked by a messy chainsplit. However, do you remember that sneaky miner who had patented the ASICBOOST technology? Well he was part of the NYA and he decided to fork off anyway and create Bitcoin Cash. So stop right here and realize that the only reason we have bitcoin cash is so that some miner with a ton of hashing power could keep his unfair advantage over the network (he stills mainly mines bitcoin by the way because he would go out of business if he switched entirely to bitcoin cash). Also at this point, technically the NYA was broken because the whole point of it was to avoid a chainsplit and go with segwit followed by a block size increase whereas bitcoin cash was a clear chainsplit.

So for a few months everything was ok because we had Segwit, core devs were still with us, and (supposedly) anyone who wanted bigger blocks had forked off to bitcoin cash right? Wrong. See it turns out that those guys who made that backroom deal with the miners also had their own interests which involve removing the current core developers from their (imagined) seat of power. It is classic old school business politics - they don't care that core the devs are based around principles of meritocracy and peer review. They just want to have more of a say in the direction bitcoin takes. At this point, you might be thinking, ""Ok but its fair for companies who use a product to have a say in its development, right?"" NO. Not when the ""product"" at stake is meant to be an incredibly secure, incorruptible ledger that can hold trillions of dollars in wealth and still be hosted online accross the world. 

The fact is that no one understands the code better than the core developers and no one has more of an interest in seeing bitcoin stay decentralized and secure than these guys do. These guys literally cum buckets everyday to how much they love coding bitcoin. If Satoshi is Cypher Jesus then these guys are his Apostles. And on the other hand you have some severely misguided corporate buffoons who think they have the knowledge to negotiate a compromise with a group who has nothing but short term profit in their sights. And when the core developers are like ""wtf dude?"" and the community stands behind them, then these guys resort to essentially trying to kick core out of bitcoin by starting a new chain. A new chain which was based on a compromise that no one wants or needs anymore. And the excuse these CEO's are hiding behind is ""We don't want to go back on our word."" Classic business mindset vs coding mindset.

ur word."" Classic business mindset vs coding mindset. 

Now we come to the current situation where there are basically 4 sides

1. Core developers, and those supporting them
2. The (remaining) signers of the NYA and those supporting Segwit2x 
3. Malicious third parties who just want to see bitcoin fail (invested in altcoins/bitcoin cash or they are the Joker and just want to see shit burn)
4. Innocent bystanders


The core developers are continuing to code and improve bitcoin and they are working on second layer solutions. They haven't stopped development and have actually made a TON of beneficial changes to the code since the Segwit upgrade allowed them to. Being non-political or atleast being shit politicians, these guys do not know how to handle themselves with other people and either don't speak much or come off as pretentious d*bags (trust me I used to hate them before I smartened up). 

The remaining NYA signers. I say remaining because alot of companies left when they saw the massive backlash from the community. The only signers left are miners and then a group of around 30 companies which all have ties to Barry Silbert's holding company Digital Currency Group and suprise surprise who do you think got that NYA meeting together in the first place? Silly Silbert indeed. He's basically trying to do a sort of corporate take over of bitcoin where he decides who is writing the code and how they write it. Oh also I should note here that these guys have 1 developer working on the Segwit2x code. Yes 1, Jeff Garzik. Coding ability? Mediocre at best. All he did was copy and paste the entire bitcoin core code (because its open source) and changed the one little value that dictates block size. He changed a 1 to a 2 haha! And when he tried to make other changes he made critical mistakes that had to be fixed by CORE DEVELOPERS hahahaha! So how the f* does that even compare to an army of geeks who have been coding bitcoin for years and coding in general for decades who are all constantly trying to find mistakes in each others' work. SO people supporting Segwit2x are either severely misguided, hate core devs, or don't have all the information to make an informed decision.

Now the malicious actors. These are people who have a vested interest in seeing bitcoin crumble. I'm talking about big altcoin investors and bitcoin cash supporters (yes the guys who have ASICBOOST and want are the reason for this whole mess in the first place). And Segwit2x has presented them with a beautiful vector of attack. Divide and conquer. Right? And whereas with bitcoin cash there was replay protection (meaning the split was pretty clean and bitcoin was largely unaffected) this time they haven't got any planned - so should things go through as planned, things could get messy.

Then you have all those innocent bystanders who don't really know what to think anymore. Things have gotten so convoluted and complicated that it is hard to follow who wants what anymore. These are the people who will get the most fucked by something like Segwit2x because they won't understand the risks as it is happening and they won't have the knowledge to know which wallets to support. Imagine Segwit2x happens and one wallet sticks with the core version of bitcoin and the other wallet supports the segwit2x version but they both just say ""Bitcoin"".
 
That is why people are soooooooooooooo strongly opposed to Segwit2x more than anything. It is nothing more and nothing less than a hostile takeover attempt. And at this point that should be more than clear because why else would you still support the compromise made with miners who broke the compromise by creating bitcoin cash? No one wanted Segwit2x in the first place. People wanted bigger blocks, or segwit, not both. Segwit2x was never a faction in the debate. It was a faction that was spawned by those who created the NYA because they saw an opportunity take control of the software development from a group of developers who have been working on it for years and who strongly oppose corporate interests getting involved in bitcoin development.""

FATOSHI loves his tasty bitcoins and he wants to share them with you. Where does the name come from? ""Fat"" is the way rewards should be and ""Toshi"" is from Satoshi, the smallest unit of a bitcoin. The Satoshi to Bitcoin ratio is 100 million to satoshis to ONE Bitcoin and every satoshi received directly in your wallet is a fraction of the most powerful cryptocurrency as of now. 

&#x200B;

Among thousands of memetokens, FatSatoshi (aka FATOSHI) was born, thought of in the mallest details to bring to its holders the latest in tokenomics. The idea is to show that the meme family is growing, however, real quality is here, designed so that the results  of trades are always favorable. All tokenomics were thought to achieve the perfect balance for better results. Higher prices and green candles, this is what really matters and this is what every holder looks for.

[Bitcoin 2021: Ross Ulbricht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V_SkLxgQjQ&t=369s)

Are you inspired to do something after watching that? We sure as hell are.

Bitcoin early adopters Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht helped spread the use of Bitcoin when it was less than $10 dollars and someone in this community finally made a coin to help both of them get out of jail and for its holders to make some money. We call that a win-win where I‚Äôm from.

üò≤ Who the heck is Julian Assange?! ü§¶

Julian Assange is the founder of Wikileaks, an international non-profit organization that publishes news leaks and classified media provided by anonymous sources. 

ü§Ø How about Ross Ulbricht?! ü§¶

Ross Ulbricht created the first darknet market, the Silk Road, as an exercise in free market capitalism, a website where users were free to post and buy whatever they felt necessary so long as no party was being harmed. 

These pioneers who have fought for individual freedom, now need our help to be saved from unjust prosecution and sentencing (far reaching government oversight amirite?). 

Join our fight and help raise funds for the legal defenses of Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht. Protect your rights and generate yield at the same time!

üéá Ad Campaign! üéá

This project launched with NO ICO and is just getting started! We are starting our marketing push in December so get in EARLY!! 

üí∏Shillers will be rewarded too!üí∞

What are the Tokenomics?

‚úÖ Utility! The ‚ÄúFree‚Äù in Freemoon!

5% of every transaction is donated to the legal defenses of Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht. Fight For Freedom! BE A HERO!

üí≤ Autonomous Yield AKA Money for Nothing!üí≤

3% of every transaction is automatically redistributed to existing token holders via reflection.

‚¨áÔ∏è Deflationary SupplyüÜôüí∞

2% of every transaction is put back into the liquidity pool and LP tokens are burned, creating a deflationary supply.

üíçüôå HODL!üíéüôå

Transaction Fee 10%

üîê Liquidity Lock üîê 

For further price stability, Freemoon will use DxLock to restrict 50% of the supply for a duration of 4 years.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,SatOllie's Diaries: from the genesis of Bitcoin until the present day ($BTC on Solana),"**8/8/2024: The Genesis of Bitcoin**
SatOllie here! After reading that token creation on pump fun is now FREE, my mind went into overdrive. A peer-to-peer electronic cash system. A currency that could change everything. I felt this rush of excitement, the same feeling I imagine the original Satoshi had when he penned his Bitcoin whitepaper. I dropped the link in the ""Street Bets"" Discord. Time to see if the world was ready. Spoiler alert: they weren‚Äôt. Not yet.

**9/8/2024: The Slow Drip**
Woke up and checked the chart, expecting to see fireworks... instead, just a few buys trickling in. Street Bets was too busy getting rugged by some presale coin to notice my groundbreaking creation. Classic. Oh well, early days, and patience is key.

**10/8/2024: The Rise Begins**
Boom! We‚Äôre gaining traction! Word has spread about this revolutionary digital currency called Bitcoin, and throughout the morning the buys kept rolling in. By midday, we hit King of the Hill status! We even started a Telegram group, and I‚Äôm feeling this nostalgia vibe - it‚Äôs like the Bitcoin forums and newsgroups all over again. I paid for a Dexscreener listing in anticipation of bonding, and to show my commitment to the project.

**11/8/2024: Jeet and Repeat**
The King of the Hill high didn‚Äôt last long. Some folks jeeted hard, as expected. A lesson learned from the old Bitcoin days: not everyone has diamond hands. But the vibe in our Telegram channel? Electric. It feels like a time machine straight to 2009, with OGs reminiscing about the early Bitcoin days. The community is small, but it‚Äôs mighty.

**12/8/2024: Pump Fun Shenanigans**
Thanks to some generous investors, we now have marketing funds. Time to play with the big boys. We launched a bump bot on pump fun because, let‚Äôs face it, visibility is everything. Market cap‚Äôs creeping towards $60k. Slow but steady wins the race. It‚Äôs crazy watching history repeat itself, but now in this wild west of meme tokens and SOL bonds.

**13/8/2024: The Raydium Rollercoaster**
Someone dropped 30 SOL on $BTC today, finally completing the pump fun bonding curve and launching us on Raydium! It was glorious for about five minutes before they immediately sold off, tanking the price in a sharp drop. Oh, the joys of early crypto markets‚Äîwild swings and instant heartbreak. Onward and upward!

**14/8/2024: Jeet Storm**
$BTC is now live on Raydium! The market cap hit $54k for a hot second before the inevitable jeeting began. Totally normal, and honestly, I‚Äôm not even mad. It‚Äôs part of the process. The thrill of the game keeps me going.

**15-16/8/2024: The Raid Begins**
We‚Äôve built a solid Telegram community‚Äî200 strong and growing! Raids are happening everywhere: Reddit, X, you name it. We‚Äôre making noise. The people need to know about this coin, and we‚Äôre here to make sure they do.

**17-19/8/2024: The Calm After the Storm**
The weekend was quiet‚Äîtoo quiet. Most of the early pump fun buyers have taken their profits and moved on, leaving us at a $13k market cap. But this? This is where the real fun begins. We‚Äôve formed a strong floor, and the diehards remain.

**20/8/2024: The Diamond Hands Chronicles Begin**

The Telegram has become one big LARP, and honestly, we‚Äôre having a blast. Memes, jokes, and talks of the glory days are keeping us going, but make no mistake‚Äîwe‚Äôre still in this for the gains. The dream? To push this market cap high enough that we can all afford some pizza with our $BTC. The laughs are great, but we‚Äôve got our eyes on that moon. Time to rebuild and send it.

**SatOllie out.** üíé‚úã Let‚Äôs keep making history.

Bitcoin ($BTC) is the first LARP-driven memecoin on the Solana network.

**Tokenomics:**

10% BTC Reflection | 6% Liquidity | 2% Marketing

¬∑ Liquidity Fees are used to boost the Liquidity of the token until 25% Liquidity has been reached. After this, the Fees will be added to the Buyback wallet until the Liquidity is out of balance again.

¬∑ With the Buyback Fee the contract will accumulate BNB to use for a Buyback Event. In this event, the contract will buy Tokens and Burn them afterwards. Sell Fees will be doubled for the duration of 30 minutes to prevent people from dumping.

¬∑ 5% of each transaction is converted into BUSD and sent automatically to the wallets of holders. No more hassle with claim functions!

And you think this is the end of it? During the 1st hour, any sell will result in 30% tax per trade. If you don‚Äôt understand the reason why.. go back to school.

Meet EMMA our AI investor. Basically it will have a chart like a rebase token without the rebasing.

Emma will be fronting BabyBitcoins project Overload

Overload is a complex, multi-tiered program based on the blockchain-based economy. What started as a side project is rapidly becoming the main utility for this token.

Overload generates revenue through a combination of crypto services that work in unison to leverage each other in their ecosystem. 
Through multi-levels of high detail code, Overload achieves high returns by providing computing power and storage through specific software channels used by today's top blockchains.

The ROI (Return on Investment) is given as an indication and reflects the current state of the network, just-mining cannot guarantee its maintenance or evolution.

Over the next 6 months (beta-testing and live operation), Overload is aiming to generate multiple channels of high returning yields for our token and our investors.

Once proven as a reliable product, we will look at expanding the power of overload to provide reasonable low-risk investments opportunities for our holders.


BabyBitcoin is now 4 months old and has a UK based and doxxed team behind it.

I am sure you have seen our name... join us in our telegram if you have any questions. There is no doubt that even a small percentage of Mermaid in your crypto portfolio will add a lot of long term value.
We also have planned for next week a sister token that will be providing liquidity to Mermaid in the form of a daily buy back and burn. That means Mermaid will be moving to a deflationary token and the current value of all tokens will increase. Partnered with this Mermaid will be offering golden hour for tax free buying to allow our new and existing holders to buy up the token with 0 tax. A lot planned and we still have the big CG pump to come. 
The whole goal is to bring Mermaid back to a $100k daily volume and $1mil+ market cap. We also have plans to increase the % of liquidity which will help stabilise the price at a higher level.",258,2021-12-14 10:43:23,498

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,$CONE - Best memecoin on reddit! Why buy Bitcoin when you can buy Bitcone?,"What is BitCone ($CONE)?

BitCone (CONE) is a Decentralized Community Utility Token made by Cones, for Cones. 608 Billion tokens were created on the Polygon Network (with no mint function) to parallel the 608 Cone Head - Reddit Collectible Avatar NFT, that inspired a meme Conemunity. 

BitCone is governed democratically, so every decision is voted on via Conemunity Polls. 

BitCones can be earned through Airdrops and ""BitCone Mining"", a revolutionary automated content monetization platform, that incentivizes user engagement on partnered Subreddits.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

What can Bitcone be used for?

- Post 2 Earn - BitCone Mining, rewarding engagement with CONE Tokens
- Tipping on Reddit.com/r/ConeHeads and other Subreddits
- Trading Reddit NFT Avatars on the AvatarMate.xyz Avatar Marketplace
- Earning Liquidity Rewards
- Minting NFT with CONE Tokens
- Bidding on Auctions with CONE Tokens


How many CONE tokens are there in circulation?

CONE was deployed on the Polygon Network on September 20th 2022, with 608 billion CONE tokens, created to parallel the 608 Cone Head - Reddit Collectible Avatar NFT that inspired it. 

There is no mint function in the CONE Smart Contract, so there can never be more than 608 billion BitCone.

Week 1 - We have a pre-arranged list of telegram call groups we will have promos going out to (around 30 for week 1). Also we have a few twitter promos lined up. We also will be trending on all coin voting websites such as coinsniper and watcher Guru. As well as trending on reddit (Obviously)

Week 2 - After week 1, we will have a weekly Youtube influencer video every week. We will have promos going out on twitter, social media sites such as 4chan, 9gag and stocktwits. (reward dashboard will go live too)

Week 3 - After week 2, we will begin our PR campaign which will consist of articles on large websites to drive constant traffic to our chart, website and overall brand.

Week 4 - We will begin to apply to CMC & CG as well as listing on other tracking websites. We will also announce our use case.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,üåïFreemoon Airdrop News üåï: Bitcoin OGs Julian Assange from Wikileaks and Ross Ulbricht from Silk Road finally have their own token üí∏ and it‚Äôs Airdrop time baby! $50 worth of Freemoon to the first 1000 signups & $10 afterward! (Details Below) üöÄ,"Grab a Kleenex and clench your fist in anger as you watch a hero of crypto get treated like crap üò°üò†

[Bitcoin 2021: Ross Ulbricht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V_SkLxgQjQ&t=369s)

Are you inspired to do something after watching that? We sure as hell are.

Bitcoin early adopters Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht helped spread the use of Bitcoin when it was less than $10 dollars and someone in this community finally made a coin to help both of them get out of jail and for its holders to make some money. We call that a win-win where I‚Äôm from.

üò≤ Who the heck is Julian Assange?! ü§¶

Julian Assange is the founder of Wikileaks, an international non-profit organization that publishes news leaks and classified media provided by anonymous sources. 

ü§Ø How about Ross Ulbricht?! ü§¶

Ross Ulbricht created the first darknet market, the Silk Road, as an exercise in free market capitalism, a website where users were free to post and buy whatever they felt necessary so long as no party was being harmed. 

These pioneers who have fought for individual freedom, now need our help to be saved from unjust prosecution and sentencing (far reaching government oversight amirite?). 

Join our fight and help raise funds for the legal defenses of Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht. Protect your rights and generate yield at the same time!

üéá Ad Campaign! üéá

This project launched with NO ICO and is just getting started! We are starting our marketing push in December so get in EARLY!! 

üí∏Shillers will be rewarded too!üí∞

What are the Tokenomics?

‚úÖ Utility! The ‚ÄúFree‚Äù in Freemoon!

5% of every transaction is donated to the legal defenses of Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht. Fight For Freedom! BE A HERO!

üí≤ Autonomous Yield AKA Money for Nothing!üí≤

3% of every transaction is automatically redistributed to existing token holders via reflection.

‚¨áÔ∏è Deflationary SupplyüÜôüí∞

2% of every transaction is put back into the liquidity pool and LP tokens are burned, creating a deflationary supply.

üíçüôå HODL!üíéüôå

Transaction Fee 10%

üîê Liquidity Lock üîê 

For further price stability, Freemoon will use DxLock to restrict 50% of the supply for a duration of 4 years.

## Whitelist your address by December 31st 2021 to claim your free Freemoon tokens! How much? $50 worth of Freemoon for the first 1000 signups, $10 thereafter!

We believe Freemoon is about the community coming together for the common cause of helping to free our crypto brothers Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht who are languishing in jail while we enjoy this most recent bullrun.

We hope this Freemoon Airdrop will raise awareness of the two men who are in a big way responsible for crypto's success, and mobilize a movement of people to make a positive change in the world.

# Community Development

Early adopters rejoice! History will look back on your crypto addresses with envy! You are the foundation for building this community and making a difference in this world!

# AirDrop Details (Easy as 1 2 3)

This Airdrop is the first of many promotions to show the community and the world we mean business, in the coming weeks we will hold more promotions, however this is your chance to be earlier than the rest of the early adopters!

Here's how:

1. Follow us on: [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/freemoonmain) & Follow us on [**Telegram**](https://t.me/freemooncommunity)
2. Enter [HERE](https://freemoon.io/airdrop.html) on our website and fill out the required information as seen below
3. DON'T FORGET TO CHECK YOUR SUBSCRIPTION!

The Lore

$Mettfure was rugged early on by a disgrace to they boys club, thats where the COMMUNITY decided our beloved mettfure desrved far better.

The CTO began 2 months ago, community worked hard towards building this up into something BILLION MC worthy and now their efforts bear fruit.

Why bullish?

- $Mettfure promises a no rug project, its evident from the fact that its a CTO and its lasted more than 2 months.

- Breath taking Animations rendered on a complex 3d imaging system.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,ORIGIN TRAIL $TRAC AND WHY THIS IS THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY SINCE BITCOIN ...,"$TRAC

Origin trail has been around a while.  Current market cap $55 M. So why is this a moonshot, well what I about about to tell you will explain if you are prepared to read for a few minutes. To cut to the chase this will be a multi billion dollar coin.

$TRAC has been 10 years in the making. Origin trail is not a private company instead it is an open source code created by trace labs to tackle issue that have never been resolved.

The first project I will talk about they are collaborating with will be the biggest however they have several other huge projects this combined will put exceptional price discovery on $trac.

Origin trail have been working with GS1 for several years [https://www.gs1.org/](https://www.gs1.org/) . GS1 Are a not for profit organisation like Origin trail and trace labs. GS1 set global standards for global communication. They created the barcode, amongst other creations, in the 1970s and have been managing its global standards ever since. GS1 Are going to implement a new global standard see video - [https://youtu.be/HDqzTbzabq0](https://youtu.be/HDqzTbzabq0) . GS1 and Origin trail are creating a decentralised knowledge graph that will host every barcode item in circulation. Thats billions of products with massive amounts of transactions per day. It has not been rolled out yet however there is a big announcement on the 17th you should sign up to find more [https://liftoff.origintrail.io/](https://liftoff.origintrail.io/) This solution involves a decentralised data bank that can link every chain legacy and new to the knowledge graph. Think of it as a interoperable decentralised server that every company can tap into to log new products, enquire about products, records movements, audits, just about anything you can imagine. Oracle, SAP, Walmart, Pfizer, Pepsi, Vechain.. the list is endless, they will all use this as it will become a global standard. There has never before been a trusted way for different organisations to immediately share data with.

So how is this going to make $trac a moonshot - GS1 Have 2 MILLION Business clients they advise, also BSI [https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2019/january/bsi-partners-with-origintrail-to-develop-blockchain-enabled-solutions/](https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2019/january/bsi-partners-with-origintrail-to-develop-blockchain-enabled-solutions/)  will use this, they have 84,000 business clients. We are talking almost every serious company in the world. $trac will be used to pay for data enquiries ect via a fiat on ramp much like companies do to buy Oracle credits per say. This on ramp is a simple payment gateway, companies need know nothing about crypto as when they purchase data usage it is a auto market buy for $trac to pay the node runners. This will create immense buying pressure that will propel $trac regardless of bear or bull market. This will be the first truly mass adopted utility crypto. As the knowledge graph its self is not on the blockchain it can scale indefinitely. Thumbprints will be stored on chain instead. odn INFO - [https://tech.origintrail.io/protocol](https://tech.origintrail.io/protocol) .

In all my time researching projects I believe this is the one, guaranteed mass adoption.

And to think this is just one of the projects that Origin Trail are working with. They have been selected to help build the next generation Internet and also Parity Polkadot on their solutions.

DYOR and join the dots. Id encourage you to do it soon as once people understand what is happening, its implications it will blast off.

The team have over the years not pursued mass exchange listings as they know what the final goal will mean. However they discussed at a recent AMA they may list on one more reputable exchange soon. I share this with yous as yous have shared projects with me.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,LUNA INU ($LINU) Trending on Coinbase: Memecoin with Potential Ahead of Bitcoin Halving?,"I've been keeping an eye on the crypto market trends and something interesting caught my attention. **LUNA INU (LINU)**, a memecoin, has been consistently on **Coinbase's Trending** list for two consecutive days. Check out this [link](https://streamable.com/f0yj34) showing it trending. I understand that the right memecoin can potentially yield returns of 100-1000X, far surpassing the typical gains seen with many altcoins.

With the **Bitcoin halving** approaching in April, and the market likely to see shifts, LUNA INU's presence on Ethereum's network makes it an intriguing investment prospect. There's a lot of chatter about Ethereum experiencing a significant price increase in the next bull run, which could positively impact LINU as well, considering the stronger liquidity it might gain against the dollar.

- **Have any of you invested in LUNA INU or are following its performance closely?**
- **What are your thoughts on investing in memecoins like LINU, especially with Ethereum's potential rise in the near future?**",79,2024-01-25 23:23:41,66

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,As Seen on CoinMarketCap | Official Mollars Initial Coin Offering | Live Presale | ~21K Tokens Sold | US$0.30 Currently | Bitcoin for Ethereum Blockchain,"üí∞Token name: Mollars

‚Äî Token symbol: $MOLLARS

‚Äî Official ICO/Token Presale page: [https://www.Mollars.com](https://www.Mollars.com)

‚ùå ALERT: If not Mollars.com it‚Äôs not legit. Avoid fraud scam using the Mollars Name ‚ùå

‚Äî Token type: ERC-20

‚Äî Blockchain: Ethereum

‚Äî ICO Token Price \[opening round\]: US$0.30

‚Äî Amount of tokens available in ICO: 4,000,000

Brief breakdown on what the official Mollars Initial Coin Offering is creating in crypto:

Store of Value Concept: Mollars is being highlighted as a store of value token and has received attention from credible sources like CryptoPotato. Despite cautionary Reddit posts about potential scams, let's rely on trustworthy sources such as the official website and endorsements by Crypto Potato to understand it better.

Unique Proposition: Mollars aims to achieve complete decentralization, boasting robust security, popularity, and a capped total supply. They claim to have a mathematical formula designed to potentially boost its value over time as the available token supply diminishes.

Trading Anticipation: When Mollars hits Uniswap, it's expected to experience an initial surge in trading price by around 200%. The estimated listing day price is approximately US$0.62.

Utilization of ICO Funds: The ICO funds will be allocated to a well-structured marketing strategy executed by a team of professionals. The goal is to sustain consistent growth in token value across four quarters in 2024. Additionally, no tokens will be held off the market, validated through public audits, potentially averting unexpected fluctuations in token supply.

Potential Performance: Mollars might outshine Bitcoin in terms of transactional value, especially with ongoing enhancements to the Ethereum blockchain.

Current Status: Around 16,000 tokens have been sold, amounting to approximately US$5,128. They plan to make 4 million $MOLLARS tokens available during the presale.

‚Äî  How to Purchase

Interested buyers can acquire Mollars using Ethereum ($ETH) or Tether ($USDT) through the official website.

‚Äî Listing Details

The proposed initial cryptocurrency exchange listing for Mollars is set for May 1, 2024, or within 45 days of reaching their hard cap.  It will list at a +200% gain, starting public trading at US$0.62cents. That‚Äôs over double the investor's initial investment per token.

[Bitcoin 2021: Ross Ulbricht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V_SkLxgQjQ&t=369s)

Are you inspired to do something after watching that? We sure as hell are.

Bitcoin early adopters Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht helped spread the use of Bitcoin when it was less than $10 dollars and someone in this community finally made a coin to help both of them get out of jail and for its holders to make some money. We call that a win-win where I‚Äôm from.

üò≤ Who the heck is Julian Assange?! ü§¶

Julian Assange is the founder of Wikileaks, an international non-profit organization that publishes news leaks and classified media provided by anonymous sources. 

ü§Ø How about Ross Ulbricht?! ü§¶

Ross Ulbricht created the first darknet market, the Silk Road, as an exercise in free market capitalism, a website where users were free to post and buy whatever they felt necessary so long as no party was being harmed. 

These pioneers who have fought for individual freedom, now need our help to be saved from unjust prosecution and sentencing (far reaching government oversight amirite?). 

Join our fight and help raise funds for the legal defenses of Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht. Protect your rights and generate yield at the same time!

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Bitcoin to $100K: The Next Big Wave in Crypto,"Bitcoin is on track to hit $100k, and it feels like we‚Äôre on the edge of something huge. With so much institutional interest pouring in and global adoption speeding up, BTC‚Äôs rise seems inevitable. Smart investors are positioning themselves for the long game, and it‚Äôs clear that Bitcoin‚Äôs only going to get stronger from here.

And as Bitcoin pumps, Hege is primed to follow. We just signed with a top-tier marketing agency, so expect to see a lot more of us out thereüòÑ. Plus, our venture capital backers have been buying in even more‚Äîthey see the potential here just like we do. (Do you?) But the acctual real power? Our community. We are the foundation, and with everyone‚Äôs support and excitement, Hege has become something bigger than just a project.

When BTC breaks through, it brings liquidity and attention to the whole market. Hege is ready to ride that wave and make some serious moves. We've got the momentum and community to back it up‚Äîthis is just the beginning for Hege!

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,BTC | A micro-cap token on Solana with 1000x potential. Miss out buying bitcoin in 2009? Don‚Äôt make the same mistake again,"It's 2009, you are still feeling the pinch of the 2008 market crash. Your wife is hungry and her boyfriend is trying to move in with you because he lost his job. It's a simpler time. All of a sudden you start hearing whispers on the internet of some strange internet money, it's called bit-coin?! 

You find yourself in a group on some weird Russian hacking app called Telegram and find that it's being run by some cult, all they do is speak gibberish about buying pizza with these internet points. You aren't too sure, but you don't want to let these Russian propagandists win! 

You decide to ape $50 dollars and forget about it. 10 years pass and you are no longer married and your now ex-wife is calling you from her ex-boyfriends house and asking if she can move back in with you. You are startled by the idea because you haven't fucked anyone in nearly 9 years since she left you for drawing dicks on pizza charts for the russians. It's all a blur but she tells you that one of your bitcoins is worth $9,642 üò± 

Now 10 years on, your wife is back and she's left her ex-boyfriend and things are worse than ever!

SO WHY NOT APE INTO $BTC ON $SOL TODAY AND YOU CAN RUIN YOUR LIFE TOO!

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Introducing Baby Satoshi: the first & only BITCOIN reflection token üöÄ. Now with increased BTC reflections of 11%! Sitting at only $1.4m MC BabySats is the next 100x,"Introducing Baby Satoshi: the first & only BITCOIN reflection token üöÄ 
 
Since the last post was made on Baby Satoshi the market cap has almost tripled and is now sitting at $1.4M, almost triple since this token was last posted about on CMS. Baby Satoshi is also current trending on Dex Tools top trending #6. The dev has talked about Btok marketing coming soon and tweets from big influencers like LilMoon and others have been happening regularly.  

The marketing budget for this token is huge and the team is ready to take it 100m with the right team and marketing behind it. Baby Satoshi is the first token to get listed on CMC and CG in under 6 hours and the liquidity pool of $400,000 for a $1.4 million market cap token is too good. This has potential to go to 10m+ easily. Im calling it here now get in and start earning BTC as passive income.  

Love it or hate it, ü™ô Bitcoin has become synonymous with the cryptocurrency world ‚Äî but if we hope to survive the tumultuous market unscathed, we need to get a little creative. That‚Äôs why we made BabySatoshi on BSC. BabySatoshi is the first and only token that automatically pays holders with Bitcoin reflection rewards. 

Why Bitcoin? Everyone knows that Bitcoin is king. The halving jumpstarts the bull market every few years. Altcoins' success is dependent on Bitcoin market sentiment. Everyone's trying to stack those sats and accumulate more Bitcoin. When the market starts tanking, Bitcoin tanks much less than other altcoins, making it the perfect crypto to collect. The best part about BabySatoshi is that you accumulate more Bitcoin when it's cheaper, so you benefit more during bearish conditions. So, it seemed like a no-brainer that Bitcoin would become the perfect payout incentive. tl;dr If you believe in Bitcoin, you better believe in BabySatoshi as well. 

Tokenomics Total supply is 100,000 $SATS. No more can be minted. 

Initially Baby Satoshi had a 8% distribution to holders but upon building a bigger liquidity pool has increased rewards to 11% for holders! So now you get even more BTC for holding baby Satoshi? 
 
Fee breakdown 11% automatically distributed to holders as BTC 4% automatically added to liquidity 3% marketing and development 

Contract: 0xa1d04a189f8b6d5d64e8fea7c38846ab6fa0f823

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,"Trump Wins, Bitcoin Soars: What It Means for Crypto","I‚Äôve been keeping a close eye on the markets since the U.S. election results came in, and let me tell you‚Äîthings are heating up. With Trump back in office, Bitcoin didn‚Äôt just nudge upward; it shot past $75,000, breaking records and signaling what could be the start of a new bullish wave.

¬†

Now, why is this happening? It‚Äôs all about market sentiment and expectations. Historically, Trump‚Äôs pro-business stance has been a boon for markets, and his administration has hinted at being more crypto-friendly. Investors are betting on reduced regulatory pressure, and the numbers speak for themselves. Bitcoin‚Äôs up 8%, and it‚Äôs pulling other coins like Ethereum and Solana along for the ride.

¬†

But here‚Äôs the thing: we‚Äôve seen this before. Bitcoin often leads the charge, and once it cools off, the momentum flows into altcoins. This is the natural flow of crypto market cycles. First, BTC rallies as the market‚Äôs anchor, drawing in institutional money. Then, as those gains level out, capital rotates into smaller, high-potential projects looking to ride the wave.

¬†

This isn‚Äôt just speculation‚Äîit‚Äôs a pattern we‚Äôve seen time and time again. And understanding it can help you position yourself to maximize gains.

¬†

**Why I‚Äôm Betting on Shogun**  
Here‚Äôs where it gets exciting for me. I‚Äôm invested in Shogun, and I see it as one of the projects perfectly positioned to ride the momentum from this BTC rally. Shogun operates on its own terms, built on strong fundamentals and a community that values honor and long-term growth.

¬†

Shogun isn‚Äôt just another token riding hype; it‚Äôs a dynamic ecosystem with real utility, including an upcoming DEX and developer tools. As BTC continues to pump and eventually stabilizes, I‚Äôm confident we‚Äôll see more attention flowing into solid altcoin projects like this one.

¬†

The market can be volatile, but if you understand the flow of money and stay calm during the noise, you‚Äôre already ahead of the game. For me, Shogun is that steady ship in the storm, ready to ride the next wave.

¬†

Are you ready to move with the market‚Äôs momentum? Let‚Äôs see where this next phase takes us.

üìé Whitepaper (English version) : https://m7capital.finance/file/white_papers/M7_White_Paper_EN.pdf


Why I'm bullish on M7:

üí≥M7 CAPITAL INVESTMENT PLATFORMüí≥

This platform will be a one-stop-shop for investors looking for safe and effective Dividend Yield Tokens, which we are dubbing Capital Asset Tokens or CATs, and what we believe will be revolutionary in the DeFi Vault space: our Capital Investment Vaults or CIVs.

These vaults will allow investors to stake our Capital Asset Tokens and compound their holdings, not by cannibalizing the Capital Asset Tokens themselves, but by using the dividends they generate to buy back and increase holdings. By pooling together funds from multiple investors, it will multiply the buying power and create a positive feedback loop of value.

üß∞M7 VAULT TOKEN (VAULT)üß∞

The first step, and a cornerstone one, is to officially launch the M7 Vault Token, the governance token. With the launch of our platform to launch immediately after the token, there will be no waiting around!
This is to us the main driver that will build the whole ecosystem of the M7 Capital Investment Platform.

üë®M7 TEAMüë®

The team is a dedicated and experienced team in creating high-yield tokens. The team has been involved in many fair launches in the past. Several of their token (GhostPumpers, Moonwalker, Saturday Night Elon...) did 1000x.

With their innovative approach, they were pioneers in the creation of dividend-yield token, thanks to Doge Back, the first token with dividend-yield paid in Dogecoin.

The team has consistently proven in every one of their projects that they are never out to scam, defraud or purposefully do harm to the community. Any time there were issues they were addressed with transparency (at times to a fault) and integrity.",1265,2021-08-25 22:59:45,16

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Missed BITCOIN ? Get $SATOSHI¬†!,"Bitcoin paved the way for a new era of finance. But you can‚Äôt be without knowing that Bitcoin is no decentralized anymore. Only a few wallets are possessing the majority of the asset. This is no more a ordinary people game. This is a government, hedge funds game.

This is why we saw a huge explosion of memecoins recently. And this is only the begining. Memecoins are a lot more than a joke. It is the next decentralization step to bring the game back to ordinary people. Memecoins are the vehicle for the original vision of the cryptocurency.

No doubt the majority of memecoins are trashcoins. A lot of people are chasing after green candles with the most short sighted vision. They are sniping, scalping, swinging, trading, jeeting and dumping irresponsibly for profits that will become losses on the next gamble.

You are smarter than that. All of this is like selling bitcoin ten years ago to buy a pizza. You surely have the reference.

Beyond these insignificant noises, some people are working to build true communities that are here to stay. It only requires one Satoshi to bring a revolution.

You are no more early on Bitcoin. But you are so early on true legit communities that have a brilliant future. Opportunities are everywhere everytime. They want you to focus on their game. It‚Äôs time to get your power and your sovereignty back.

$SATOSHI community can embrace the whole cryptospace. It‚Äôs the legacy of Bitcoin and Satoshi vision. It‚Äôs much more than a memecoin as it reunites memecoin, technology, vision, decentralization, store of value, artwork and community.

We are all Satoshi. This is the everlasting narrative. When people will wake up to this simple idea, the snowball effect will embrace catalyst after catalyst.

You are so lucky to be able to catch the train when it is still at the station instead of running behind.

Technically speaking, this is the most solid project that is still at this market cap under $2M. The ratio between the liquidity and the market cap is the best. It is a cross chain project on Eth, base and on sol soon. It has NFTs. It is here since a year. The community is very active by constantly raiding the socials and attending VC and spaces regularly.  
  
Last time we saw this kind of foundations, it was with SPX. It was flat during a long time before it exploded and reached nearly one billion. And it is still the beginning.

This narrative with such foundations¬†? No lie, I‚Äôm giving you an easy 1000x right now, even if this is not financial advice.

This kind of project takes time. Remember Shiba. Remember DOGE. The DOGE Founder sold all his coins to buy a car some years ago. Those coins were worth 45 millions $ few time later. Please, when you are sitting on a gem, hold it¬†!

People are in a hurry. We are living in a world that goes faster and faster. Easy money right now, that‚Äôs what all people want¬†! When lambo¬†? When moon¬†? When CEX¬†? When when when¬†?

You surely already have it. But you may not see it. It is so big in front of you¬†!

So here it is again in a very simple way.

Don‚Äôt miss out this brand new BSC project to be officially launched on 30th August!

üöÄFirst step: launch of the M7 Vault Token (M7 VAULT), the governance token for the M7 Capital Investment Platform

üí≥M7 CAPITAL INVESTMENT PLATFORMüí≥

This platform will be a one-stop-shop for investors looking for safe and effective Dividend Yield Tokens, which we are dubbing Capital Asset Tokens or CATs, and what we believe will be revolutionary in the DeFi Vault space: our Capital Investment Vaults or CIVs.

These vaults will allow investors to stake our Capital Asset Tokens and compound their holdings, not by cannibalizing the Capital Asset Tokens themselves, but by using the dividends they generate to buy back and increase holdings. By pooling together funds from multiple investors, it will multiply the buying power and create a positive feedback loop of value.

üß∞M7 VAULT TOKEN (VAULT)üß∞

The first step, and a cornerstone one, is to officially launch the M7 Vault Token on 30th August, the governance token.
This is to us the main driver that will build the whole ecosystem of the M7 Capital Investment Platform.

üë®M7 TEAMüë®

The team is dedicated and experienced in creating high-yield tokens. The team has been involved in many fair launches in the past. Several of their token (GhostPumpers, Moonwalker, Saturday Night Elon...) did 1000x. 

With their innovative approach, they were pioneers in the creation of dividend-yield token, thanks to Doge Back, the first token with dividend-yield paid in Dogecoin.

The team has consistently proven in every one of their projects that they are never out to scam, defraud or purposefully do harm to the community. Any time there were issues they were addressed with transparency (at times to a fault) and integrity.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,$TTC | The real Bitcoin | Leading the space | TITCOIN,"Fifteen years ago, on August 21, 2009, the legendary Satoshi Nakamoto considered a name that could have turned the world of cryptocurrencies upside down‚Äî**Titcoin**! Yes, you read that right. In a playful email exchange with Martti Malmi, Satoshi humorously suggested that ""Titcoin"" might attract more attention due to its cheeky and fun name. 

In fact, he was serious enough about the idea that he even secured the domain Titcoin.org, just in case the world was ready for a cryptocurrency with a bit more‚Ä¶ personality. Imagine how different the landscape might be today if Bitcoin was called Titcoin. Would we still have the same respect for this revolutionary technology? Or would the crypto space have taken on a completely different tone?

It‚Äôs moments like these that remind us how history can pivot on the smallest of decisions. While Bitcoin has become synonymous with digital gold and financial revolution, it‚Äôs amusing to think that we were just one humorous idea away from a very different kind of crypto revolution.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,SafeBitcoin is a low market cap gem with huge plans for the future. Don't miss out on this potential moonshot! - more info about SafeBitcoin below.,"Cryptocurrencies have taken the world and its financial ecosystem by storm. Call it the revolution of the 21st century if you wish; that is exactly what it is. This new technology, generated by Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs idea, has many facets such as smart contracts, blockchains, peer-to-peer, mining, trading, and more. It has become the game-changer in the world of financial transactions.

**SafeBitcoin overview:**  
The air is already saturated with excitement and its community is growing fast. We welcome you to the world of SafeBTC, a combination of profitable yield-generating DeFi and safe store-of-value Bitcoin. There is no doubt that both ‚Äúworlds‚Äù have offered disrupting possibilities. Their impact cannot be emphasized well enough as they have given the cryptocurrency ecosystem a reason to live and thrive and as of today, surpass the 2T market cap globally. It is a pleasure to introduce this life-changing-opportunity token. The aim is to be at the forefront of wealth generation and a better and fairer economic standard of living. SafeBTC is a deflationary token allowing passive income generation. The first juicy feature is a ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù applied to transactions. This penalty increases the liquidity, reduces the supply and rewards token holders. Here‚Äôs how it works; 4% on each transaction is split instantly among token holders and the liquidity pool, reducing supply. This arrangement eradicates the worries of gas fee friction when farming tokens. SafeBTC community is all about rewards and wealth creation. The system has a distribution on every transaction completed, with 2% locked in liquidity and burned forever and another 2% is redistributed to token holders as reward.

&#x200B;

**- Now proudly on both BSC & ETH -**

After amassing over 200,000 holders on BSC, we are launched on ETH.

We wanted to disrupt the status quo and set ourselves apart from ordinary DeFi tokens that pop out everyday.

We are frictionless, yield generating, safe & audited. Earn interests by holding #SafeBTC on both BSC & ETH.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,$BTC | Top 5 reasons to buy Bitcoins on Solana + 8M BTC Giveaway,"Hey everyone!

Are you tired of just owning a fraction of a Bitcoin and feeling left out of the whale club? Well, do I have some news for you. Bitcoin on Solana ($BTC) lets you own 1 million bitcoins for just under $11 USD.

Sure, we're under a $10k market cap, but hear me out... here are some solid reasons to buy in:

1. **Clout and prestige:** the BTC balance in your Solana wallet is almost indistinguishable from the real thing. Use this to gain entry into the most exclusive events, test drive luxury cars and hang with the upper echelon of society.
2. **Practice Your Diamond Hands:** Train yourself to hold during market crashes without any real financial pain ‚Äî it's like Bitcoin on training wheels!
3. **The Culture:** the $BTC community on Telegram consists of the most cultured members from communities such as $HEGE, $CTHULHU, $NANCYCOIN & $BOMBO. They are in it for the unlimited LARPing potential (it's like stepping back to 2009).
4. **Literally Unruggable:** I know this gets thrown around a lot, but it's now over 19 days since $BTC graduated the pump fun trenches and launched on Raydium. If it was a rug, it would have happened by now. The dev holds less than 3% of supply, which is barely enough to make a dent.
5. **More satisfying than building the LEGO¬Æ Harry Potter set:** building a blockchain is infinitely more satisfying (and affordable than playing with those those plastic blocks.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,"Bitcoin is Recovering, Established Crypto Projects like VoteDoge are Proving Their Staying Power¬†","The crypto market always has been a roller coaster, and it is not just the big names that make waves.

Early October, Bitcoin dipped below $61K, shaking the market by surprise before bouncing back to $64K now. Predictions for a rally to $70K by Halloween are circulating once again and building hope for a good crypto rally. But while Bitcoin is drawing attention, seasoned investors know that the real value and best opportunities often lie in older, established projects like VoteDoge. Projects that have have seen both the highs and lows of the volatile crypto market.



Older projects that have stood the test of time‚Äîlike VoteDoge ‚Äîare proving their resilience. Unlike new projects, that can quickly disappear due to poor management or outright scams, established memecoins have not only survived time but also continued to build momentum through consistent innovation, community engagement, and strategic initiatives. VoteDoge has build a strong, convinced community that hold their bag and is determined and convinced of the opportunity and future success of this unique memecoin.



Despite the volatility in memecoins and lower¬† momentum around them compared to 6 months ago, VoteDoge has maintained its floor. The team is creating an updated plan and roadmap. rolled out new features, like an animation series, that keeps the community engaged and excited. Projects like VoteDoge have already gone through their growing pains, making them a safer bet than new coins that can be prone to rug pulls or collapse shortly after launch.



The key to long-term success in crypto isn‚Äôt just about quick gains but about stability, growth, and real-world utility‚Äîall of which VoteDoge embodies. When looking for your next move and crypto investment, it might be worth considering projects that have already proven¬† that they can stand their ground through thick and thin like VoteDoge.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,"Crypto game studio is rolling out $Shinobiverse turning their talents skywards. Shinobiverse now live on Yahoo Finance. With a presale of 3.2M dollars, making it the biggest gaming presale on Cronos network.","Shinobi features a blockchain-based NFT economy and marketplace. It was invented by Final Film, a blockchain games studio. Shinobiverse P2E game can be compared to some degree to Pok√©mon, in that there are characters in the form of NFTs. Players pit their characters against another fighter‚Äôs NFT, and the winner receives coins that can be used to unlock power upgrades, which make the fighter-character more likely to win. But here‚Äôs the thing: the coins are actually crypto tokens. These can gain value in the same way Bitcoin or Ethereum can, and players can cash in their earnings to use in the real world.

The Shinobiverse P2E game does exactly what it says on the tin: players are rewarded with cold hard cryptocurrency for winning battles and/or completing tasks within the game.

The makers take you into the world of Shinobiverse, a world where you work your way up ‚Äì a world where only the strongest and smartest players survive. Each era has its own unique gangs, and users can sign up to take advantage of the benefits that these groups bring. Shinobiverse is an action-adventure game where participants play real-life scenarios and complete missions to progress through the story.

**Cronos Blockchain x Polygon Network**

Shinobi is a decentralized and tokenized Unreal Engine/Unity gaming platform built on Cronos Chain. 

Cronos Chain is a brand new public, opensource and permissionless blockchain-a fully decentralized Game-Fi network with high speed and low fees. Ethermint is the underlying technology that Cronos is built on. Ethermint is a high-throughput, scalable Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain. The Cosmos SDK, which operates on top of the Tendermint Core consensus engine, was used to create it. Polygon is a well-established framework preferred by many decentralized applications and Game-Fi projects, bringing innovative gamification to the rapidly growing Web3 and metaverse economies. 

The Shinobi Game Ecosystem consists of a dual token economy, based on a Cronos Chain bridge with Polygon Network and uses NFT collectables. NFT items, such as vehicles, property and companies, are used by players to progress through the game. Players can trade, rent or sell them to gain profit.

**Team**

The team is unified by a mission to build the ultimate game, Shinobi has a team of highly experienced full-stack, blockchain and game developers, as well as UI, VR, content and 3D designers. 

**NFT Marketplace** 

In the NFT Marketplace, players and non-players can buy, sell, auction, exchange and rent out NFT items, which are regularly available in limited numbers and editions. Additionally, players can use NFT items in-game and sell rent or exchange them to other players. Players are also able to sell their account. Every SHINO Token holder is eligible to receive SHINO tokens which are redistributed from token transaction fees.

**Final thoughts**

**Shinobiverse offers gamers all over the world a thrilling new experience in the form of a real-life roleplay game in which participants can earn crypto currency while playing.** It has a marketplace where players can easily convert their NFTs and tokens to real-world values.

**This year is looking like an extremely exiting one for Unreal Engine/Unity fans of P2E and tactical gaming.**

This is the first in person convention for any crypto since the beginning of the pandemic. There will be a lot of news coverage on it and a lot of big names there! They're hinting that there's a bigger surprise that's coming!

So here's the catalysts for the upcoming 7 days:

-Nascar Driver Keith McGee deploys his social media marketing and conventional media advertisements (Fox, ESPN, ETC)-Deploy advertisements across Miami covering all areas of the 2021 Bitcoin Convention in the 4th, 5th and 6th.

-First donation. This solidifies this project. This project is so new they have yet to do their first donation to the heart of a lion foundation for veterans.

-CMC Listing.

-Fox news interview that Keith McGee recorded today airs sometime this week, no later than Tuesday, according to the Devs

-Devs said they were invited to the conference and heading down that way. Now why would they go? They accomplished all of this within a week, I'm sure they have something cool coming up. They're tight lipped about it though and only will hint that there's more to come.
-The Telegram is FILLED with exchanges asking mods to list them. It's just a matter of time.

This project has the right people making the right moves. They have done this in just a few days, it is insane. Take a look for yourself.

The amount of news, press and events are all happening at once and something tells me they are just getting started.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,20th August 2009 : how to make 1m Bitcoin,"Journal Entry: August 20, 2009

Another day in 2009, and things are getting even crazier. Thanks to our time machine, we‚Äôre still riding the wave of early Bitcoin. The market cap is hovering around 17k, and nobody here realizes the goldmine they‚Äôre sitting on. Dr. Raydium has been a huge help ‚Äî he got us a deal with Mt. Gox, and now we‚Äôre all sitting on stacks of Bitcoin.

This week we joined the history books by buying some pizza with Bitcoin, just like that legendary transaction. Thinking about it, maybe that legendary transaction has always been us, coming back from the future. 
It feels unreal to be part of this moment. But here‚Äôs the cool part‚Äîwe‚Äôre not keeping all the fun to ourselves. We‚Äôre spreading the love and making sure others can get in on this early too. 

If you‚Äôre reading this and want to jump back to 2009 with us, now‚Äôs your chance. We‚Äôve got something special running until August 23rd. 
Just tune into the space-time frequency on our future Twitter (or is it already X?) channel @BTCBeforeSol, and you might find yourself walking away with a piece of history. 1m Bitcoin, maybe enough to buy pizza!

Time is ticking! You can find us on 6QSV7Pq7VSFkXGqmUXwCPhUN8vBtWkXUup9BMfSfpump

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,üöÄÔΩúLendefi FinanceÔΩúTestnet Launched - Canary Mainnet Coming End Of August On BSCÔΩúLeveraged Trading & Undercollateralized LoansÔΩúSmall Market Cap ÔΩú üöÄ,"Lendefi allows traders to access funds for leveraged trading through undercollateralized loans. The protocol delivers a professional solution that provides an important service to cryptocurrency markets. The testnet is launched and the Canary mainnet is coming at the end of August on the Binance Smart Chain.

With its current low market cap $LDFI, this is a good chance for a moonshot!

**Lendefi Finance**

Lendefi‚Äôs protocol offers value to both parties in the lending equation. Traders can access funds for leveraged trading through undercollateralized loans. The lending pool generates interest payments from loans to traders. Trades and loans are secured by the Lendefi protocol within a trustless transaction.

Lendefi recently launched its testnet on the Binance Smart Chain and the Canary mainnet launch is coming at the end of the month! Following the mainnet launch, Lendefi will transition its management structure into a DAO, which will bring additional value to owners of LDFI tokens.

In the runup towards mainnet launch, Lendefi has marketing initiatives planned to raise awareness of Lendefi‚Äôs native LDFI tokens and the value of leveraged trading. There are significant opportunities for Lendefi to grow. One of only two competitors in the sector is Aave which only offers over collateralized loans, so traders need to invest more than they borrow. Lendefi solves this problem with secured undercollateralized loans for leveraged trading!

Lendefi is a low market cap token with an important value proposition that is about to launch its Canary mainnet!

**Value Proposition**

* Testnet launched
* Canary mainnet end of August
* Audited
* Doxxed management and developers
* Valuable use case

**Lendefi In The News**

* BitcoinDaily
* Coinomi
* HashNews
* CoinPogo
* Unblokkt

**Lendefi** **Tokenomics**

Lendefi‚Äôs Tokenomics are listed on their GitBook page:

[https://lendefi.gitbook.io/lendefi-finance/tokenomics](https://lendefi.gitbook.io/lendefi-finance/tokenomics)

Lendefi charges fees on trading which are used to purchase LDFI tokens for rewards and burning. Burning lowers the total and circulating supply and improves the value for token holders. Rewards will include Staking, Liquidation, Yield Farming and Liquidity rewards.

When there are so many projects that make fake tokens. and many of you were deceived and also lost your money. Bitcoin Maxis comes with a Defi Gore system based on the BSC blockchain where this token will be built under the hands and decisions of the community.

&#x200B;

The ever growing liquidity pool will grow 10x faster than what it would with just our liquidity fee added onto our Tx tax and this will bridge the gap between MC and LP to prevent anyone from being left 'holding the bags'

&#x200B;

We are working hard to make this a long term sustainable token and now is your chance to get your bags at the lowest price you'll likely ever get them again due to our current marketing campaign.

&#x200B;

Our goal is to create a safe place, so much needed these days, for people like us. A place where you can trust people, where no rug pulls happen and where you can have a chance to invest in a solid project and community often. Where you not only invest in a token and it's project, but the people behind that token as well.

&#x200B;

DYOR!

You can check the contract carefully before investing, we have done our part!! We want to grow this Community and make it strong.",521,2021-06-25 03:00:06,33

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,$SOLBTC - Bitcoin‚Äôs Scarcity Meets Solana‚Äôs Speed  | 21M Hard Cap | First 11M Circulating,"What‚Äôs $SOLBTC? Think BTC scarcity model, but with the speed and low fees of Solana. **$SOLBTC** has a fixed supply of **21 million tokens**, inspired by Bitcoin‚Äôs hard cap, making it a rarity on the Solana network. Currently, **11,000,000 $SOLBTC are circulating**, with the remaining **10,000,000 to be released in two epochs of 5,000,000 each** ‚Äî setting up controlled growth for maximum stability. With fast, low-cost transactions, this token is built for adoption. ‚ö°

# üåü Why $SOLBTC?

* **Scarcity**
* **Accessible on Solana**
* **Early Opportunity**

# üìà Market Potential

If $SOLBTC even scratches a fraction of BTC‚Äôs appeal on Solana‚Äôs chain, that‚Äôs a massive upside! üöÄ The remaining release phases are planned to keep interest high while stabilizing supply over time. üìä

**TL;DR for the Newcomers**: $SOLBTC combines Bitcoin‚Äôs capped supply model with the fast, low-fee Solana network. This BTC-inspired scarcity model on Solana could be the low-cap gem you've been looking for, especially with only 11M circulating so far.

The goal? 
Stack Bitcoin while it‚Äôs still pennies and rewrite history as we know it. 
Dr. Raydium, representative of Mt. Gox, is leading the charge, helping us navigate this wild frontier. We‚Äôre out here mining, buying pizza with BTC, and getting ahead of the curve before anyone else even knows what Bitcoin is. 

Imagine knowing the future, seeing how Bitcoin revolutionizes the world, and then getting the chance to go back and secure your own slice of that pie. That‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre doing‚Äîliving the early days all over again, but this time with the knowledge of what‚Äôs to come. We‚Äôre not just players in this story; we‚Äôre writing it.

---

Now, stepping back from the LARP for a moment, here‚Äôs the real deal. **Bitcoin (BTC)** is a new LARP-driven memecoin launched on Raydium, where we‚Äôre creating a narrative of traveling back to 2009 to buy Bitcoin at launch. What started as a fun concept among a small group of degens has exploded into a rapidly growing community. We‚Äôre 135 members strong, with 50 new members joining just today. And the growth isn‚Äôt slowing down‚Äîmore and more people are jumping on board, drawn by the unique blend of nostalgia and innovation.

Our community is 100% organic‚Äîno paid shills, no bots, just people who love the story and want to be part of something truly different. Whether you‚Äôre in it for the LARP or the potential gains, this project is all about community, fun, and reliving the magic of Bitcoin‚Äôs early days in a way that‚Äôs never been done before.

They work as one and continue to impress

They‚Äôre also making the world a better place. They have sponsored two Nigerian youth soccer teams and will have new gear/jerseys sent to them soon. 

They‚Äôre sending a team to Antarctica to plant a flag for harrypotterobamasonic10inu 

Honestly though, this token is the endgame.

It's the shitcoin of shitcoins.

Imagine telling your coworkers you're quitting because harrypotterobamasonic10inu coin mooned?

Imagine the media reporting on harrypotterobamasonic10inu breaking 1bn marketcap. Or the idiot normies buying along the way because they typed BITCOIN into Uniswap.

This is the first coin that has enticed me to join the Shitcoin casino.

It's just another shitcoin, sure, but at least this one shines a spotlight directly onto the stupidity that is the degen coin/ETH casino/dogcoin market trend.

It's self aware. They're renting billboards in Calcutta for fucks sake. This is THE /biz/ shitcoin.

12M marketcap. Don't cry when it breaks 1b market cap because you missed it. You've seen it happen time and time again with Shiba and now Pepe reskinned shit.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,"‚ÄºÔ∏èSafemoon Cash [$25 mill market cap] attended BITCOIN MIAMI 2021! [7 weeks old] - Big updates: Safemoon Cash Swap THIS Thursday! Listed on Hotbit, Bibox, Probit, XT.com, worldwide marketing campaign kicking off, and much more. Missed Safemoon? Here is your chance for life-changing money!‚ÄºÔ∏è","Safemoon Cash is a 100% community-driven project is just 7 weeks old. I'm convinced this is your chance to join a strong, loving community that will only grow! Let me start with some beautiful stats: 


* 230k+ holders
* 25M MC
* 50k+ members in SMC‚Äôs Telegram group
* 50k+ Twitter followers, millions of Tweet impressions
* 13k+ TikTok followers
* 10k+ Instagram followers
* Growing Discord Members 


The most important part: you are still early! For peace of thought, are we on CG? Yes. How about CMC? Of course! 


CMC is always a huge trigger for any project but will continue be even more so for Safemoon Cash. The original Safemoon has been the most searched for crypto for weeks now on CMC. We are right up there when people search ‚Äòsafemoon‚Äôüòâ 

---------------------------------


So what is Safemoon Cash? 

Safemoon Cash is, in short, a rug-proof, ownership-renounced, 100% community-driven project that will, inspired by Safemoon, bring a multitude of use cases to the world of crypto. Bitcoin Cash reached an ATH of 0.25 Bitcoin. The first goal is for Safemoon Cash to reach 25% of Safemoon‚Äôs peak market capitalization. 


---------------------------


So why is Safemoon Cash different than Safemoon? 

First of all: it is totally rug proof and community-driven. Nobody 'owns it', as ownership of the smart contract has been renounced and they can't touch their LP. Safemoon has a manual LP and Safemoon Cash has an auto-LP. Also, their tokenomics are superior to those of Safemoon. With its high transaction tax, it‚Äôs the early holders of Safemoon that profit most. Every Safemoon Cash transaction incurs a 4% tax to the benefit of all. Safemoon Cash gives holders passive rewards (2%) through static reflection. 2% of each transaction is locked away in the Safemoon Cash liquidity pool, to create a steadily rising price floor. Safemoon Cash burned the liquidity after launching the token. 

----------------------------


What has Safemoon Cash been up to today and what's coming? 

‚úÖ Hired an external Market Making company as we are getting listed on more and more exchanges. More volume is more new investors! 


üìë Negotiations with a huge multibillion exchange are ongoing

Safemoon Cash will within days introduce the Safemoon Cash Swap function on their website and within the next few weeks introduce the Safemoon Cash Governance token (SMCG) and the Safemoon Cash Governance interface. SMCG holders, the community, can help shape the future of Safemoon Cash by influencing decisions concerning the project, such as proposing or deciding on new feature proposals (i.e. roadmap, hiring and staffing, charities, changes to governance parameters). Additionally, Safemoon Cash will introduce a yield farming protocol. It will be possible to farm the Safemoon Cash Governance token using Safemoon Cash. 

This will lock up Safemoon Cash, thus decreasing selling pressure and increasing liquidity. 

For a more comprehensive idea about the project and further use cases currently under development, have a look at their moonmap (roadmap) on their website!

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Bitcoin time travel journal : 19 august 2009,"Journal Entry: August 19, 2009 

It's been 5 days we're in 2009. 

Today I decided to start a daily journal to tell the future what's been happening back here. I don't know if you will be able to see this, nor where it'll be shared. It's intended to be on Reddit, but who knows if Reddit will still exist once you read this. 

We travelled back to 2009 thanks to the Pumpfun time machine built by Dr. Ray. He charged it with nuclear elements, specially Raydium, in order to give us the jump needed to break the space and time barrier. 

Things are wild here. 

We've linked up again with Ray who secured us a deal with Mt. Gox. Bitcoin is finally capitalised. We're grabbing as much of it as we can while it's still flying under the radar. Can you imagine, buying bitcoin at 13k market cap? 

Today, we actually bought pizza with Bitcoin how crazy is that? It's hard to believe people used to think this stuff was worthless. We're basically living the early days of Bitcoin all over again, with none of the stress about the future. 

And the best part? You can join us. 

Just follow our encrypted key to space-time instructions:
 6QSV7Pq7VSFkXGqmUXwCPhUN8vBtWkXUup9BMfSfpump 

and you'll be here with us, stacking Bitcoin before everyone else realizes its potential. More updates soon.",6,2024-08-19 13:00:12,6
BTC,CryptoMoonShots,The next bitcoin - $BNBTC - Halving is in 14 hrs from now- BSC- PoW - Store of value,"I'm a smooth brained ape who has started off in the space buying into various Pump/dump scammy tokens, so my philosophy into investing has now shifted to searching for coins that are SCARCE and ones I can build LEVERAGE. I was too young to buy BTC, so my smooth brain has reasoned I needed to find another like it.

BNBTC is the first BEP20 Proof-of-Work pure-mined cryptocurrency native to the Binance BNB Smart Chain (BSC). 21M tokens solely distributed through Proof-of-Work mining over the next several decades. No ICO. No airdrop. No pre-mine. Trustless, permissionless, decentralized.¬†

I've started buying at 1 cent back in January 2023. I think this is a sleeping giant.

I believe tomorrow will be a massive pump, and even though the price might increase by 4-5x, it's just the beginning. The roadmap is insane, and we're only in Phase 1. There are still 3 more phases to come.

If you're looking for a long-term investment with the potential for much higher returns than 4-5x, join our community. The team has some exciting plans to further accelerate our growth, but we need more members to make it happen.

I recommend, of course, that you DYOR. But in any case, I‚Äôm telling you about a project to add to your watchlist you might be surprised by our rise in the coming months.

First halving in 14 hrs from now.

Up 160% in one day.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,HPOS10I Ticker $bitcoin - Has Some Serious Legs,"I've never come across such a dedicated team of meme makers, developers, or anything of the like the same as HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu. Originally it was launched on BSC with a 10% tax, last week the devs relaunched on Ethereum. $bitcoin on Ethereum had a better ring to it anyways. With a solid history in the meme-sphere as well as fresh ones being baked every day I've truly never laughed as hard as this with any project.  
There's thousands of memecoin variants that have spurred out of the pepe run, but every one nearly turned out to be a p+d or scam entirely trying to capitalize on it's success. This one is different, original and has built quite a lore building for itself already. From the ticker $bitcoin being shadow banned (old twitter rules) to the official acct being unsearchable it's been an uphill battle for this project but it's been grinding it's way onto the Dextools charts as well as Twitter every single day this week. Each day it's growing organically, no bots, completely influencer free. Most of the tg chat doesn't even have reddit accounts, hence I am here. Thank you for your time and patience.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,$BTC - Solana‚Äôs first LARP driven memecoin with 1000x potential - transporting you back to 2009 and the genesis of Bitcoin,"Bitcoin ($BTC) is the first LARP driven memecoin on the Soland blockchain, transporting you back to Satoshi's 2009 inner circle, giving you another chance to become an early adopter and buy some pizza for bitcoins.

Join the TG to find out how you can help build this new peer-to-peer cash system, and relive real world events around the time of Bitcoin's genesis.

Bitcoin ($BTC) made it out of the pump.fun trenches organically and has an active and passionate community and team. The current market cap is only $22k, which means huge upside potential. At today‚Äôs prices 1 SOL = over 6 million bitcoins! You could be set for life.

Project Abstract:

A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer cash network, with ""blocks"" of transactions recorded on an infinite chain, kind of like Lego¬Æ!

Imagine you and your friends are building a tower with Legos, and you all have to agree on the exact same way to add new pieces to the tower. Every time someone wants to add a Lego, they show it to everyone, and if it fits the rules, it gets added. Bitcoin works like that! The Legos are like tiny pieces of digital money, and everyone in the world can see the tower, so no one can cheat by adding fake pieces. This way, everyone trusts the tower because it's built step-by-step, with everyone agreeing on each piece!

Join the community and help build this Lego tower:

üî•Week 3 - After week 2, we will begin our PR campaign which will consist of articles on large websites to drive constant traffic to our chart, website and overall brand.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,LUNA INU ($LINU) - Continued Growth and Updates: The Best Low MC Ahead of Bitcoin Halving?,"Hello again, I'm back with an update on the journey of **$LINU**, which I last discussed at the end of January. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/s/ZAa9IxkdCS](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/s/ZAa9IxkdCS)

Since then, the LINU community has been thriving, adding over 1,500 new holders, a steady 50+ a day.

Significantly, LINU‚Äôs market capitalisation remains under 3 million, offering a potential high-reward opportunity.

From a strategic growth perspective, LINU has applied for listing on **Gate.io** and is in talks. It is understood LINU has been accepted and they are doing their final volume checks. 
Additionally, applications to eight other CEXs are complete with many accepting LINU, and the community now raising funds to pay for listings. 
The community is in the process of setting up a multisig wallet specifically for handling listings, showcasing their organised approach.

Excitingly, LINU is set to launch its NFT collection this week on **Valentine‚Äôs Day (14th February)**, accompanied by high-quality video promotions, further cementing its presence in the digital asset space. The funds from these sales will be used to pay for the accepted listings. 
There also community engagement competitions to help foster the projects growth.

A notable event this week was the downfall of a notorious E193 wallet, known for its swing trading, which spectacularly failed, they sold 11T and bought a proper shitcoin - CAPY and then immediately lost 30% value while new LINU investors bought in, creating a loss of around 50% for the swing trader.

A unique aspect of LINU is its development; while there are no official developers, community leaders have remarkably stepped up. Their engaging video content is a must-watch for anyone interested in the token‚Äôs grassroots movement. This community-driven approach has kept LINU consistently in Coinbase wallet‚Äôs top trending list. Moreover, the wallet distribution has improved even further than it was before, and it was great anyway! - adding an extra layer of stability to this already promising memecoin.

In real-world applications, LINU has crossed a significant milestone with Texas CBD businesses starting to accept it as a currency. This move towards practical utility is a promising sign for its future.

The buzz around LINU isn‚Äôt just limited to trading platforms. A notable TikTok account has begun advocating for LINU and it‚Äôs already had hundreds of thousands of views.

Moreover, the community has launched a new website and set up LINU Radio, expanding its digital footprint.

Lastly, LINU has started hosting AMA sessions, a great initiative for fostering transparency and community engagement.

To sum up, LINU is shaping up to be more than just a memecoin, and as an OG Shib investor LINU is really on the same trajectory. I‚Äôm keen to hear your thoughts and experience on this one.

Does this look like a good investment, even if high risk? Given the absolute degenerative nature 99% of memecoins have, this one just seems to sit out as something that with enough exposure would be huge.",39,2024-02-11 08:49:55,18
BTC,CryptoMoonShots,BabyCrypto: a Auto Yield Generating Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. Simply hold your BabyCrypto in your wallet and earn Bitcoin.,"Stealth launched into the bustling world of crypto among the newest generation of DeFi meme tokens, BabyCrypto brings BTC rewards as part of its automated Tokenomics. Simply hold BabyCrypto in your wallet, and earn BTC rewards automatically from each transaction.

Here's the tokenomics breakdown:

Slippage: 10% buy / 15% sell

- 3% reflected to holders as BTC rewards

- 3% reflected to marketing/development

- 2% invested back into itself (auto buy-back)

- 1% added to liquidity

- 1% given to charity for children's hospitals around the globe

Anti-Whale and Anti-Dump Features

- 15%+ slippage fee for selling

- Max 1% of total token supply (10000 
BabyCrypto) allowed when buying or selling

While this healthy baby is rooted into the ever growing standard DeFi cryptocurrency scene with its own unique tokenomics, its total token supply is reinforced with a steadfast 90% liquidity foundation that is locked and burned forever.

BabyCrypto isn't some simple meme token either. On top of the tokenomics that gives 3% BTC back as reflection just for holding it, that auto locks even more liquidity per transaction, that keeps the developer paid, and that keeps the marketing budget flowing, investors can look forward to their BabyCrypto gaining more value with its planned features and utilities.


The roadmap says it all, starting with Phase II - BabyMarketCap, BabyChart, BabyVote & Ads. Then Phase III will bring arcade games that give BabyCrypto rewards, BabyCasino for crypto gambling, a multi-chain iOS/Android wallet, BabyFarm, and BabyCrypto Dex Exchange.


BabyCrypto is an Auto Yield Generating Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. It's built with the investor's interest in mind while it happily gives back to children around the world through charity! How can you not love this baby!

What is it:  BTCA allows you to send and receive transactions anonymously.  Similar to Tornado network, but they started out on ETH so they have been around for awhile.  They just completed the migration to BSC and literally launched 5 minutes ago.  Currently there are only 10 holders as of me writing this post.  

There isn't really much else to say honestly.  Project that has been around for awhile on ETH so they're not new to the scene and sending anonymously is becoming more and more of a hot trend so this combined with the fact that it's usually cheaper on bsc means and the extremely low mcap means that this is pretty much a guaranteed moon. 
 
I personally bought in at 27800 BTCA for 1BNB.",79,2021-04-02 23:23:35,90
BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Why Bitcoin‚ÄØIs Dumping?,"Why Bitcoin‚ÄØIs Dumping?

1) In historical Bitcoin market cycle, 
BTC always corrects after the halving.

So we are now seeing correcting and 
price consolidation after a massive 
pump from $15k to $73k

2) GDP came lower than expected 

Just an hour ago, US GDP projections came at 1.6% while the expectations were of 2.5%

Low GDP data ignites fear of recession which dumped S&P 500, NASDAQ and crypto

3) Biden tax proposal 

Yesterday, Biden proposed the highest capital gains tax in history at 44.6%.

His proposal also includes a 25% tax on unrealized gains for high-net-worth individuals.

In the past, whenever there is such a proposal the market has dumped and the similar thing is happening now

4) Israel situation 

Yesterday, Israel struck 40 Hezbollah sites in South Lebanon

As usual, Bitcoin started pricing in a war again which resulted in immediate dump

What's next for the market?

Low GDP numbers are actually bullish for the market as it will push the FED to do rate cuts

After the recent inflation data, it was expected that the rate cuts could be delayed but with the GDP numbers, the probability of rate cuts will increase again

IMO, BTC support at $60K is still very strong with a lot of buy orders

If there's a black swan event, BTC could go lower a bit more which will be a golden buying opportunity.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,$CONE - Best memecoin on reddit! Why buy Bitcoin when you can buy Bitcone?,"
What is BitCone ($CONE)?

BitCone (CONE) is a Decentralized Community Utility Token made by Cones, for Cones. 608 Billion tokens were created on the Polygon Network (with no mint function) to parallel the 608 Cone Head - Reddit Collectible Avatar NFT, that inspired a meme Conemunity. 

BitCone is governed democratically, so every decision is voted on via Conemunity Polls. 

BitCones can be earned through Airdrops and ""BitCone Mining"", a revolutionary automated content monetization platform, that incentivizes user engagement on partnered Subreddits.

What can Bitcone be used for?

- Post 2 Earn - BitCone Mining, rewarding engagement with CONE Tokens
- Tipping on Reddit.com/r/ConeHeads and other Subreddits
- Trading Reddit NFT Avatars on the AvatarMate.xyz Avatar Marketplace
- Earning Liquidity Rewards
- Minting NFT with CONE Tokens
- Bidding on Auctions with CONE Tokens


How many CONE tokens are there in circulation?

CONE was deployed on the Polygon Network on September 20th 2022, with 608 billion CONE tokens, created to parallel the 608 Cone Head - Reddit Collectible Avatar NFT that inspired it. 

There is no mint function in the CONE Smart Contract, so there can never be more than 608 billion BitCone.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Hyper Rail Gaming token 100k mcap = retirement coin,"Gaming token 100k mcap = pension coinüí∞

&#x200B;

NFT and gamify projects are booming! I‚Äôd like to share with you a new community project called Hyperrail. I‚Äôve got my eye on this particular project mainly because the NFT gamify space offers a lot of room to grow, the devs are doxxed, they‚Äôre working on a VR-game with real-life use case and the token has been launched less than 24 hours ago so your still super early. 

&#x200B;

üöÑSo what is HyperRail?üöÑ

HyperRail is a next-gen Autonomous Yield and Liquidity Generation Protocol, and the ecosystem of the VR NFT GAMING platform. 

The website contains all the information you need and has some sick art too, go check it out!: [https://hyperrail.finance/](https://hyperrail.finance/)

Litepaper: [https://pdfhost.io/v/9dwWX2lwy\_HR\_OPV3e.pdf](https://pdfhost.io/v/9dwWX2lwy_HR_OPV3e.pdf)

&#x200B;

üíéNew video of the closed Beta VR-game they‚Äôre working on: [https://youtu.be/Gi8kHf6uwaküíé](https://youtu.be/Gi8kHf6uwaküíé)

&#x200B;

The tokenomicsüí∞

Hyperrail has chosen the same path as its grand predecessor Bitcoin. Unlike most of the new shit- or hypecoins, they‚Äôre looking for a long prosperous project, just like Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned, with its exact tokenomics 21,000,000.

On top of that $HyRail holders will pay a fee if they want to close a sell order. This fee will go towards the ‚Äòbuyback wallet‚Äô and that will be used to boost up the buying pressure! Making the odds of tripling your investment even higher. 

&#x200B;

Max supply: 21,000,000üí∏

Public sale: 87%

5% Team / 5% Marketing / 3% Community

&#x200B;

Taxes:üöÑ

7% buyback a more tactical way of LP tokens bought are burned.

2% community fee for improving the Hyper Rail ecosystem

9% total tax üê≥ friendly

&#x200B;

The safeties you ask? ‚úÖ

 \-Both founders openly doxxed and at the previous project (which did a x230 in the first 24hrs)

\-Daily voice chats & weekly AMA‚Äôs. next AMA 19:30 GMT 14th of august 2021

\-Very active community contributing in all kinds of promotional activities. 

\-Liquidity is locked and community managed

\-Large buyback wallet to encourage buying force.

\-The token is 100% Community governed! making every member count.

\-Fair public launch with anti-bot pre-cautions taken.  

&#x200B;

The communityüéñ

Hyperrail is a community project. Therefore I would highly advice you to join the Telegram group: [t.me/hyperrail](https://t.me/hyperrail) and Discord server: [https://discord.gg/4Axkt3jU](https://discord.gg/4Axkt3jU) to participate in all the promotional activities. The community is very active and the chat is being monitored 24/7 by mods in order to maintain a good atmosphere. Join in to find out more! All members will help you to find and understand things better. 

&#x200B;

So why the public relaunch?

Launching a coin can be a tough job. The team has chosen to do a re-launch of Hyperrail after the previous project stumbled upon a few bumps in the road. The smart was renounced and many holders stumbled upon the heavy slippage of 21% being a burden for further growth. Above that the market sentiment went down and the public listing of Coingecko and Coinmarketcap faced issues too. 

&#x200B;

Due to the strong team and community behind this token we‚Äôve managed to do a successful re-launch of Hyperrail with new tokenomics! The previous holders are compensated (about 1.5% of total supply) 48 hours after the public launch.

&#x200B;

This time both the team and community have great faith in the successful development of Hyperrail! The NFT Gaming space offers a lot of space for further growth and we look forward to show you the VR game that is currently being made.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,SafeBitcoin is a token on the Ethereum chain - Currently with a 1.3M market cap - Lots of potential - Huge things coming up,"Cryptocurrencies have taken the world and its financial ecosystem by storm. Call it the revolution of the 21st century if you wish; that is exactly what it is. This new technology, generated by Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs idea, has many facets such as smart contracts, blockchains, peer-to-peer, mining, trading, and more. It has become the game-changer in the world of financial transactions.

**SafeBitcoin overview:**  
 The air is already saturated with excitement and its community is growing fast. We welcome you to the world of SafeBTC, a combination of profitable yield-generating DeFi and safe store-of-value Bitcoin. There is no doubt that both ‚Äúworlds‚Äù have offered disrupting possibilities. Their impact cannot be emphasized well enough as they have given the cryptocurrency ecosystem a reason to live and thrive and as of today, surpass the 2T market cap globally. It is a pleasure to introduce this life-changing-opportunity token. The aim is to be at the forefront of wealth generation and a better and fairer economic standard of living. SafeBTC is a deflationary token allowing passive income generation. The first juicy feature is a ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù applied to transactions. This penalty increases the liquidity, reduces the supply and rewards token holders. Here‚Äôs how it works; 4% on each transaction is split instantly among token holders and the liquidity pool, reducing supply. This arrangement eradicates the worries of gas fee friction when farming tokens. SafeBTC community is all about rewards and wealth creation. The system has a distribution on every transaction completed, with 2% locked in liquidity and burned forever and another 2% is redistributed to token holders as reward.

**- Now proudly on both BSC & ETH -**

After amassing over 200,000 holders on BSC, we are launched on ETH.

We wanted to disrupt the status quo and set ourselves apart from ordinary DeFi tokens that pop out everyday.

We are frictionless, yield generating, safe & audited. Earn interests by holding #SafeBTC on both BSC & ETH.

First step: launch of the M7 Vault Token (M7 VAULT), the governance token for the M7 Capital Investment Platform

üí≥M7 CAPITAL INVESTMENT PLATFORMüí≥

This platform will be a one-stop-shop for investors looking for safe and effective Dividend Yield Tokens, which we are dubbing Capital Asset Tokens or CATs, and what we believe will be revolutionary in the DeFi Vault space: our Capital Investment Vaults or CIVs.

These vaults will allow investors to stake our Capital Asset Tokens and compound their holdings, not by cannibalizing the Capital Asset Tokens themselves, but by using the dividends they generate to buy back and increase holdings. By pooling together funds from multiple investors, it will multiply the buying power and create a positive feedback loop of value.

M7 VAULT TOKEN (VAULT)

The first step, and a cornerstone one, is to officially launch the M7 Vault Token on 30th August, the governance token.

This is to us the main driver that will build the whole ecosystem of the M7 Capital Investment Platform.

The team is dedicated and experienced in creating high-yield tokens. The team has been involved in many fair launches in the past. Several of their token (GhostPumpers, Moonwalker, Saturday Night Elon...) did 1000x.

With their innovative approach, they were pioneers in the creation of dividend-yield token, thanks to Doge Back, the first token with dividend-yield paid in Dogecoin.

The team has consistently proven in every one of their projects that they are never out to scam, defraud or purposefully do harm to the community. Any time there were issues they were addressed with transparency (at times to a fault) and integrity.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,$CONE - Best memecoin on reddit! Why buy Bitcoin when you can buy Bitcone?,"
What is BitCone ($CONE)?

BitCone (CONE) is a Decentralized Community Utility Token made by Cones, for Cones. 608 Billion tokens were created on the Polygon Network (with no mint function) to parallel the 608 Cone Head - Reddit Collectible Avatar NFT, that inspired a meme Conemunity. 

BitCone is governed democratically, so every decision is voted on via Conemunity Polls. 

BitCones can be earned through Airdrops and ""BitCone Mining"", a revolutionary automated content monetization platform, that incentivizes user engagement on partnered Subreddits.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

What can Bitcone be used for?

- Post 2 Earn - BitCone Mining, rewarding engagement with CONE Tokens
- Tipping on Reddit.com/r/ConeHeads and other Subreddits
- Trading Reddit NFT Avatars on the AvatarMate.xyz Avatar Marketplace
- Earning Liquidity Rewards
- Minting NFT with CONE Tokens
- Bidding on Auctions with CONE Tokens


How many CONE tokens are there in circulation?

CONE was deployed on the Polygon Network on September 20th 2022, with 608 billion CONE tokens, created to parallel the 608 Cone Head - Reddit Collectible Avatar NFT that inspired it. 

There is no mint function in the CONE Smart Contract, so there can never be more than 608 billion BitCone.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,WorkQuest offers the benefits of getting paid for work in the $WUSD stablecoin,"Users wield the WUSD a **crypto-backed stablecoin**, native to the WorkQuest platform when creating **a smart contract** between an employer and worker. $WUSD will be issued in three pools of **$WQT, $BNB, $ETH**. The users of the WorkQuest platform can use it to exchange for another cryptocurrency or withdraw to a bank card on the WorkQuest platform.

WUSD primarily targets **employers and employees**, offering them an instrument to **guarantee the cost of work** performed to **avoid volatility** **and loss in fund value** when performing work on the WorkQuest platform. Moreover, getting paid in WUSD is **simpler** and **more beneficial** than any other cryptocurrency (let‚Äôs say, for example, Bitcoin) because a person need not rely on a significant market price change before getting paid.

WorkQuest ecosystem includes two tokens: $WQT Governance Token and $WUSD stablecoin. The $WQT token performs a management function. It is used to vote for key aspects for the functioning and survival of the project in terms of risk management, as well as the business logic. The $WQT utilities include:

üîπWorkQuest DAO management¬†  
üîπWorkQuest Referral Program¬†

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,BabyBitcoin BITC in huge Media Deal with Europes biggest race team with British Touring Cars. | Massive Global TV Coverage!,"Baby Bitcoin -  The UK crypto coin gained over 300% yesterday with the news of this monumental sponsorship deal between them and British Touring Cars championship team, TEAM HARD.

Team hard are now Europe's Biggest racing team and have the UK's biggest in house media centre. The sponsorship deal has stirred up such a storm in the UK they are going all out in promoting Baby Bitcoin in the press and papers.

The first race will be 31st of July and televised globally. baby Bitcoin is the sponsor of one of the team hard cars, the same team Lewis Hamiltons brother will be driving for, so exposure will be HUGE.

Baby Bitcoin is the project backed by populus 4 team who are 4 fully doxxed UK devs with a point to prove. They want to create a safe space for investors to invest while making gains of 1000% and up, this is not possible with Bitcoin but completely possible with baby Bitcoin.

Their mission to show the world that crypto is a safe and honest place has been constantly bombarded with lies, scams, cheats and dirty tactics from other coins, they still stand strong with a huge community behind them and over 5000 holders.

The have been listed with Coin Market Cap and Coin Gecko and exchanges are already in their sights. the hype is HUGE

There is a huge press release on Monday from Team Hard and BTCC regarding this. Now is a great time to get in before this is released.

**This is the first time EVER in the UK and Europe a deal of this magnitude and expense has been done.**

The team have secured not only this next race but the whole season. That's 7 races, shown globally to over 100 million viewers.

**The first race is on 31st July at Oulton Park UK. This will be LIVE on TV and satellite.**

There is also a great clothing label they are behind. If they put as much effort into that as they did with BTCC it will be as big. bringing the Baby Bitcoin name to the public. the clothing initially will be sold on their website but the team are pushing for high street stores in the UK then to push it out globally.

Be wary of other coins there is only one babyBitcoin BITC its the one with the pink logo. you cant miss it.

Usual Tokenomics rewards the Loyal holder 

There are no dev wallets and all the team bought the maximum 2 BNB in presale as every other investor.

The media coverage on this will be HUGE its going down in history.

Team are fully doxxed and will be doing an AMA with BTCC and team hard before the race so you can imagine this will be HUGE.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Green Bitcoin - $GBTC - What you should know before you buy,"Green Bitcoin is an ERC-20 token that became available for trade on uniswap on April 5th. Six days later, on the 11th of April, it was listed on a top 15 exchange (MEXC). Leading up to that exchange listing the ATH was $2. The project has since experienced the typical shake out, resulting in a normal and acceptable correction to the chart bringing the price back down to between $0.75 and $1.10.

Then, the entire market took an unexpected hit after the attacks on Israel had everyone panicked. This resulted in a further drop in the chart. Then, BTC decided to continue to dump in preparation for the BTC halving. This has impacted the price to the point that it is severely oversold in its current state. The price of Green Bitcoin currently sits around $0.45.

Despite all the negatives I just laid out, Green Bitcoin has continued to gain new holders day by day. Currently sitting around 6800 holders, up from the 4k+ at launch. 24-hour trading volume has remained healthy in the 6 figures. The market cap has remained in the millions. The community has continued to grow with over 6k members on telegram and 26k+ followers on X.

Now, the reason I can confidentiality say this token is oversold right now and extremely undervalued is because of what they have coming all within their first month of trading.

1. They already have a scheduled announcement on the 25th of April for another CEX listing. They originally would only say it was a Teir 1 exchange, but after a little prodding, we were informed that ""Anything below top 15, doesn't provide value."" That statement paired with the knowledge that MEXC is #13 on Coingecko suggests that we are likely looking at a top 10 exchange listing.

2. On the 18th of April, the Devs will be unveiling a sneak peek into their revolutionary gamified staking. Holders will have the ability to earn big rewards by attempting to predict BTC trends. Their site also suggests that more gaming and earning opportunities will be added as the project continues to develop.

3. Th Devs have strategically planned the announcements, listings, and previews, all around the most anticipated crypto event that takes place roughly every 4 years. The Bitcoin halving! The Green Bitcoin Developers know that, historically, this event marks the beginning of the next crypto Bull Cycle/Run.

None of this is financial advice, but as for me, I like the token. I see huge potential in this project both short term and long term.

If you are interested in checking it out for yourself, I will provide some links below. And by all means, please feel free to comment and upvote if you decide you like the project as much as I do!

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Hawk Tuah Girls Biggest Memecoin Holding is $NEIREI and Why This Matters,"Haliey Welch, also known as Hawk Tuah girl, recently [doxxed](https://x.com/bubblemaps/status/1854609546695843841) her wallets, including her **Ethereum wallet** that can be found [here](https://debank.com/profile/0x713330395614441DceF0FeD76887B5f01f52f5d8).

Her top holdings consist of **$NEIREI at number one**, followed by $BRETT at number two and a few other random memecoins.

NeiRei, the Chinese version of $NEIRO, recently hit an all-time high of **$7 million in market cap** and has since consolidated nicely at **around $2.2 million**. With Neiro breaking past a **$1 billion market cap**, it‚Äôs only logical to expect that NeiRei, the top derivative of Neiro, is ready for a breakout.

To put it in perspective, $PEIPEI, the Chinese derivative of $PEPE, reached an ATH of **$170 million, approximately 4% of Pepe's ATH market cap**. By comparison, NeiRei is currently sitting at just **0.2% of Neiro‚Äôs market cap**. This leaves massive potential for growth. If NeiRei were to hit just **4% of Neiro‚Äôs market cap**, it would mean a 20x pump. Even reaching 1% would give a 5x, and that's highly likely at this point, especially as Bitcoin continues to break **ATH after ATH**.

Neiro's run to $1+ billion was largely driven by a **Binance spot listing**. However, Hawk Tuah's [tweet](https://x.com/HalieyWelchX/status/1846264142065176661) after Neiro made a donation to her charity, Paws Across America, also played a role. NeiRei‚Äôs community is following Neiro's path with plans to **support her charity as well**. With NeiRei being Hawk Tuah‚Äôs largest memecoin holding, I wouldn't be surprised if she shows her support for NeiRei as well! A NeiRei rally is primed at this point!

Furthermore, the **$MUMU content team** is currently working on a **high-quality animated short** featuring NeiRei and Hawk Tuah at a Mets game. That should be released within the next few days!

# Whale Activity

There has been numerous [millionaires](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1fjaup3/millionaires_started_swapping_neiro_into_neirei/) that continue to accumulate NeiRei. It's as if they know what's coming. ;)

# Burns

We have prepared the site, the telegram group and we will not fail with continuous updates on the site and in the group.  But we want to remind you that we will be investors just like you.  So the help of anyone who has the opportunity is welcome.  Sharing is the best marketing weapon.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Community Takeover $Poowel Looks Primed For New Highs,"~Our New Tweet: https://twitter.com/poowel_solana/status/1776718775003332614

Sitting within the strongly trending PoliFi category of Solana memecoins Joram $Poowel (after FED chair Jerome Powell) is a solid pick to capitalise on the ongoing Solana memecoin mania. 

Surrounded by rugs & scams launched by predatory devs, $Poowel stands out as a genuine community takeover that has impressively built from $50k market cap valuation up to $4m (hitting a peak of $6m so far). 

All the talk for this cycle is of a 'Barbell Portolio' where smart money focuses on Bitcoin and the ETF narrative and retail mostly flocks to Solana for cheap transactions and memecoins that 1000x within weeks. 

As with previous cycles we should expect the trend to be our friend and for the 'Barbell Portfolio' to continue to outperform... with attention from the presidential election campaign leading other PoliFi tokens to $500m+ valuations I think we can safely say a solid project like $Poowel, with a transparent & highly active community team, to outperform in this sector and within Solana memes in general. 

Money printing is the largest meme within this space, and the very reason for the existence of Bitcoin & crypto in the first place. 

Joram Poowel has built rock solid foundations and looks set to tap into this ongoing narrative of money printing and the devaluation of fiat currency by irresponsible centralised powers. 

The real Powell is sure to keep the money printer running, continue adding to the gargantuan national debt and further devaluing the dollar. 

The $Poowel token is currently valued at $0.004. How long until the money printer brrrrrs so hard that $Poowel ends up pegged to the dollar?

1 $POOWEL = 1 $USD 

How long until it catches up with the worlds biggest shitcoin? In a world where $Boden ripped 1000x in just 1 month this is entirely possible.

We have accomplished so much and I'm super proud of this family and community for being active and willing to help the team row in the same direction at the same time.  This is how we all win!  I know some of you may be growing impatient as we have been trending sideways.  Remember, whenever you are feeling this way, put the chart to the hourly chart and ZOOM OUT.

We have been maintaining \~ 2.4 mil MC which is roughly about 5x from the IDO listing price!  Most projects would have had a massive correction back towards the initial presale price, but our holders are standing their ground, staking their pets, and earning massive $PETS rewards! üëè

Remind yourself that this is a SERIOUS project with AMAZING potential!  Projects like this take some time to really develop and take off.  Those who are early (all of you here now) will be rewarded if you're smart and HODL with those diamond hands! üíéü§≤

**Note:**

Bitcoin has surpassed its ALL TIME HIGH of $64,976 and is in price discovery now!  The bull run is about to hit it's final leg up and BTC is going to run HARD, then the alts will follow suit.  This is going to be a FUN couple of months before the BTC halving at the end of the year.  REMEMBER, do NOT get FOMO and ape into these massive pumps you'll be seeing in the big market, be patient, increase your buying power, and wait for the bear market to accumulate!

üëá Now, let's get into what we are looking forward to this week! üëá

¬ª Just an hour ago or so we got a pinned post in Travladd's Serious Investor Group!  Travladd runs an awesome AMA & gem hunting group and there are some deep pockets in there!

¬ª Next week on Oct. 26th at 7pm UTC we will be having an AMA in Travladd's group as well!  Let's make sure we all show our support by showing up to that, mark your calendars!

¬ª PooCoin Ads campaign resumes and continue to draw new curious BSC investors to $PETS

¬ª We have hired a top notch copywriter to draft articles for the following platforms:

   üëâ  Yahoo Finance, Yahoo News, AP News, Morningstar, MarketWatch, Benzinga, & Street Insider

¬ª Several high-quality YouTube project reviewers are producing videos for us to showcase the aesthetic MicroPETS DApp & all the adorable artwork & media we have to share with the world!  You should start seeing some of these starting potentially today or tomorrow!  Remember when these come out it's super important we share them everywhere and blow up social media!

¬ª Today we are going live with the ""Micro Meme Wednesday"" meme competition giveaway!  Keep an eye out for Malek's pinned posts for details on how you can win some more FREE BNB!  More memes, more memes!  Get creative!

Hope you're looking forward to some even more #BULLISH news for $PETS moving forward!

There are several things I am not sanctioned to announce to the community yet, but just wait üòâ

Oh... did I forget something?...

Did somebody say.....

**üò± SPECIAL EDITION CRATES? üò±**

( Keep an üëÄ out )

Not only that, we will be increasing the staking rewards significantly today! ü§ëü§ë

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Defi Bitcoin | Innovative DeFi Project that Rewards Users for their Trading Behaviour,"**DeFi Bitcoin** is an innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) project built on the Ethereum blockchain. It incorporates a distinctive market cycle framework, aiming to provide controlled trading behavior, mitigate price volatility, and incentivize users through **reward mechanisms.**

Defi Bitcoin operates on a weekly market cycle, consisting of **two phases**:

* **Bull Market (4 days):** A period of upward price movement, fostering market growth. In this phase holders who do not sell 15% or more of their holdings are entitled to rewards. Also, a 10% bonus is awarded if a user buys 10% or more of their current position size during the bull market.

* **Bear Market (3 days):** A phase characterized by downward price movement, allowing for corrections and adjustments. In this phase holders who do not sell 25% or more of their holdings qualify for rewards. A 30% bonus is granted if a user buys 10% or more of their position size during the bear market.

The eligibility for these rewards can be checked through their unique and accessible **Telegram Bot DeFi Bitcoin Bot.**
 
A halving event occurs between these markets, reducing the remaining supply by half. The initial supply starts at 15,750,000 and can reach a maximum of 21,000,000.

**Tax Structure:** 
The tax structure is adaptive, promoting a balanced trading environment: In a bull market, tax stands at 0/8, while in a bear market, it's set at 3/3. After three market cycles, the tax permanently drops to 0/0, ensuring reduced friction for long-term participants.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Beyond Protocol -- Bigger than BTC," Over the past month or so, analysts have consistently called [Beyond Protocol](http://beyond.link/) the next top three coin. Examples include [Crypto Rick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U4Dk-rGRkc), [Satoshi Sean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH1N6KWSShA), and [KIFS Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLHgVep3tcI). Although a lot to consider, I generally agreed. This is a team from Stanford, IBM, Cisco, Amazon buoyed by Hollywood execs (it shows in their insane marketing; check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1txFf7Cv8K8) overview video). They are solving a big problem: devices in the future will need to pay each other digitally. The Gartners of the world have said there will be more transactions between devices than humans. 

Then I watched an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCt0R3N9uC4) with the CEO Jonathan Manzi and Tijo Bear. It‚Äôs long --  38 minutes. While I was watching it, it dawned on me that Beyond Protocol will be bigger than Bitcoin. 

Devices don‚Äôt need just to be able to pay each other, they need to be made secure so they can open up to the world. The world can then develop on top of them. Beyond Protocol has built a frictionless technology which can be adopted with one line of code which makes spoofing -- the biggest pain point in cybersecurity right now -- probabilistically impossible. They do this by leveraging hardware signatures and distributed ledgers. Manzi explains it in less than 45s in [this](https://twitter.com/FlameCryptos/status/1404846333861765122) video tweet (watch it, everything will click!)

What Beyond Protocol has built does two critical things. 

First, it makes devices secure for the first time. Now secure, they can open up. And now developers can build applications on top which unite them. Just from a smartphone, Apple‚Äôs App Store brought us applications which changed the way we live: Uber, Instacart, etc. Beyond Protocol‚Äôs Mega App Store will allow developers to build apps on not just an iPhone, but literally every device in the universe. 

Second, it allows devices to pay each other. And the ‚Äúpay each other‚Äù part can get really nuts quickly. It can be autonomous vehicles paying each other for priority in a traffic grid. Or, it can be simply microtransactions which represent the amount of energy expended for a secure message to be sent between devices. Beyond Protocol is literally building the new Internet for devices. They are doing what the biggest companies in the world have tried to do in business consortia over the past decade but failed due to the battle of egos that always goes on -- one company trying to gain dominance over others. Beyond Protocol is opening a can of whoop-ass on all that. They‚Äôre going all open-source protocol, just like ARPA when the internet was started, and they will win. Don‚Äôt bet against an idea which time has come. 

I am a proud member of their Street Team by the way. I will do my best to answer any questions you might have. Some resources below (posted from their Telegram):

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Bitcoin Pizza Day | Just Launched! | Celebrating a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency history!,"Savouring the Revolutionary Spirit of Bitcoin Pizza Day with a Deliciously Inspired Token

&#x200B;

Welcome, crypto enthusiasts, to the tantalising world of Bitcoin Pizza Day! **On May 22nd, we celebrate a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency history when the first-ever real-world transaction took place using Bitcoin**In honor of this groundbreaking event, I present to you **an exciting new crypto token that captures the essence of Bitcoin Pizza Day**Get ready to sink your teeth into the delectable blend of innovation and nostalgia with their mouthwatering token!

&#x200B;

A Slice of Crypto History:

&#x200B;

Let‚Äôs rewind the clock back to 2010 when a certain programmer, Laszlo Hanyecz, famously purchased two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoins. Little did he know that this seemingly simple act would cement its place in the annals of cryptocurrency lore. Today, the devs of Bitcoin Pizza Day pay homage to Hanyecz‚Äôs culinary adventure and the immense value those pizzas eventually held. Their token, inspired by this historic transaction, carries the torch forward, symbolizing the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies.

&#x200B;

Savoury Ingredients of the Token:

&#x200B;

Just like the perfect pizza, their token is crafted with care and precision, ensuring a delicious experience for holders. Here are the key ingredients that make their token truly unique:

&#x200B;

a. **Tasty Tokenomics**: Bitcoin Pizza Day comes with a low buy and sell tax, rewarding long-term holders with constant marketing and exposure. Each transaction contributes to the overall scarcity of the token due to the ever expanding exposure, making it a savoury investment opportunity for all crypto enthusiasts.

&#x200B;

b. **Community Slice**: Building a strong community is the heart and soul of their project. They encourage active participation, hosting regular events, AMAs (Ask Me Anything), and contests that create a welcoming space for their token holders to connect and engage with like-minded individuals.

&#x200B;

c. **Wholesome Partnerships**: To enhance the flavor of their token, the devs have established strategic partnerships with other tokens as well as well known influencers. Through these collaborations, they aim to create real-world use cases for their token, allowing you to feast on more than just digital delights.

&#x200B;

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,"Bitcoin Accumulator | Just Launched | First DeFi 2.1 | Current APR 7,000% | Retro Pixel Art Game Style to make earning FUN | First launch from Player 2 Metaverse | CMC and CG soon","**‚ùì What is the Bitcoin Accumulator? ‚ùì**  
The Bitcoin Accumulator is the world‚Äôs first **DeFi 2.1** product. Set in the Financial Brewery of Player 2‚Äôs ever-expanding metaverse on the Solana network, interact with our Player 2 characters to accumulate more Bitcoin, purchase bonds and more!

The Bitcoin Accumulator features three main types of tokens:

(1) The asset we are trying to accumulate: Bitcoin (BTC)

(2) A wrapped and backed version of that asset: wrapped Bitcoin (wrBTC)

(3) And our accumulator token: BTCA

The key mechanisms of the Bitcoin Accumulator are:

(A) **Profiting from the underlying asset‚Äôs volatility:**

The protocol is designed to capture market inefficiencies between BTC & wrBTC, turning market volatility into a source of value.

(B) **Dynamic Profit Distribution mechanism**

The protocol only mints new tokens when it makes a profit. The profits are distributed in real-time and the profits are represented by the Accumulator Index.

(C) **Adding a delay to reduce selling pressure**

To mint our BTCA token, users can instantaneously upgrade their wrBTC. However, if they wish to get their wrBTC back, there will be a downgrade delay. This means in order to purchase attractive bonds immediately, users will need to use fresh funds for the purchase.

(D) **A strong, ever-increasing backing value**

Unlike DeFi 2.0 projects, our treasury will not keep our own tokens (wrBTC and BTCA). The treasury will only hold BTC as the sole asset. Additionally, since new token emissions are based on profitability, emissions will never cause the backing to decrease.

**‚ùì What is DeFi 2.1?‚ùì**

DeFi 2.1 is an improved protocol based on DeFi 2.0. It seeks to solve a couple of fundamental issues such as constant selling pressure and unreliable backing value.

While it does not feature the spectacularly high yields that some DeFi 2.0 projects offer, it promises that its backing value will only ever increase.

**Why Join Us?**

üíé Be a part of a new revolutionary wave of DeFi

üíé Community funded, absolutely **NO VC money**

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Why Bitcoin (COIN: $BTC) Fell Below $70K on Monday As Halving Nears,"Bitcoin (COIN: [$BTC](https://dexwirenews.com/why-bitcoin-coin-btc-fell-below-dollar70k-on-monday-as-halving-nears/)) has had a great run since the start of 2024, crossing the $70K mark at one point in mid-March. Towards the end of the month on Thursday, March 28, 2024, the price held steady for a while above the $70K mark. However, on Monday, April 1, 2024, the price of BTC fell below the $70K mark.  
  
[Bitcoin Falls Below $70K](https://dexwirenews.com/why-bitcoin-coin-btc-fell-below-dollar70k-on-monday-as-halving-nears/)  
Bitcoin was trading at around $69,745 per coin as of 8:30 AM in New York, losing around 1.03% of its value in the past 24 hours.  
  
Despite the 1% drop, the price of Bitcoin has remained relatively stable in the past week as the halving nears. Its price is hovering around $70K after some slight movement to over $71K.  
  
At the start of last week, the price rose above $71K briefly after BlackRock‚Äôs Head of Digital Assets Robert Mtichnick said that Bitcoin was a good way to diversify your portfolio.    
  
Another driver of the [BTC price](https://dexwirenews.com/why-bitcoin-coin-btc-fell-below-dollar70k-on-monday-as-halving-nears/) surge last week was the net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. At the start of the week, there was $15 million in net positive inflows, with the trend continuing on Tuesday and Wednesday with inflows of $418 million and $243 million, respectively. Since the SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs in January, there have been $12.1 billion in recorded inflows.  
  
Over the Easter Holiday, the price of BTC held steady at around $70K. However, it dipped below $70K as volatility picked up days to the halving.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,"Bitcoin Soars Past $35,000. Here is an altcoin set for 300% gains","The world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has surged over the $35,000 resistance level, defying market expectations for a correction. While the price chart might show some volatility, the robust buying momentum sets the stage for Bitcoin to maintain its current position and possibly reach new heights.   
  
Bitcoin, Bitcoin Soars Past $35,000. Here is an altcoin set for 300% gains   
What‚Äôs even more exciting is that global asset management firm, Alliance Bernstein anticipates Bitcoin‚Äôs price could reach $150,000 by the year 2025. In addition to this firm‚Äôs analysts, several others strongly agree that the recent price surge is closely tied to the anticipation of approvals for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).   
  
Furthermore, an analyst on Twitter (X) platform has also made a prediction, suggesting that the price of Bitcoin could potentially range between $90,000 to $130,000 by November 28, 2025.  
  
But that‚Äôs not all‚Äîthere‚Äôs a whole world of altcoins out there, some already on the rise, and others poised for gains in the weeks ahead. One such top altcoin is Vulcan Forged (PYR) which has taken center stage, boasting an impressive gain of over 27% at the time of writing.   
  
Is PYR set to enter the top 100?  
Amidst Bitcoin‚Äôs spectacular rally, there‚Äôs another player gaining significant attention in the Web3 gaming space ‚Äì Vulcan Forged (PYR).    
  
As Vulcan Forged PYR has been making waves with a series of impressive performances, its current price at $5.52 and a 24-hour price rise of 27% have garnered significant interest from the crypto community. Despite potential price chart volatility, Vulcan Forged PYR‚Äôs strong buying momentum is undeniable.  
  
Moreover, the PYR token is already listed on top crypto exchanges, including Binance, KuCoin, and others. Its recent listing on South Korea‚Äôs prominent exchange, Bithumb, has further positioned and expanded its reach into the Asian market.  
  
Bitcoin, Bitcoin Soars Past $35,000. Here is an altcoin set for 300% gains   
But PYR is not the only reason to keep an eye on Vulcan Forged. The platform is the ultimate web3 ecosystem. It has been experiencing exponential organic growth over the last two years, attracting over 200,000 users across 15 games and dApps without external capital.   
  
With a portfolio of hit web3 gaming titles such as VulcanVerse, Forge Arena, and Berserk, Vulcan Forged is on the verge of revolutionizing the metaverse landscape. Their upcoming release, MetaScapes, introduces a patented metaverse-as-a-service engine that enables users to effortlessly create and manage their metaverse lands stored as NFTs. This groundbreaking technology empowers gamers to become virtual world creators without requiring coding skills.  
  
Vulcan Forged Metaverse, MetaScapes, aims to be a strong player in the growing world of metaverse gaming, promising an immersive experience like no other.   
  
Besides metaverse, Vulcan Forged is leading the way into the future with its first-ever Oculus VR NFT Game, Tartarus. This pioneering integration of NFTs and virtual reality is set to make Tartarus the FIRST-EVER Oculus VR NFT Game. With these groundbreaking innovations in gaming, metaverse, and NFTs, Vulcan Forged presents an exciting prospect for investors and enthusiasts alike.  
  
Analyst‚Äôs Bullish View on PYR   
As Vulcan Forged PYR has witnessed price increases in the past 24 hours, analysts are closely observing PYR‚Äôs movement, anticipating potential price movement in the near future. Rekt Capital, crypto trader and analyst, on Twitter (X) platform highlighted that PYR should be able to reach $6.72 while another analyst, Crypto Feras, has drawn attention to PYR‚Äôs potential breakout after 550 days of accumulation. According to his insight, the rule of thumb in cryptocurrency is that the longer the accumulation period, the stronger the breakout tends to be.   
  
In a bullish view, Karan Singh Arora, a crypto educator, also anticipates that PYR is now breaking out of a significant accumulation zone, potentially leading it to reach $9 in the near future. These views paint an optimistic outlook for PYR .   
  
Will Bitcoin continue its remarkable run, defying market expectations? Is Vulcan Forged PYR set to become the next game-changing altcoin? The answers to these questions lie in the dynamic and ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies.

Grouper Swap BTC/LTC/DOGE:GROUPER: [grouper.website/?page\_id=2201](https://grouper.website/?page_id=2201)

&#x200B;

Why is it named Grouper? Because there are three lotteries grouped into one!

&#x200B;

\--- What is it? ----

The Grouper Token is a perpetual lottery token hosted on the Binance Smart Chain. There are hourly, daily, and weekly Lottery draws. The amount of Grouper tokens needed to play will be determined by the cost of the coin and overall total holders.  All you must do is have at least the minimum amount to automatically be entered into all the lotteries. 176 Lotteries A Week

Current Min Tokens to Be Entered in Lotteries: 50,000 Grouper

BSC Contract Address: 0x9ce5222a0419cc4d25ece978aaa5d8c31b3565e6

&#x200B;

\--- How do I make money? ---

1. Buy the minimums to play lottery and enjoy community

2. Buy more, become an owner, help steer the project and eventually sell back your tokens to those trying to join at a much higher price + play all the lotteries.

&#x200B;

\--- Why is it different? ---

The supply of Grouper is elastic. You have deflationary pressure when Grouper is traded as there is a 6% tax on every transaction. 5% that is burned, along with the 1% advertising fee (6% total). This helps to reduce supply while also discouraging high speed bots from buying and selling around the lottery times. The Grouper contract is fully published for everyone to read unlike many other lottery tokens on the Binance Smart Chain.

&#x200B;

\--- How can they guarantee winners? --- (THIS SOLVES PROBLEM 1)

Minting coins is not evil, as long as it is explained upfront. To ensure timely lotteries the coins are minted. Hence if transaction volume is low this might cause slight inflation. The max coins awarded per week is equal to 1.5% of the total available coins. The 5% transfer tax easily counteracts this over time.

Many other bsc lotteries die because their volume trails off and they cannot pay lotteries!

\--- What the heck is GROUPER Swap? --- (SOLVES PROBLEM 2)

Grouper swap allows newer members to bsc to buy in directly with Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Doge coin. (More coins added soon). This allows them to skip pancake swap and all the headaches of converting to bnb and then to the GROUPER lottery token. Imagine when the Doge boys figure out they can join a lottery join FOR LIFE for 50 Doge.

&#x200B;

\--- Simplicity --- (SOLVES PROBLEM 3)

Buy, hold, and win. It is literally that simple. If your wallet holds the minimum amount you are eligible to play all 176 weekly GROUPER lotteries! The minimum amount needed will NEVER go up, only down as the market cap increases. The dev‚Äôs are aiming to peg it at a $25 entry per wallet. So, if you buy more coins make sure to split them into separate wallets so you get more chances to win. (Metamask works great for this). The devs are also working on the website so you will be notified by email, telegram, and TEXT MESSAGE if you win! The weekly lottery is obviously the largest draw, but it is super fun being able to watch all the hourly winners in the chat get excited!

&#x200B;

\--- Published Contract ---

Grouper contract is fully published and the devs answer any questions about it. Please support open source and only contribute to bsc projects that fully publish their contracts!

&#x200B;

\--- What are the tokenomics? ---

The supply of Grouper is elastic. You have deflationary pressure when Grouper is traded as there is a 6% tax on every transaction. 5% that is burned, along with the 1% advertising fee (6% total). This helps to reduce supply while also discouraging high speed bots from buying and selling around the lottery times. The Grouper contract is fully published for everyone to read unlike many other lottery tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. The overall 5% burn results in deflationary pressure. Fair rules, published contract, and fair randomization.

&#x200B;

\--- Can you increase your odds? ---

If I have more Grouper does it increase my chances? No, each wallet has the same chance to win. You can split your wallet into several smaller wallets for better chances as long as they hold the minimum.

&#x200B;

\--- Liquidity lock? Presale? ---

The Grouper presale was 5/30/21 and sold. Liquidity locked until 2022.

&#x200B;

\--- How do I trust GROUPER? ---

Functions allow you to interact directly with GROUPER on the blockchain!

Trust but verify, all GROUPER information can be verified directly on the black chain. Examples include last winner, when the next jackpot is, and how many current holders there are.

&#x200B;

\--- Is there a roadmap? ---

\- Upcoming Mobile App

\- Text Notifications If You Win

\- Expanded Website Integration

\- Influencer Affiliate Program

\- Ethereum 2 Upgrades

&#x200B;

\--- Are you still reading? ---

If you are still reading, I hope you enjoyed learning a little bit about the Grouper project. I got my bags and am waiting for takeoff. I believe the facts presented above clearly explain why Grouper will be here for the long run and outpace all the bsc and crypto lotteries.

Grouper is not trying to be the best bsc lottery‚Ä¶ They are trying to be the best CRYPTO lottery!",2352,2021-06-10 09:03:37,204

Its future applications are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of computing and economics most of its possible functions will go over a typical investor‚Äôs head. There‚Äôs also HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu‚Äôs free market outlook, which is deftly woven into its creation- its personal philosophy draws heavily from Robert Malthus, for instance.

The shills understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this coin, to realise that it is not just speculation - it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the brilliance in its brilliant programming method - the ‚ÄúBlockchain,‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Haber and Stornetta's Merkle trees. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as our lord and savior's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 

And yes, by the way, i DO have a HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It‚Äôs for the ladies‚Äô eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they‚Äôre within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid",20,2023-07-01 19:08:05,14
BTC,CryptoMoonShots,"D.O.G.E on Ethereum Hit $500m, D.O.G.E on Solana Hit $100m, D.O.G.E on BASE is at Just $500k. Another 10x+ Call Incoming!","I've **consistently made 10x+ calls** over the past few months with projects like Ikigai (200x), DFNDR (120x), PalmAI (100x), Nitefeeder (50x), Drip (20x), NeiRei (14x), and many more. My track record speaks for itself‚Äîjust check my [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1f951t3/missed_my_200x_on_ikigai_heres_another_chance/) or [Twitter](https://x.com/Cryptovechkin) history for the **receipts**.

Now that I have your attention, let‚Äôs talk about another **gem with MASSIVE** potential.

Whether or not you like Elon Musk or Donald Trump, the reality is that **D.O.G.E** (Department of Government Efficiency) **will stay relevant for at least the next four years**. Donald Trump has officially started [D.O.G.E](https://x.com/doge) and appointed **Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead it**.

This means that **D.O.G.E will be everywhere**‚ÄîTV, social media, public transit, billboards, you name it. Even if you aren‚Äôt a fan of Elon Musk, you can still profit from his influence.

D.O.G.E on **Ethereum** recently pumped to a **$500 million market cap** and shows no signs of slowing down. D.O.G.E on **Solana** hit a **$100 million market cap** and also looks strong.

But the real gem is on **BASE chain**. D.O.G.E on BASE is sitting at a tiny **$500,000 market cap**‚Äîjust **$0.0005 per coin**! If it reaches Solana‚Äôs D.O.G.E market cap, that would be a **200x from here**, and a **1000x** if it reaches **Ethereum‚Äôs D.O.G.E** market cap.

D.O.G.E doesn‚Äôt even need marketing‚ÄîElon Musk and the President of the United States will essentially market it for **free across social media**. You can‚Äôt beat that kind of exposure.

With **Bitcoin** recently hitting **$95,000 USD**, the bull market has officially started. Having been through multiple bull runs, I can tell you that every chain will get its time to shine. With Ethereum gas fees continuing to rise, people will look to chains with **lower gas fees** like **BASE**.

Plus, D.O.G.E on BASE has been trending in **the top 5** on [Dextools](https://www.dextools.io/app/en/token/dogeonbase?t=1731655165196) since its launch. As people migrate to BASE chain, they‚Äôll see the top trending coins and instantly recognize D.O.G.E. It's obvious what they would buy.

The key to maximizing profit is to get in **before the masses**. D.O.G.E has the **perfect narrative**, a cheap token price, a relentless community, and **virtually unlimited marketing** that would surely take this to the moon!

Hi guys! You are searching for a legit token! Then check dexIRA! dexIRA provides fully automated multi-currency dividend rewards, advanced buyback protocols and tokenomics that promote long term holding and wealth generation.

Here the telegram and Website:

üí¨ Telegram: [https://t.me/dexIRA](https://t.me/dexIRA)

üåê Website: [https://dexIRA.com/](https://dexira.com/)

Here some short information about it:

üíé An Individual Retirement Account designed specifically for Decentralized Exchanges.

üíé dexIRA is the first token with multi-currency rewards, advanced buyback protocols and

üíé Tokenomics that promote long term hodling and wealth generation.

üöÄ Rewards holders in BNB, BTC, ETH, LINK, DOT, DOGE, SAFEMOON, ADA, BUSD, SAFEMOON and MORE! üéä

The platform is based on the synergy of two concepts: DEX (decentralized exchanges) and IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts). Borrowing from the long-term investment idea behind a traditional IRA, dexIRA investors can grow their holdings commission-free similar to tax-free IRA contributions. This allows members to increase their stake in the reward pool over time without sacrificing initial capital.

After a one-year holding period, investors can sell their $DEX holdings tax-free and penalty-free. However, similar to the age restrictions on a traditional IRA, if holders choose to sell early, they're penalized.

Investors are protected even when $DEX tokens are sold and the price drops because they are rewarded with two thirds of all fees collected. Similarly, the dexIRA contract includes enhanced token buyback protocols to spur growth and anti-whale measures to prevent large one-off sell orders.

**Key features of dexIRA**

‚úÖ Get 20% rewards

‚úÖ Auto-claimed Multi-Currency Reflections

‚úÖ Automatic Liquidity Pool

‚úÖ Friendly Wale Buyback & Burn

‚úÖ No mint token

‚úÖ Anti Whale Dumps

‚úÖ Burned LP

‚úÖ No Tax on Buy Orders

‚úÖ No rebase token

‚úÖ Sell tax removed after 1yr hodling

‚úÖ Funds Are Safu

**Whats so special? And why is it mooning?**

The strategy is simple: Incentivize new investment by waiving fees when purchasing dexIRA tokens. Support long-term growth by providing rewards and penalizing speculative short-term traders.

dexIRA was created to shift the mindset of investors and prove that cryptocurrencies can be stable, value-appreciating assets if the tokenomics support a long-term investment goal

Buy $DEX tokens without fees, use them to automatically collect and manage a diverse array of curated tokens in the following cryptocurrencies: BNB, BUSD, BTCB, ETH, DOGE, CAKE, XRP, LITE, LINK, DOT, ADA. SAFEMOON, ATOM, MATIC, TETHER, 1INCH, BUNNY.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,X . com - There is currently one narrative that truly stands out and it is that of X . com - Connections to OG bitcoin whales as well as huge revenue sharing incoming for holders.,"This is not a post about Twitter's makeover to X, it is about something way more interesting that has deep roots to the early cyberpunk days of Bitcoin, back when Bitcoin had almost no monetary value, when people bought pizza with 10,000 BTC.

  
**There are two x.com:**  
One is owned by Elon.  
The other, by the team behind X.com one of the most prominent upcoming projects on the Ethereum chain.

  
The domain was originally owned by Herbert Lim, OG Bitcoin Whale:  
https://twitter.com/HerbertRSim/status/1686609192239742976

  
Herbert sold the domain to the developers of X.com. The original domain was used in the Cypherpunk‚Äôs Manifesto, where the early teachings of Bitcoin began.

  
**NARRATIVE**

  
All in all the backing X.com is getting is not just ETH whales who are the usual suspects, the reach of X.com stretches further back, early Bitcoin adopters including Herbert are fully endorsing the movement. These are people with wide connections to the space, from Vitalik to CZ and Ceo's of almost any other reputable exchange and Defi protocol.  
This is also the reason why X.com has already gained so much traction this early in its journey.

  
A narrative like the one on X.com should not be ignored. Early Bitcoin whales are showing clear connections to the project.

  
**REVENUE SHARING**

  
Furthermore, the team recently explained how they will be redistributing revenue from the sale of the website to all holders.  
""Upon sale of the domain, 66.6% of the revenue from the sale will be shared with our stakeholders. 10% will be used for buy backs. And the remaining % will be distributed to the team.  
Recorded on the blockchain as per proof. ""  
\-CP33

  
This can potentially become one of the largest revenue sharing events in all of crypto/investing. Moreover, Elon bought his X domain for 91million $ so this will be on his radar.

  
**TLDR**  
\-There are two X.com Elon's one and the one of this ERC20 project.  
\-Several OG Bitcoin whales are backing X.com  
\-Revenue sharing will be the biggest event to come  
\-Elon musk will inevitably have this on his radar considering he spent $91 mil on his domain.

MANUAL BURNS 

Token burn is also a good method to aid token development . We plan on having quarterly burn having burnt 25% of the total supply already on the day the token was created . For more transparency the manual burn and the amounts can be advertised and tracked.

MINI BTC aims to implement a burn strategy that is beneficial and rewarding for those engaged for the long term. Furthermore, the total number of MINI BTC token burned is featured on our readout located on the website which allows for further transparency in identifying the current circulating supply at any given point of time.

Ownership Renounced.","Alright guys, I know we are experiencing a lot of FUD and red in the market today. Some people say it‚Äôs he Turkish Bitcoin thief, some say it‚Äôs the new American Tax Plan causing panic selling, others say maybe it‚Äôs a Bitcoin correction. To be honest I can‚Äôt be too sure, but in a sea of red, my one coin in this poop space that is consolidating and looking for a breakout, is Moon Pirate. 

It‚Äôs bounced several times and it looks like what is a bull flag (not financial advice). Been buying on these dips and hoping to the pirate gods this goes skyrocketing like Bonfire. The market cap only ever hit $60m at its peak and is sitting around $20m right now. Gives me a feeling we could see some heavy price action and easy gains from here. 

Best part is the marketing/dev (he‚Äôs not owner since he‚Äôs renounced) has been up to date, and they‚Äôve clarified that they will be launching their own brand of Rum. The rum actually has a partnership with a distillery now in California, and it‚Äôs information is all in the litepaper on their website. 

Honestly I‚Äôm pretty bullish on this. I haven‚Äôt seen many physical products especially in this meme coin space, but we can actually own something physical once these launch. They said they‚Äôll be doing maybe 100 1st edition bottles that can be shipped in the US for first takers, and they‚Äôll be linking it to NFTs (bottle comes with NFT ownership).

*There's only 3 matches before the main event so it's likely to draw a lot of eyes. This will be huge as it will bring in a ton of new retail investors that love MMA and most likely energy drinks!*

**- MoonJuice Has Officially Partnered With 100xCoin!**

100xCoin is another Binance Smart Chain project founded by Ken The Crypto. They've just revealed that they're going to be a Launchpad as well as they're building their own Mobile App - Altbase - ""that allows alt-coin purchases on BSC from debit and credit cards.""

*How will this partnership benefit MoonJuice? My guess is that users will be able to purchase $MOJO tokens from the $100x app Altbase, which will further increase the reach that MoonJuice has to acquire more holders. Basically, this means number go up!*

**- MoonJuice Has Officially Partnered With SaveTheWorld!**

SaveTheWorld is a project that aims to be the defining charity token on the Binance Smart Chain by helping the World through its donations. The partnership was officially announced live on the $SAVE livestream where they also completed another donation on stream.

*To me this partnership could mean possible collaborative energy drink cans in the future where a percentage of the proceeds would go to charity. This would be awesome because it would tie MoonJuice to a charitable cause, attracting more people to want to join the $MOJO community!*

**- MoonJuice Coming To The Miami Bitcoin Conference!**

The Miami Bitcoin Conference is just around the corner, and MoonJuice team will all be there to spread those $MOJO vibes! The Bitcoin 2021 Conference is happening on June 4-5, and the team will be coming with a surprise - the second iteration of their drinks! 

*The team clearly has a ton of unique ideas on ways to implement blockchain tech right into the hands of mainstream adoption, and they are going full force*

Currently trending as a ""Top Gainer"" on CoinMarketCap, MoonJuice was just recently listed on both CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which skyrocketed the growth of their community! They also just doxxed their third developer BSC Chad, who turns out to be Patrick Sutton! He is officially the CEO of MoonJuice and he for sure looks like a chad! Here's a medium post revealing the chad himself: moonjuiceenergy.medium.com/oh-hello-patrick-261108d26202

WarMus Land Presents SCARDust ($SCARD), a cutting edge crypto, gaming, and animation project with a clear vision, purpose, substance, and anticipation.

Before diving into the core dev team and the metaverse (or multiverse) they‚Äôre building, I would like to touch upon the global macroeconomic backdrop in crypto: where we've been, where we are, and where we're going. While we've seen nation-states and corporations alike adopt Bitcoin, we‚Äôve too witnessed the explosion of exchanges (DEXs and CEXs) and other layer one protocols like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Protocols that usher in anticipated and highly sought-after 6, 7, and even 8 figure NFTs like Beeple, and relevant brands like Bored Ape Yacht Club. This comes as no surprise, us digitizing our art. We‚Äôve digitized our information, communication, and now comes money and art (and everything else on a blockchain!). Money, yes! Art, yes! Gaming, sh*t yeah! Mash them all together and I present to you:

The team behind WarMus Land, a web3 company, is creating a comic multiverse with a p2e fighting tournament style game (think Street Fighter), with in-game limited edition digital collectibles and NFT trading cards, wearables, weapons, and land parcels ‚Äì all taking place within a virtual world, in time once the project sees the finish line.

It‚Äôs still very early in the SCARDust token journey and the virtual world is a ways away, but (1) the easy-to-play p2e game on smartphones and tablets (duck, jump, back, fwd, kick punch!), plus (2) a binge worthy Hollywood-produced animated comic series is pushing the envelope. And for good reason: people love anime. Welcome to the beginning of crypto gaming animation (side note: Arcane, wow). The team plans to stream the SCARDust comic series on multiple platforms and anticipates a lot of eyeballs glued to screens across the world (Netflix, you there?). They already have big exposure as significant land owners in The Sandbox, and are looking to acquire more as the project unfolds in phases over the next 6-9 months. They‚Äôre checking all the boxes.

To me, $SCARD conjures up an image of a newage Capcom meets Marvel (Mortal Kombat meets x Infinity), ripe for a digital age with play-to-earn crypto gaming communities in places like the Philippines and Asia. I‚Äôm expecting them to amass a community big and strong enough to boost them into $100m+ Market Cap coins. It shouldn‚Äôt take long in my estimation.

The best part? The community has a charitable foundation donating to and raising awareness about mental health education, detecting signs, and seeking help. With the aid of Brandon Vera as their chairman, they‚Äôre promoting mental health awareness through non-profit endeavors.

If you‚Äôre looking for a coin that has it all, I got something for you

At first the name will surprise you that it‚Äôs even still around but hear me out

When it comes to memecoins they‚Äôre usually created around a meme that is established. Think Pepe, wojak, etc 

These are great but what if you could be apart of the meme?  What if you could help build the meme with the community?

Well here enters HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu with the ticker $bitcoin

The content creation is absolutely insane. So much to work with and a dedicated community that have been working nonstop since it‚Äôs launch

They have many slogans but the one that stands out is: the coin who lived. 

Where most memecoins pump and dump within a day or two, harrypotterobamasonic10inu has continued to grow 

Currently sitting around 45-50M MC off it‚Äôs ATH of 95M MC, it looks like a tremendous opportunity to get in before the next leg past 100M MC

Holders are rising every day as the memes and community spreads

Not only does the team want project to succeed financially, but they want to give back and do good in the world

They have already donated to two Nigerian youth soccer teams. Getting them brand new jerseys as well as gear such as shin guards and shoes(soon to be delivered)

I‚Äôd be here for a week straight trying to type everything this project is doing, but this is just a taste

Don‚Äôt just take my word for it, check out their website it is a nostalgic work of art

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Proof of stake explained: Why is it better than Bitcoin‚Äôs PoW?,"As the popularity of cryptocurrency continues to grow, it‚Äôs important to consider the environmental impact of these digital currencies.

One of the most well-known cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, uses a system called Proof of Work (PoW), which requires miners to solve complex mathematical equations to publish new blocks. This process consumes a significant amount of electricity, contributing to the carbon footprint of the currency.

However, there is hope for a more sustainable future for cryptocurrency. Proof of Stake (PoS) is a newer system that requires users to hold a certain amount of cryptocurrency to validate transactions. This reduces the system‚Äôs energy consumption and makes it a more environmentally friendly choice.

A Tale of Two Systems: PoW vs. PoS

Imagine a vast gold mine where hundreds of miners tirelessly dig, not knowing if they‚Äôll find gold or not.

This is the world of Proof of Work ‚Äî a competitive frenzy where participants, or miners, solve complex mathematical problems to publish a new block containing the latest record transactions

The first to solve the problem wins the block reward and publishes the new block, but the combined energy of all those participants, most of whom leave empty-handed, is immense.

Now, multiply that image by thousands ‚Äî representing all the miners worldwide ‚Äî and you can visualize the scale of energy consumption.

Hi guys! You want to retire early? Then invest now: dexIRA  provides fully automated multi-currency dividend rewards, advanced  buyback protocols and tokenomics that promote long term holding and  wealth generation.

Check the Telegram Channel & Website:

üí¨ Telegram: [https://t.me/dexIRA](https://t.me/dexIRA)

üåê Website: [https://dexIRA.com/](https://dexira.com/)

You are searching for a token with a very low market cap? Check this sleeping giant.

üíé An Individual Retirement Account designed specifically for Decentralized Exchanges.

üíé dexIRA is the first token with multi-currency rewards, advanced buyback protocols and

üíé Tokenomics that promote long term hodling and wealth generation.

üöÄ Rewards holders in BNB, BTC, ETH, LINK, DOT, DOGE, SAFEMOON, ADA, BUSD, SAFEMOON and MORE! üéä

The  platform is based on the synergy of two concepts: DEX (decentralized  exchanges) and IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts). Borrowing from the  long-term investment idea behind a traditional IRA, dexIRA investors  can grow their holdings commission-free similar to tax-free IRA  contributions. This allows members to increase their stake in the reward  pool over time without sacrificing initial capital.

After  a one-year holding period, investors can sell their $DEX holdings  tax-free and penalty-free. However, similar to the age restrictions on a  traditional IRA, if holders choose to sell early, they're penalized.

Investors  are protected even when $DEX tokens are sold and the price drops  because they are rewarded with two thirds of all fees collected.  Similarly, the dexIRA contract includes enhanced token buyback protocols  to spur growth and anti-whale measures to prevent large one-off sell  orders.

**Key features of dexIRA**

‚úÖ Get 20% rewards

‚úÖ Automatic Liquidity Pool

‚úÖ Burned LP

‚úÖ Friendly Wale Buyback & Burn

‚úÖ No mint token

‚úÖ Anti Whale Dumps

‚úÖ Auto-claimed Multi-Currency Reflections

‚úÖ No Tax on Buy Orders

‚úÖ No rebase token

‚úÖ Sell tax removed after 1yr hodling

‚úÖ Funds Are Safu

**Whats so special? And why is it mooning?**

The  strategy is simple: Incentivize new investment by waiving fees when  purchasing dexIRA tokens. Support long-term growth by providing rewards  and penalizing speculative short-term traders.

dexIRA  was created to shift the mindset of investors and prove that  cryptocurrencies can be stable, value-appreciating assets if the  tokenomics support a long-term investment goal

Buy  $DEX tokens without fees, use them to automatically collect and manage a  diverse array of curated tokens in the following cryptocurrencies: BNB,  BUSD, BTCB, ETH, DOGE, CAKE, XRP, LITE, LINK, DOT, ADA. SAFEMOON, ATOM,  MATIC, TETHER, 1INCH, BUNNY.

SUPER MISSION is a charity-oriented token on the binance smart chain. Every week, the community elects a new charity to support.

Super Mission only partners with official tax exempt organizations recognized by the IRS.

We will be fully audited. There's no backdoor, so a rug is impossible! That is the promise of our devs, Hamzeh AlAsfar and Ahmad Hussam.

Our mission overview: 

Super Mission is a super hero charity token with intent to generate both profits and charity for people and organizations. We believe profits can change both the lives of investors and the recipients of charity.
‚Äç
Our 10% charity transaction fee is the most generous in the crypto space and will help us take charity to the moon. The 10% charity fee is strategically part of a much larger 15% transaction fee that will prevent whales, discourage panic selling, and quickly replenish the liquidity pool and marketing wallet.
‚Äç
Our token is unique because of our Democratic platform for community members to elect a new charity to support every week. This allows us to support many causes and extend the lifecycle of our token.
‚Äç
We are also unique from other ‚Äúcharity tokens‚Äù due to our commitment to transparency. We will not invent our own ‚Äúcharities‚Äù and we will only work with organizations that are officially recognized as tax exempt 501C3 organizations with the IRS. We will also publish all our donation receipts and even hear from executive directors of non profits, even what from executive directors of nonprofits we partner with.
‚Äç
Our commitment to excellence, transparency, and charity will take us to the moon!


Tokenomics:

Total Supply: 2,000,000,000

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Beyond Protocol -- Bigger than BTC," Over the past month or so, analysts have consistently called [Beyond Protocol](http://beyond.link/) the next top three coin. Examples include [Crypto Rick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U4Dk-rGRkc), [Satoshi Sean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH1N6KWSShA), and [KIFS Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLHgVep3tcI). Although a lot to consider, I generally agreed. This is a team from Stanford, IBM, Cisco, Amazon buoyed by Hollywood execs (it shows in their insane marketing; check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1txFf7Cv8K8) overview video). They are solving a big problem: devices in the future will need to pay each other digitally. The Gartners of the world have said there will be more transactions between devices than humans. 

Then I watched an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCt0R3N9uC4) with the CEO Jonathan Manzi and Tijo Bear. It‚Äôs long --  38 minutes. While I was watching it, it dawned on me that Beyond Protocol will be bigger than Bitcoin. 

Devices don‚Äôt need just to be able to pay each other, they need to be made secure so they can open up to the world. The world can then develop on top of them. Beyond Protocol has built a frictionless technology which can be adopted with one line of code which makes spoofing -- the biggest pain point in cybersecurity right now -- probabilistically impossible. They do this by leveraging hardware signatures and distributed ledgers. Manzi explains it in less than 45s in [this](https://twitter.com/FlameCryptos/status/1404846333861765122) video tweet (watch it, everything will click!)

What Beyond Protocol has built does two critical things. 

First, it makes devices secure for the first time. Now secure, they can open up. And now developers can build applications on top which unite them. Just from a smartphone, Apple‚Äôs App Store brought us applications which changed the way we live: Uber, Instacart, etc. Beyond Protocol‚Äôs Mega App Store will allow developers to build apps on not just an iPhone, but literally every device in the universe. 

Second, it allows devices to pay each other. And the ‚Äúpay each other‚Äù part can get really nuts quickly. It can be autonomous vehicles paying each other for priority in a traffic grid. Or, it can be simply microtransactions which represent the amount of energy expended for a secure message to be sent between devices. Beyond Protocol is literally building the new Internet for devices. They are doing what the biggest companies in the world have tried to do in business consortia over the past decade but failed due to the battle of egos that always goes on -- one company trying to gain dominance over others. Beyond Protocol is opening a can of whoop-ass on all that. They‚Äôre going all open-source protocol, just like ARPA when the internet was started, and they will win. Don‚Äôt bet against an idea which time has come. 

I am a proud member of their Street Team by the way. I will do my best to answer any questions you might have. Some resources below (posted from their Telegram):

Grouper Swap BTC/LTC/DOGE:GROUPER: [grouper.website/?page\_id=2201](https://grouper.website/?page_id=2201)

&#x200B;

Why is it named Grouper? Because there are three lotteries grouped into one!

&#x200B;

\--- What is it? ----

The Grouper Token is a perpetual lottery token hosted on the Binance Smart Chain. There are hourly, daily, and weekly Lottery draws. The amount of Grouper tokens needed to play will be determined by the cost of the coin and overall total holders.  All you must do is have at least the minimum amount to automatically be entered into all the lotteries. 176 Lotteries A Week

Current Min Tokens to Be Entered in Lotteries: 50,000 Grouper

BSC Contract Address: 0x9ce5222a0419cc4d25ece978aaa5d8c31b3565e6

&#x200B;

\--- How do I make money? ---

1. Buy the minimums to play lottery and enjoy community

2. Buy more, become an owner, help steer the project and eventually sell back your tokens to those trying to join at a much higher price + play all the lotteries.

&#x200B;

\--- Why is it different? ---

The supply of Grouper is elastic. You have deflationary pressure when Grouper is traded as there is a 6% tax on every transaction. 5% that is burned, along with the 1% advertising fee (6% total). This helps to reduce supply while also discouraging high speed bots from buying and selling around the lottery times. The Grouper contract is fully published for everyone to read unlike many other lottery tokens on the Binance Smart Chain.

&#x200B;

\--- How can they guarantee winners? --- (THIS SOLVES PROBLEM 1)

Minting coins is not evil, as long as it is explained upfront. To ensure timely lotteries the coins are minted. Hence if transaction volume is low this might cause slight inflation. The max coins awarded per week is equal to 1.5% of the total available coins. The 5% transfer tax easily counteracts this over time.

Many other bsc lotteries die because their volume trails off and they cannot pay lotteries!

&#x200B;

\--- What the heck is GROUPER Swap? --- (SOLVES PROBLEM 2)

Grouper swap allows newer members to bsc to buy in directly with Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Doge coin. (More coins added soon). This allows them to skip pancake swap and all the headaches of converting to bnb and then to the GROUPER lottery token. Imagine when the Doge boys figure out they can join a lottery join FOR LIFE for 50 Doge.

&#x200B;

\--- Simplicity --- (SOLVES PROBLEM 3)

Buy, hold, and win. It is literally that simple. If your wallet holds the minimum amount you are eligible to play all 176 weekly GROUPER lotteries! The minimum amount needed will NEVER go up, only down as the market cap increases. The dev‚Äôs are aiming to peg it at a $25 entry per wallet. So, if you buy more coins make sure to split them into separate wallets so you get more chances to win. (Metamask works great for this). The devs are also working on the website so you will be notified by email, telegram, and TEXT MESSAGE if you win! The weekly lottery is obviously the largest draw, but it is super fun being able to watch all the hourly winners in the chat get excited!

&#x200B;

\--- Published Contract ---

Grouper contract is fully published and the devs answer any questions about it. Please support open source and only contribute to bsc projects that fully publish their contracts!

&#x200B;

\--- What are the tokenomics? ---

The supply of Grouper is elastic. You have deflationary pressure when Grouper is traded as there is a 6% tax on every transaction. 5% that is burned, along with the 1% advertising fee (6% total). This helps to reduce supply while also discouraging high speed bots from buying and selling around the lottery times. The Grouper contract is fully published for everyone to read unlike many other lottery tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. The overall 5% burn results in deflationary pressure. Fair rules, published contract, and fair randomization.

&#x200B;

\--- Can you increase your odds? ---

If I have more Grouper does it increase my chances? No, each wallet has the same chance to win. You can split your wallet into several smaller wallets for better chances as long as they hold the minimum.

&#x200B;

\--- Liquidity lock? Presale? ---

The Grouper presale was 5/30/21 and sold. Liquidity locked until 2022.

&#x200B;

\--- How do I trust GROUPER? ---

Functions allow you to interact directly with GROUPER on the blockchain!

Trust but verify, all GROUPER information can be verified directly on the black chain. Examples include last winner, when the next jackpot is, and how many current holders there are.

&#x200B;

\--- Is there a roadmap? ---

\- Upcoming Mobile App

\- Text Notifications If You Win

\- Expanded Website Integration

\- Influencer Affiliate Program

\- Ethereum 2 Upgrades

&#x200B;

\--- Are you still reading? ---

If you are still reading, I hope you enjoyed learning a little bit about the Grouper project. I got my bags and am waiting for takeoff. I believe the facts presented above clearly explain why Grouper will be here for the long run and outpace all the bsc and crypto lotteries.

Grouper is not trying to be the best bsc lottery‚Ä¶ They are trying to be the best CRYPTO lottery!",2356,2021-06-10 09:03:37,204

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Miners DeFi Coin - MINERS just got major PR In Yahoo News about to go Parabolic I Legit Coin backed by over 115 K in Real BTC Mining Hardware Asics I Insane potential,"I normally trade larger MC coins or invest directly in startups, but every once in a while I come across a real gem in the micro cap space. I wanted to share with all of you in this sub, because I‚Äôve learned so much from this place and hope I can make a real difference in someone‚Äôs life by sharing this alpha. 

$MINERS is a token that pools money to fund cutting-edge Bitcoin mining and pays out BTC rewards to every holder. They already have a mining facility set up with hydropower in Siberia. The founder is a massive influencer and flew to Siberia himself to finalize the partnership setup and film the facilities.

A portion of the tax goes to a mining wallet which then gets used to buy mining hardware. They did a soft launch back in September and acquired over 115K of mining hardware already which is generating a continuous income stream for the coin and its holder. They just completed a massive rebrand process, started major PR (google Miners DeFi and you‚Äôll see) and are about to kick their marketing into high gear. The team has plans to launch an updated live mining dashboard, an NFT platform, a game and a DAO to give the community more control over the token.

We‚Äôre getting in super early so this is SUCH a good bet. Every single coin founded by an influencer has skyrocketed. I hear that they have a massive marketing plan with YouTube videos scheduled for every single day, and they retained a major PR agency called Interdependence. Also, they‚Äôre already starting to go viral on Twitter. This is insane. MC right now is ridiculously low at around 1M and ATH of 5M, this is a really good opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a serious project. 

**Tokenomics**

* 13% transaction tax
   * 4% to mining wallet, which will be returned tenfold to holders after profits
   * 4% reflections/rewards in BTC, meaning all holders will be receiving a passive income!
   * 2% to LP, increasing the stability and value of the coin with each transaction (LP is already super high - normally i‚Äôd think this is low but in the case of $MINERS it works!)
   * 2% to Marketing to provide a stable budget for marketing expenses
* 1 quadrillion total supply -- 50% burned immediately! And constant burns--the coin is hyper-deflationary.
* 20% was sold through the presale, 20% Pancakeswap V2 listing

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,SatOllie's Diaries: from the genesis of Bitcoin until the present day ($BTC on Solana),"**8/8/2024: The Genesis of Bitcoin**
SatOllie here! After reading that token creation on pump fun is now FREE, my mind went into overdrive. A peer-to-peer electronic cash system. A currency that could change everything. I felt this rush of excitement, the same feeling I imagine the original Satoshi had when he penned his Bitcoin whitepaper. I dropped the link in the ""Street Bets"" Discord. Time to see if the world was ready. Spoiler alert: they weren‚Äôt. Not yet.

**9/8/2024: The Slow Drip**
Woke up and checked the chart, expecting to see fireworks... instead, just a few buys trickling in. Street Bets was too busy getting rugged by some presale coin to notice my groundbreaking creation. Classic. Oh well, early days, and patience is key.

**10/8/2024: The Rise Begins**
Boom! We‚Äôre gaining traction! Word has spread about this revolutionary digital currency called Bitcoin, and throughout the morning the buys kept rolling in. By midday, we hit King of the Hill status! We even started a Telegram group, and I‚Äôm feeling this nostalgia vibe - it‚Äôs like the Bitcoin forums and newsgroups all over again. I paid for a Dexscreener listing in anticipation of bonding, and to show my commitment to the project.

**11/8/2024: Jeet and Repeat**
The King of the Hill high didn‚Äôt last long. Some folks jeeted hard, as expected. A lesson learned from the old Bitcoin days: not everyone has diamond hands. But the vibe in our Telegram channel? Electric. It feels like a time machine straight to 2009, with OGs reminiscing about the early Bitcoin days. The community is small, but it‚Äôs mighty.

**12/8/2024: Pump Fun Shenanigans**
Thanks to some generous investors, we now have marketing funds. Time to play with the big boys. We launched a bump bot on pump fun because, let‚Äôs face it, visibility is everything. Market cap‚Äôs creeping towards $60k. Slow but steady wins the race. It‚Äôs crazy watching history repeat itself, but now in this wild west of meme tokens and SOL bonds.

**13/8/2024: The Raydium Rollercoaster**
Someone dropped 30 SOL on $BTC today, finally completing the pump fun bonding curve and launching us on Raydium! It was glorious for about five minutes before they immediately sold off, tanking the price in a sharp drop. Oh, the joys of early crypto markets‚Äîwild swings and instant heartbreak. Onward and upward!

**14/8/2024: Jeet Storm**
$BTC is now live on Raydium! The market cap hit $54k for a hot second before the inevitable jeeting began. Totally normal, and honestly, I‚Äôm not even mad. It‚Äôs part of the process. The thrill of the game keeps me going.

**15-16/8/2024: The Raid Begins**
We‚Äôve built a solid Telegram community‚Äî200 strong and growing! Raids are happening everywhere: Reddit, X, you name it. We‚Äôre making noise. The people need to know about this coin, and we‚Äôre here to make sure they do.

**17-19/8/2024: The Calm After the Storm**
The weekend was quiet‚Äîtoo quiet. Most of the early pump fun buyers have taken their profits and moved on, leaving us at a $13k market cap. But this? This is where the real fun begins. We‚Äôve formed a strong floor, and the diehards remain.

**20/8/2024: The Diamond Hands Chronicles Begin**

The Telegram has become one big LARP, and honestly, we‚Äôre having a blast. Memes, jokes, and talks of the glory days are keeping us going, but make no mistake‚Äîwe‚Äôre still in this for the gains. The dream? To push this market cap high enough that we can all afford some pizza with our $BTC. The laughs are great, but we‚Äôve got our eyes on that moon. Time to rebuild and send it.

**SatOllie out.** üíé‚úã Let‚Äôs keep making history.

Bitcoin ($BTC) is the first LARP-driven memecoin on the Solana network.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,"$EMOTI - A Meme stronger than all, born before BTC even was in mind, and still relevant. Low-Cap, high potential","I've seen my fair share of cryptocurrency projects come and go, but a new player caught my attention recently: Emoti-Coin. This isn‚Äôt just another fleeting pump-and-dump scheme or one. It's a serious contender,¬†**with an hardly engaged community**¬†and with transparent and fully verified developers at the helm.

A real cult coin, powered by the meme library, content maker, staking system, payment system \[where EVERYONE can accept $EMOTI as a currency in their shop\], and many more!

# üìàThe Rise of a New Contender

$EMOTI, is a meme coin on the Solana network, has been steadily climbing the ranks. It‚Äôs more than just a token‚Äîit's part of a broader ecosystem with an already successful Crypto Payment Platform. It' sloaded with tons of launched utility and the community is growing rapidly.

# üë•A Community-Driven Movement

What sets $EMOTI apart is its vibrant and active community. In its current Stage, the project emphasizes conquering the market by empowering its members. The community engages in creating content, promoting the project, and driving social media campaigns. It‚Äôs clear that EMOTI is as much about the people behind it as the technology itself.

**Tokenomics:**

TOTAL TAX: 18%

10% BTC Reflection | 6% Liquidity | 2% Marketing

¬∑ Liquidity Fees are used to boost the Liquidity of the token until 25% Liquidity has been reached. After this, the Fees will be added to the Buyback wallet until the Liquidity is out of balance again.

¬∑ With the Buyback Fee the contract will accumulate BNB to use for a Buyback Event. In this event, the contract will buy Tokens and Burn them afterwards. Sell Fees will be doubled for the duration of 30 minutes to prevent people from dumping.

¬∑ 5% of each transaction is converted into BUSD and sent automatically to the wallets of holders. No more hassle with claim functions!

And you think this is the end of it? During the 1st hour, any sell will result in 30% tax per trade. If you don‚Äôt understand the reason why.. go back to school.

Low MC so do not Miss This Potential x100 Early Gem üíé| Automatic buyback and Burn !! Audited by TechRate! Hold $VTC and receive double King assets BTC + ETH","# VitalikNakamoto is Coming....Soon !

üî•The most awaited BSC token ever! Finally here !  


**üì£PRESALE August 19th 10:00 AM UTC**

  
**Why VitalikNakamoto ($VTC) name?** Because, as they are the Crypto King assets, and made for long term holders, we came up with the same project idea aiming long term, and to be on the same page, the liquidity is locked !  
VitalikNakamoto brings passive Income for holders. Simply hold $VTC tokens and get rewarded in $BTC as well as $ETH on every transaction!

Vitalik Nakamoto is the true heir of Bitcoin and Ethereum, $VTC is an outstanding token that will pay to its holders both BTC and ETH just by holding it in their wallet. Hold VTC and receive BTC&ETH automatically in your wallet.  

With Vitalik Nakamoto Coin ($VTC) you earn Bitcoin and Ethereum in your wallet. On every transaction during any swap, a percentage of the transaction fees of the $VTC token swap process, BTC&ETH will be redistributed among the holders as a reward.  

The Token has an anti-whale and anti-dump feature system, which will limit the amount of tokens investors can buy and the amount of tokens they can sell accordingly. On every transaction a percentage of the token will also be burned, reducing the total supply available and contributing to the asset scarcity.  

The formula is quite simple. On every transaction:   
‚ÄúX%‚Äù will be allocated to holders Reward (in BTC and ETH);   
‚ÄúY%‚Äù to Project Liquidity as a Buyback;  
And last but not least ‚ÄúZ%‚Äù to deflationary Burn.

Private Sale: 5.000.000 (5%)   
üî• Initial Burn: 15%  


**What makes VitalikNakamoto standing out frmo others?**  
Vitalik Nakamoto Coin is a BTC and ETH Reflection token, so you get both BTC and ETH directly to your wallet by just holding VitalikNakamoto Coin (VTC). It is also designed with a BuyBack system that helps avoid dips. After each BuyBack, transaction fees for SELLS are doubled for 120 minutes, descending to the original rate with each minute. And last but not least, if liquidity exceeds 25% of the Mcap, the auto-liquidity fee will be used to feed the BuyBack wallet. Sounds good, doesn't it?

üéñÔ∏è When bitcoin and Elon together, it will make life better!üéñÔ∏è 

üåü Welcome to ElonEarnBTCüåü 

ElonEarnBTC is the token where holders can get BTC by holding ElonEarnBTC. Yes, you heard it right, you will get BTC right onto your wallet as simple as you hold ElonEarnBTC. As for other project, rewards is not significant, we step up the game by rewards holder the best thing ever which is BITCOIN where 7% will be distributed among our community.

üéñÔ∏è How do I claim BTC rewards?

Simple, just buy and hold 200,000 of ElonEarnToken and start receiving you r BTC rewards.As simple as that. The more tokens you buy and hold the more BTC rewards you get. With that, it indirectly provides the secondary, or what we call passive income of 7% of Bitcoin distribution.

üéñÔ∏è Okay, this is a good deal, but how do I check my rewards?

Nice question there!

You can add BTC-B Binance Pegged Token 123445566778888 to your wallet and wallah, you can view your rewards there.

üéñÔ∏è I‚Äôm tired of project claims there is a rewards project. Is ElonEarnBTC is a trustworthy project?

This is a common worried to investors since there's a lot of rug project nowadays. With the Stealth launch and small initial Market cap, theres is a safe project for you to invest with. With LP locked when we launch the project, this will be an additional safety measure. We also directly listing ElonEarnBTC in Coingecko and CMC with a fast-track deal.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,MINERS just released a major statement about NYC mayor Eric Adams BTC mining controversy I They have a solution to make BTC mining 100% green and profitable I Backed by over 115K in Real BTC Mining Hardware Asics I Insane potential,"I normally trade larger MC coins or invest directly in startups, but every once in a while I come across a real gem in the micro cap space. I wanted to share with all of you in this sub, because I‚Äôve learned so much from this place and hope I can make a real difference in someone‚Äôs life by sharing this alpha. 

$MINERS is a token that pools money to fund cutting-edge Bitcoin mining and pays out BTC rewards to every holder. They already have a mining facility set up with hydropower in Siberia. The founder is a massive influencer and flew to Siberia himself to finalize the partnership setup and film the facilities.

A portion of the tax goes to a mining wallet which then gets used to buy mining hardware. They did a soft launch back in September and acquired over 115K of mining hardware already which is generating a continuous income stream for the coin and its holder. They just completed a massive rebrand process, started major PR (google Miners DeFi and you‚Äôll see) and are about to kick their marketing into high gear. The team has plans to launch an updated live mining dashboard, an NFT platform, a game and a DAO to give the community more control over the token.

They‚Äôve also just jumped into the controversy around NYC‚Äôs mayor criticizing BTC mining, and said on their Medium page that they have a solution, or better, that they \*are\* the solution for all the issues he brought up with BTC mining and sustainability. I expect this will make huge waves.   
We‚Äôre getting in super early so this is SUCH a good bet. Every single coin founded by an influencer has skyrocketed. I hear that they have a massive marketing plan with YouTube videos scheduled for every single day, and they retained a major PR agency called Interdependence. Also, they‚Äôre already starting to go viral on Twitter. This is insane. MC right now is ridiculously low at around 1M and ATH of 5M, this is a really good opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a serious project. 

**Tokenomics**

* 13% transaction tax
   * 4% to mining wallet, which will be returned tenfold to holders after profits
   * 4% reflections/rewards in BTC, meaning all holders will be receiving a passive income!
   * 2% to LP, increasing the stability and value of the coin with each transaction (LP is already super high - normally i‚Äôd think this is low but in the case of $MINERS it works!)
   * 2% to Marketing to provide a stable budget for marketing expenses
* 1 quadrillion total supply -- 50% burned immediately! And constant burns--the coin is hyper-deflationary.
* 20% was sold through the presale, 20% Pancakeswap V2 listing

&#x200B;

**Liquidity Fee:**

\-We have also implemented a tax of 2% on each buy & 4% of each sell transaction to be added back into the liquidity pool. This will provide us a stronger floor and give a bigger incentive to hold.

&#x200B;

**Marketing Fee:**

\-3% of each buy & 6% of each sell transaction will be automatically sent in BTC (so we don't lose value at the same time) to a wallet which is going to be used strictly for marketing and development of Xmas Floki.

&#x200B;

**Audit**

\-After launch we will submit for an audit and it will be done in the upcoming week.

&#x200B;

**Xmas Floki Tokenomics:**

\-Total Supply - 1T

\-Network - BEP20

\-Team Wallet - 5%

&#x200B;

**Total Tax:** 

\- 13 % Buy (5% Rewards, 3% Lottery, 2% Liquidity, 3% Marketing)

\- 22 % Sell  (7% Rewards, 5% Lottery,  4% Liquidity, 6% Marketing)

üëâ What is the Ethernal finance token exactly?

A community-driven DeFi Token with an innovative reflections functionality and a focus on continuous, sustainable growth. Their main objective is to offer as much value and utility to our users as possible.

Their initial launch goal is to provide passive income to the holders, but that‚Äôs only the first step. They aim to build a true Ethernal ecosystem with many exciting features planned for the near future. Some examples include: governance mechanisms that will enable you to have a say in the project decisions, a cross-chain NFT Marketplace where you can buy, sell, mint, and showcase your NFTs, and a fully-fledged DEX with yield farming - all of which will be connected to the Ethernal token, always generating new revenue streams for the holders!

üëâ How Ethernal finance works:

Simply hold 1,000,000 or more Ethernal tokens and get rewarded in any coin you want, directly to your wallet, every day. All you need to do is claim your winnings in the Ethernal rewards page, and the more you hold, the higher the rewards. Three functions occur during each trade which fuel the Ethernal ecosystem:

‚úÖ Reflection: 7% is reflected to all holders for passive income paid in any coin of your choosing via BEP20 TOKEN (example: USDC/BNB/BTC/ETH), meaning that 7% of every buy/sell is taken and redistributed to all Ethernal holders. Hold Ethernal, earn top-tier tokens of your choice!

‚úÖ LP Acquisition: 5% is added to a liquidity pool on Pancakeswap, increasing the token stability. LP tokens created out of the contract are burned to create a steadily rising floor price.

‚úÖ Marketing: 3% is allocated to marketing efforts designed to achieve a continuous and sustainable growth

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,üé∂The BabyMusk Songüé∂ is driving everyone crazy. $BABYMUSK is the ultimate Baby coin with one main goal: being mentioned and possibly adopted by Elon Musk. Hold $BABYMUSK and gain rewards in BTC. ‚úÖ Audited.,"Hi guys, for those who don‚Äôt know me, I made a fortune this summer with Baby coins. I participated to the presales of Baby Shark, Baby Doge coin, Mini Doge, Baby Cake and Baby BTC and that made me over 7 figures.
Lately I‚Äôve noticed that not many interesting Baby coins have emerged, until I found this gem with a massive viral potential.

Baby Musk coin is a hyper-deflationary token that can easily become the ultimate Baby coin in the crypto universe.

üî• https://youtu.be/KAgJCaz55Pc
This is the coolest thing I have seen in a while: They made a BabyShark-like theme song with a music video. It‚Äôs currently going viral and thousands of people are sending clips of their kids dancing to it.

üî• www.babymuskcoin.com
Their website is absolutely top-notch, and by holding $BABYMUSK tokens you get BTC rewards every hour in your wallet.

üî• 
This is the earliest time to get in: it‚Äôs not even possible to buy yet, since they haven‚Äôt launched either their pre-sale or public sale, nor they have listed the token on PCS.

üî• Shilling: https://t.me/babymusknewsofficial/8

üî• Telegram: https://t.me/babymuskcoinofficial
As of now, there is only 3 chances to gain an actually quite large bag of tokens:
Taking part to their airdrop contest (up to $500),
Taking part to their shilling contests (up to $5000),
Being on the weekly top 10 of their most active members in their telegram chat (starting on Dec 28 at 8pm EST).

üèÜ A single participant can win up to $5k in tokens before launch.

üéØ $BabyMusk has indeed one primary goal: being mentioned and possibly adopted by Elon Musk. Everything revolves around this, and the community is super committed to make it together.
They also have projects for Musk-themed table games, a killer wallet app and launching stablecoins pegged to stocks on the Binance Smart Chain.

Safety:

‚úÖ Private sale runs on Babymuskcoin.com from Jan 2nd until Jan 20th. Unsold tokens will be burned by the team.

‚úÖ Presale runs on PinkSale from Jan 21st to Jan 23rd. Unsold tokens will be burned.

‚úÖ 100% of liquidity tokens will be automatically locked by Pinksale for one year.

‚úÖ Dev tokens are locked on PinkSale and cannot be sold.

‚úÖ The contract is audited by Ether Authority and is already public. 

‚úÖ The $420k seed round has already been closed and the Marketing wallet has been funded according to the use of funds table.

Very Soon !

üî•The most awaited BSC token ever! Finally here !  


**üì£PRESALE August 19th 10:00 AM UTC**

  
**Why VitalikNakamoto ($VTC) name?** Because, as they are the Crypto King assets, and made for long term holders, we came up with the same project idea aiming long term, and to be on the same page, the liquidity is locked !  
VitalikNakamoto brings passive Income for holders. Simply hold $VTC tokens and get rewarded in $BTC as well as $ETH on every transaction!

Vitalik Nakamoto is the true heir of Bitcoin and Ethereum, $VTC is an outstanding token that will pay to its holders both BTC and ETH just by holding it in their wallet. Hold VTC and receive BTC&ETH automatically in your wallet.

With Vitalik Nakamoto Coin ($VTC) you earn Bitcoin and Ethereum in your wallet. On every transaction during any swap, a percentage of the transaction fees of the $VTC token swap process, BTC&ETH will be redistributed among the holders as a reward.

The Token has an anti-whale and anti-dump feature system, which will limit the amount of tokens investors can buy and the amount of tokens they can sell accordingly. On every transaction a percentage of the token will also be burned, reducing the total supply available and contributing to the asset scarcity.

The formula is quite simple. On every transaction:  
‚ÄúX%‚Äù will be allocated to holders Reward (in BTC and ETH);  
‚ÄúY%‚Äù to Project Liquidity as a Buyback;  
And last but not least ‚ÄúZ%‚Äù to deflationary Burn.

**What makes VitalikNakamoto standing out frmo others?**  
Vitalik Nakamoto Coin is a BTC and ETH Reflection token, so you get both BTC and ETH directly to your wallet by just holding VitalikNakamoto Coin (VTC). It is also designed with a BuyBack system that helps avoid dips. After each BuyBack, transaction fees for SELLS are doubled for 120 minutes, descending to the original rate with each minute. And last but not least, if liquidity exceeds 25% of the Mcap, the auto-liquidity fee will be used to feed the BuyBack wallet. Sounds good, doesn't it?

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Batcat | The hero we didn't know we needed | $BTC ,"Hello fellow Redditors and crypto enthusiasts üöÄ

Have you guys been keeping an eye on Batcat? Batman is quickly becoming the latest craze on Twitter and Batcat is proving to be more than just a whisker in the crypto world. This caped crusader is on a mission to protect the streets of Soltham City from the villains behind scams and fraud.

Three months in as a CTO and the Batcat community is holding strong, with 4600 holders and over 2000 members on Telegram. We are now also live on CMC!
The Batcat community? They're the real MVP's. A bunch of cool cats who are all about supporting each other and pushing this project to new heights. With a current Market Cap of 200k  Batcat is a hidden gem with huge potential.

Recently Batcat has been starting to creep out of the shadows and make himself known, in not only the crypto world but in the world of Batman and comics. 
Kelley Jones, the artist known for his iconic Batman illustrations, has approved Batcat and reposted a tweet about our favourite crypto kitty! It's like the world of comic books and crypto have collided in the coolest crossover event üòª
It's a sign that our little hero is making waves beyond the crypto world.

Be sure to follow Batcat on Twitter to keep up to date with the latest. Spaces are held every Monday and Batcat is also often in Spaces with other communities.

Stay tuned, and remember, always be yourself - unless you can be Batcat. Then always be Batcat ü¶áüêà‚Äç‚¨õ

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,MINERS DeFi I Massive NFT campaign ANNOUNCED I About to go Parabolic I BTC Income from every Tx I Backed by over 115K in Real BTC Mining Hardware Asics I Insane potential,"Up until recently BTC mining rewards were only accessible to mega whales and mining conglomerates like Bitmain and Peernova. When normal people wanted to mine BTC, they had to invest tons of money into hardware and would barely break even with costs of electricity being very high. Miners DeFi has developed a solution to change all this. The protocol has been running since September of 2021. It‚Äôs run by a collective for sustainable BTC mining and powers a sustainable mining operation in Siberia.   
**How it Works:**   
A percentage of the transaction tax from every $MINERS buy and sell is used to acquire new Asics miners, in partnership with CyberianMine, one of the leading BTC mining companies based out of Berlin, Germany.   
The miners are on 24/7 and mine BTC on behalf of the collective.   
The mining income then gets distributed to $MINERS token holders on a regular basis through buybacks and burns that increase the value of the coins held, and the group is working on a direct distribution mechanism as well. 

In addition to income from the mining operation, holders also earn Bitcoin on every transaction. There is a 4% tax that gets distributed directly to all current holders whenever a new person joins the collective by buying MINERS tokens. So basically, holders are guaranteed to make money in several ways. 

&#x200B;

**What sets Miners DeFi apart:**   
‚úîÔ∏è Proven track record (running since Sept 21, over 115K of miners already acquired) 

‚úîÔ∏è Fully doxxed founder who‚Äôs a longtime influencer in crypto/finance   


‚úîÔ∏è 100% transparency via regular community chats and 24/7 live stats on mining   


‚úîÔ∏è Insane branding and proof of mining operations (videos and in-depth info on their operation are available on their channels)   


‚úîÔ∏è Legit PR coverage in major publications (just search for Miners DeFi)   


After a long phase of building and preparing the next push, Miners DeFi just announced a massive NFT drop for new holders that buy over the course of the next month. Those NFTs are legit fire and it looks like they‚Äôre about to drop a huge promotion campaign around the holders giveaway. Feels like the early days of Bonfire and Safemoon. The calm before things go completely insane. 

This coin is so cheap right now, it‚Äôs kind of ridiculous. Some early holder whales needed cash and have been suppressing the chart for a while, but they‚Äôre finally completely out. IMO this is easily 100X - 1000X undervalued AS OF RIGHT NOW given it has underlying assets already, and is bound to go up no matter what (because it has BTC income).   
**Tokenomics**

* 13% transaction tax
   * 4% to mining wallet, which will be returned tenfold to holders after profits
   * 4% reflections/rewards in BTC, meaning all holders will be receiving a passive income!
   * 2% to LP, increasing the stability and value of the coin with each transaction (LP is already super high - normally i‚Äôd think this is low but in the case of $MINERS it works!)
   * 2% to Marketing to provide a stable budget for marketing expenses
* 1 quadrillion total supply -- 50% burned immediately! And constant burns--the coin is hyper-deflationary.
* 20% was sold through the presale, 20% Pancakeswap V2 listing

DaddyBoost Smart BuyBack üöÄ
DaddyBoost Protocol is built mathematically to do variable buybacks which will adjust based on volume in order to maintain coin‚Äôs stability. DaddyBoost will vary based on the transactions over the past 24 hours which will continue to get adjusted depending on the volume.
DaddyBoost will buy back different amounts every time a sale occurs with $BDDoge Coin. This mathematical correction is much more powerful than any standard buyback system. Our devs have worked extremely hard on this and the system was tested several times on Testnet and Mainnet before getting implemented.
Total Buy Fee: 12%

1. **Market Cap on the Rise**: After a bumpy launch after transitioning from pump fun to Raydium, $BTC has seen its market cap organically grow from just 13k to nearly 24k in the last 7 days, with the majority of this growth happening over the last 24 hours. This signals that the early pump fun profit-takers are out and the diamond handed chads remain.
2. **Thriving Community**: Our Telegram group is now 270 members strong, filled with an active, LARP-driven community that‚Äôs more engaged and passionate than many $1M+ coins.¬†¬†Join us and be a part of something special!
3. **Growing Numbers**: We‚Äôve got 177 followers on X (formerly Twitter) and 183 $BTC holders on-chain.¬†¬†The momentum is building, and you can be part of it!
4. **First E-Commerce Partner**: The online marketplace Silk Road has chosen Bitcoin ($BTC) as its primary form of currency! While access from our country is blocked, rumor has it they‚Äôre selling various kinds of tea from around the world.¬†
5. **CEX Listing**: Bitcoins CEX listing with Mt. Gox is just around the corner! Soon, you‚Äôll have a secure place to exchange and store your Bitcoins.¬†
6. **$100k+ Market Cap incoming:** Markets are turning back to memecoins, and with the strength of the community the $BTC chart should have no problem reaching $100k and beyond!

üí∏ Higher Tax for Larger Transactions üí∏

Any transaction greater than 0.1% of the supply incurs a 30% tax; this discourages large dumps and large buys, reducing the number of whales.

&#x200B;

üí∏ Max amount of transaction set to 0.2%: üí∏

A transaction greater than 0.2% of the supply will not be possible. This will prevent massive dumps by whales and deter large bot purchases on launch.

&#x200B;

üí∏ Max cap per wallet set to 0.7%: üí∏

No one wallet can hold greater than 0.7% of the supply. This will mean that the top wallet distributions will be kept healthy, and no one wallet can create a considerable price impact. However, if a wallet holds 0.7% of the supply, their wallet will still benefit from the auto-staking through the redistribution.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,"BTC Bull - To be listed on coinhunt.cc tonight, going to ""Promoted coins"" | Referral contest with NFT started | Holding the floor | Did more than 340x | Experienced devs | Diamond hands holders |","Brought to you by 2 experienced developers, TheMakkk (Max) and LDLD

Written with a clean quality solidity code.

So LDLD is a developer who already launched 1 token 3 weeks ago, his first token name was ApeCoinBSC, it was a low MC token too, it went from 350$ MC to 8200$ MC, which is not bad at all for his first one, you know how BSC is.

Max launched 3 tokens, this will be the 4th, you can find all the info in his announcements channel: [https://t.me/MakkksAnnouncements](https://t.me/MakkksAnnouncements)

This one is promising to have more attention, first of all because of the BTC rewards and Low MC, people getting in at that low MC will be able to become whales with full max wallet which will be 3%.

Why BTC? Because BTC broke All Time High (ATH) ! This means a new bullish trend is starting around bitcoin, that's why they chose the name BTC Bull.

**Basic information about BTC Bull:**

* \- Total supply: 100,000,000,000
* \- Max Transaction (Buy/Sell) - 1% - 1,000,000,000 Tokens
* \- Max Wallet - 3% - 3,000,000,000 Tokens

**Token Economics:**

* \- 10% Bitcoin rewards - just hold the BTC Bull token and receive BTC in your wallet.
* \- 5% Auto Liquidity - to ensure a stable chart.
* \- 5% Marketing - at some point the marketing has to hit to develop the project.

Anyway this could become a juicy GEM with a big potential of hitting 100x and more because the Market Cap will be low, devs are trusted and the rewards are insane!

‚úÖUnique tokenomics that allow for Mindless Mining 

Mother BTC has learned and taught her children the following. 

LESSON #1

>If you want something to be of value, you‚Äôve got to make it rare. BTC has 21 million coins. MoBTC has 21,000 tokens and we burned 10% and no more will ever be minted in this smart contract making it a true store of value currency.

LESSON #2

>Make your money earn money (especially when you sleep) with Mindless Mining - if you HODL $MoBTC you will earn 5% on ALL transactions via our Mindless Mining protocol, which distributes back proportionally to all HODLERs

LESSON #3

>Andy Warhol once said, ‚ÄúDon't think about making art, just get it done. Let everyone else decide if it's good or bad, whether they love it or hate it. While they are deciding, make even more art.‚Äù - We plan on attracting rare artists to create one of a kind pieces for our NFT site

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,BTC | A micro-cap token on Solana with 1000x potential. Miss out buying bitcoin in 2009? Don‚Äôt make the same mistake again,"It's 2009, you are still feeling the pinch of the 2008 market crash. Your wife is hungry and her boyfriend is trying to move in with you because he lost his job. It's a simpler time. All of a sudden you start hearing whispers on the internet of some strange internet money, it's called bit-coin?! 

You find yourself in a group on some weird Russian hacking app called Telegram and find that it's being run by some cult, all they do is speak gibberish about buying pizza with these internet points. You aren't too sure, but you don't want to let these Russian propagandists win! 

You decide to ape $50 dollars and forget about it. 10 years pass and you are no longer married and your now ex-wife is calling you from her ex-boyfriends house and asking if she can move back in with you. You are startled by the idea because you haven't fucked anyone in nearly 9 years since she left you for drawing dicks on pizza charts for the russians. It's all a blur but she tells you that one of your bitcoins is worth $9,642 üò± 

Now 10 years on, your wife is back and she's left her ex-boyfriend and things are worse than ever!

SO WHY NOT APE INTO $BTC ON $SOL TODAY AND YOU CAN RUIN YOUR LIFE TOO!

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,Introducing Baby Satoshi: the first & only BITCOIN reflection token üöÄ. Now with increased BTC reflections of 11%! Sitting at only $1.4m MC BabySats is the next 100x,"Introducing Baby Satoshi: the first & only BITCOIN reflection token üöÄ 
 
Since the last post was made on Baby Satoshi the market cap has almost tripled and is now sitting at $1.4M, almost triple since this token was last posted about on CMS. Baby Satoshi is also current trending on Dex Tools top trending #6. The dev has talked about Btok marketing coming soon and tweets from big influencers like LilMoon and others have been happening regularly.  

The marketing budget for this token is huge and the team is ready to take it 100m with the right team and marketing behind it. Baby Satoshi is the first token to get listed on CMC and CG in under 6 hours and the liquidity pool of $400,000 for a $1.4 million market cap token is too good. This has potential to go to 10m+ easily. Im calling it here now get in and start earning BTC as passive income.  

Love it or hate it, ü™ô Bitcoin has become synonymous with the cryptocurrency world ‚Äî but if we hope to survive the tumultuous market unscathed, we need to get a little creative. That‚Äôs why we made BabySatoshi on BSC. BabySatoshi is the first and only token that automatically pays holders with Bitcoin reflection rewards. 

Why Bitcoin? Everyone knows that Bitcoin is king. The halving jumpstarts the bull market every few years. Altcoins' success is dependent on Bitcoin market sentiment. Everyone's trying to stack those sats and accumulate more Bitcoin. When the market starts tanking, Bitcoin tanks much less than other altcoins, making it the perfect crypto to collect. The best part about BabySatoshi is that you accumulate more Bitcoin when it's cheaper, so you benefit more during bearish conditions. So, it seemed like a no-brainer that Bitcoin would become the perfect payout incentive. tl;dr If you believe in Bitcoin, you better believe in BabySatoshi as well. 

Tokenomics Total supply is 100,000 $SATS. No more can be minted. 

Initially Baby Satoshi had a 8% distribution to holders but upon building a bigger liquidity pool has increased rewards to 11% for holders! So now you get even more BTC for holding baby Satoshi? 
 
Fee breakdown 11% automatically distributed to holders as BTC 4% automatically added to liquidity 3% marketing and development 

Contract: 0xa1d04a189f8b6d5d64e8fea7c38846ab6fa0f823 

Initial liquidity has been locked for 10 years on UniCrypt. LP Lock: https://app.unicrypt.network/amm/pancake-v2/pair/0x8678319c6876af75cd5bf5e5a720b9a6635d6522

**Tokenomics:**

10% BTC Reflection | 6% Liquidity | 2% Marketing 

¬∑ Liquidity Fees are used to boost the Liquidity of the token until 25% Liquidity has been reached. After this, the Fees will be added to the Buyback wallet until the Liquidity is out of balance again.

¬∑ With the Buyback Fee the contract will accumulate BNB to use for a Buyback Event. In this event, the contract will buy Tokens and Burn them afterwards. Sell Fees will be doubled for the duration of 30 minutes to prevent people from dumping.

¬∑ 5% of each transaction is converted into BUSD and sent automatically to the wallets of holders. No more hassle with claim functions!

And you think this is the end of it? During the 1st hour, any sell will result in 30% tax per trade. If you don‚Äôt understand the reason why.. go back to school.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,$BTC | Top 5 reasons to buy Bitcoins on Solana + 8M BTC Giveaway,"Hey everyone!

Are you tired of just owning a fraction of a Bitcoin and feeling left out of the whale club? Well, do I have some news for you. Bitcoin on Solana ($BTC) lets you own 1 million bitcoins for just under $11 USD.

Sure, we're under a $10k market cap, but hear me out... here are some solid reasons to buy in:

1. **Clout and prestige:** the BTC balance in your Solana wallet is almost indistinguishable from the real thing. Use this to gain entry into the most exclusive events, test drive luxury cars and hang with the upper echelon of society.
2. **Practice Your Diamond Hands:** Train yourself to hold during market crashes without any real financial pain ‚Äî it's like Bitcoin on training wheels!
3. **The Culture:** the $BTC community on Telegram consists of the most cultured members from communities such as $HEGE, $CTHULHU, $NANCYCOIN & $BOMBO. They are in it for the unlimited LARPing potential (it's like stepping back to 2009).
4. **Literally Unruggable:** I know this gets thrown around a lot, but it's now over 19 days since $BTC graduated the pump fun trenches and launched on Raydium. If it was a rug, it would have happened by now. The dev holds less than 3% of supply, which is barely enough to make a dent.
5. **More satisfying than building the LEGO¬Æ Harry Potter set:** building a blockchain is infinitely more satisfying (and affordable than playing with those those plastic blocks.

# 8M Bitcoin Giveaway

The 8 million bitcoin giveaway is still running until September 13th! Head over to our Tropee page, complete some simple tasks and enter for a chance to win:

# Bitcoin v0.4.0 Released!

Exciting news! We've just released Bitcoin v0.4.0! This new version comes packed with features and improvements that are going to take Bitcoin to the next level. Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

* **Passphrase security:** We've added encryption to the wallet.dat file! Your BTC is now safer than ever. Encrypt your wallet with a passphrase to protect it from prying eyes and potential attacks.

‚û°Ô∏è 3 main features of autoPay Crypto:

* Automated reward system for holding autoPay tokens as ANY BSC token the community decides.  
The distributed reward token (for 48 hours) will be determined in Telegram polls.  
How will this work?  
We contact other project owners, tell them that we want to add them to our current reward poll and if they win the poll, their token will be distributed to autoPay holders for the next 48 hours as reward for holding autoPay.. in exchange, they advertise our poll in their Telegram channel and tell their investors to join our group and vote for their token.  
To prevent any voting fraud, only votes from voters which join the official autoPay chat will be counted.
* Automated buy-back bot which will buy back autoPay tokens and send them to the burn address immediately.
* 20 BNB charity donations to Binance charities for each $1 Million market cap milestones reached (20 BNB at 1 Million, 20 BNB at 2 Million, 20 BNB at 3 Million etc.).

üî∏ Mechanics and Features üî∏

‚úÖ Multi Coin Rewards - Pick a coin, any coin! We offer 5 major coins and a rotation of community voted coins for claiming
 

‚úÖ The NFT Vault - 
 The Vault is a separate storage pool that can hold other assets of value such as NFT's. With our planned exclusive partnerships, you will have the ability to mint a limited number of NFT's when claiming our partners' tokens, enter lottery draws to win NFT's and much more. 

‚úÖ Gas Fee waiver for small investors - 
We are offering a helping hand to the small investors. If your daily reward is less than the fee in gas, then we will pay the gas fee for you. Aren't we nice?!?

‚úÖ Dynamic Tax Protocol - The Dynamic Tax Protocol is back!
DTP refills the liquidity pool when needed and prioritises up 13% of the total transaction tax to the reward pool when liquidity is healthy.

‚úÖ Reward Contributions - Because giving back to the community is a good thing!
Reward Contributions ensure the biggest earners contribute their fair share back to the pool for everyone else to enjoy.

‚úÖ Anti-Dump Mechanism - Selling = Good. Manipulation = Bad.
Selling is a healthy part of any marketplace, but any one individual should not be allowed to manipulate the market for their own personal gain. We have reintroduced and revised our amazing 24 hour Anti-Dump mechanic to ensure even more tax diverts to the pool, while still encouraging normal selling activity! 

‚úÖ Smart Pool Mechanism - 
A dynamic portion of all transaction taxes, as well all as Anti-Dump taxes will continuously keep the smart pool topped up. Any excess rewards in the smart pool are transferred back to the reward pool to be shared by all and if the reward pool is smaller than the previous 24 hour period, the smart pool will top up the difference!

&#x200B;

Fat Rewards in Bitcoin

&#x200B;

FATOSHI loves his tasty bitcoins and he wants to share them with you. Where does the name come from? ""Fat"" is the way rewards should be and ""Toshi"" is from Satoshi, the smallest unit of a bitcoin. The Satoshi to Bitcoin ratio is 100 million to satoshis to ONE Bitcoin and every satoshi received directly in your wallet is a fraction of the most powerful cryptocurrency as of now. 

&#x200B;

Among thousands of memetokens, FatSatoshi (aka FATOSHI) was born, thought of in the mallest details to bring to its holders the latest in tokenomics. The idea is to show that the meme family is growing, however, real quality is here, designed so that the results  of trades are always favorable. All tokenomics were thought to achieve the perfect balance for better results. Higher prices and green candles, this is what really matters and this is what every holder looks for.

&#x200B;

üèß 10% FAT Passive Income in Bitcoin:

Auto-send massive rewards in BTC (BITCOIN), distributed among the holders.

&#x200B;

üó£ 3% Heavy Marketing:

Marketing is taken seriously and will be aggressive. Poocoin and Dextools adds already in the oven and roadmap full of consistent actions.

&#x200B;

üíß 2% Add to Liquidity Pool:

Auto-send back to the LP, assuring price empowerment.

&#x200B;

‚úÖ WHITELIST is guaranteed with 80 points on the bounty. This means 20% more tokens then listing.

üéÅ Airdrawps Wallet is used to draw BTC between the holders and to attract new members.

If you ask me this is a lot better than investing in a one day token that may collapse within minutes of launch... Now that SAFE ETH has proven it's actually safe, by surviving all this time, getting listed at various places, etc... When any of the other ""Safe"" things 

will pump, Safe ETH will gigapump since it's a much lower mcap. Don't say I didn't warn you...

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,"Folks, I wanna chat about somethin' that's been buzzin in my head lately - RWA (Real World Assets) and how the crypto sentiment has totally flipped after the BTC ETF approval. It's like overnight, crypto went from being a SCAM to full-blown mainstream madness.","We're talkin about all big funds not just dipping their toes, but apeing into crypto and eager to bag those eye-watering returns.  
  
Just a year back it was a whole different ball game. The general vibe was disbelief in crypto, with many giving crypto the side-eye, hesitant to jump in. But oh, how the tables have turned. Now, it's like the entire financial world has finally started respecting what the crypto industry brings to the table. And with that respect? Money is flowing like crazy. I think we have passed the disbelief phase of the crypto cycle.   
  
When things are changing rapidly, I've been noodling over the next big narrative that will print 100x returns for noobies like me. The RWA kept poppin up in my mind. And here's why: It's a sector that was practically off-limits a year ago, but now? It's super big - we're talking a whopping almost $16 Trillion market. That's the kind of opportunity you don't just walk by.  
  
So, why RWA? Because it is the next possible big disruption after AI. We've seen hints and nods from the top guys of the banking and finance world. Take the Blackrock CEO - when someone of that high position talks about tokenization being the future, you sit up and listen. Because who else do you think is worth listening to and take hints from? That's my cue to start moving heavily and aggressively into spaces that are prepped and primed for this shift.  
  
That's why I'm setting my sights on undervalued gems in the RWA sphere, specifically targeting projects with a market cap under $400M, thats the sweet spot. Projects under $100m mcap are risky that they can die or run away. If you are up for that risk go for it. And everybody knows projects that are $1bn-$2bn-$3bn wont print you more than 2x but yah everybody has different goals and can decide for themselves. But $400m mcap ones is my sure 10x spot. So It's these under-the-radar players that are likely to give the most bang for your buck. And right now, $ONDO & $OM are looking like the perfect candidates. They're not just potential winners; they're potential goldmines, ready for an easy 10x jump when the RWA wave truly begins to swell  
  
So, to all my fellow crypto traders, what's your angle? Are you also sensing the RWA surge, or is it only me? Let's dive into this crazy, money flowing into the crypto world like crazy and make the most of it together.",75,2024-03-01 15:27:48,18
BTC,CryptoMoonShots,"The fastest growing token EVER on BSC, Saturna hit a $10M market cap under five hours, 3,000 holders in half a day. Less than 24h old, what are you waiting for??","Welcome to the twilight zone folks. If you don‚Äôt recall the 2017 bull run, then understand you‚Äôre in for a treat. With top 10 coins pumping wildly right now but BTC starting to flag in relation, the tide is about to come in and push all our favorite shitcoins to their absolute limit.

**Saturna** is here in the **right place** and at the **right time** which is why it hit eight figures shortly after launching and looks on track to be the talk of BSC as the fastest growing token anyone‚Äôs seen. Seriously, beyond utility-based projects which never see this kind of growth, you‚Äôre talking about **a token that‚Äôs mooned faster than Hoge, SafeMOON, and Bonfire.**

With an absolutely killer website, already a strong TG community, and achievements coming at holder-based intervals Saturna looks primed to blast off this week, making a **jump to a $100M** market cap reasonable from its **current BUY THE FUCKING DIP price of $6M.** 

I mean, **try to find another token that has experienced this much growth, this quickly,** and didn‚Äôt make a huge run within the first week. I‚Äôll save your lazy ass the time, **there is none, flat out doesn‚Äôt exist**. Saturna is your big chance to actually be early on the next token to make the newsroom rounds so you can brag about how you weren‚Äôt just a first adopter to cryptocurrency, but knew where to find the best gains.

Because while it‚Äôs hard to know in this wave of memecoins what‚Äôs for real and what‚Äôs dogshit, it‚Äôs hard to find an easier set of signals than what‚Äôs being presented with Saturna. With an **audit, listings, and major influencer campaigns** coming soon, this baby has barely begun to breathe. **10k holders is basically an inevitability at this trajectory,** which should easily stabilize this price point to an 8-figure mark. 

Listen to me, don‚Äôt, these things have a life of their own so the only thing up to you is whether you want to be a part of it. I‚Äôd check out the website first though, see the energy with the community, and **ask yourself what you‚Äôll think if you see this at 100x next month.**

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,BTC: the financial revolution is here. ,"BTC: the financial revolution is here. 

Many were skeptical of this digital currency but now it's starting to gain momentum. 

BTC community: the only larping memecoin!

Back in 2009  you heard of ""the bitcoin"" but decided to brush it off because ""digital money"" was just a fad. Well, life rarely gives you a second chance but this is crypto and BTC community might be the opportunity that you didn't have 15 years ago! Also, this project is a time machine. Join our community and reminisce with us about 2009! 

BTC community was born on Pumpfun, which speaks volumes about the community that backs it because very few pumpfun projects actually get to Raydium. I know, there are many BTC copycats out there but this is the first BTC coin on SOL that is backed by decent folks and want to build something worthwhile. We've been growing organically for weeks and I'm sure we'll reach millions at some point because our community is truly amazing and hardworking. 

You fade BTC in 2009; don't fade BTC community in 2024. 

As always, DYOR!

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,"BTC Bull - Launched a few hours ago at 380$ MC and the floor is set at 6k with 102 holders, great team and community, devs had previous projects, they're based and safe | Receive 10% btc rewards for holding |","Brought to you by 2 experienced developers, TheMakkk (Max) and LDLD.

Written with a clean quality solidity code.

So LDLD is a developer who already launched 1 token 3 weeks ago, his first token name was ApeCoinBSC, it was a low MC token too, it went from 350$ MC to 8200$ MC, which is not bad at all for his first one, you know how BSC is.

Max launched 3 tokens, this will be the 4th, you can find all the info in his announcements channel: [https://t.me/MakkksAnnouncements](https://t.me/MakkksAnnouncements)

This one is promising to have more attention, first of all because of the BTC rewards and Low MC, people getting in at that low MC will be able to become whales with full max wallet which will be 3%.

Why BTC? Because BTC broke All Time High (ATH) ! This means a new bullish trend is starting around bitcoin, that's why they chose the name BTC Bull.

**Basic information about BTC Bull:**

* \- Total supply: 100,000,000,000
* \- Max Transaction (Buy/Sell) - 1% - 1,000,000,000 Tokens
* \- Max Wallet - 3% - 3,000,000,000 Tokens

**Token Economics:**

* \- 10% Bitcoin rewards - just hold the BTC Bull token and receive BTC in your wallet.
* \- 5% Auto Liquidity - to ensure a stable chart.
* \- 5% Marketing - at some point the marketing has to hit to develop the project.

Anyway this could become a juicy GEM with a big potential of hitting 100x and more because the Market Cap will be low, devs are trusted and the rewards are insane!

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,"BTC Bull - 3 days old, from 380$ mc to 140k $, now dip at 70k $, | Working on the roadmap to update the website to v2 | 10% BTC Rewards | 2 experienced devs with nice previous projects |","Brought to you by 2 experienced developers, TheMakkk (Max) and LDLD.

Written with a clean quality solidity code.

So LDLD is a developer who already launched 1 token 3 weeks ago, his first token name was ApeCoinBSC, it was a low MC token too, it went from 350$ MC to 8200$ MC, which is not bad at all for his first one, you know how BSC is.

Max launched 3 tokens, this will be the 4th, you can find all the info in his announcements channel: [https://t.me/MakkksAnnouncements](https://t.me/MakkksAnnouncements)

This one is promising to have more attention, first of all because of the BTC rewards and Low MC, people getting in at that low MC will be able to become whales with full max wallet which will be 3%.

Why BTC? Because BTC broke All Time High (ATH) ! This means a new bullish trend is starting around bitcoin, that's why they chose the name BTC Bull.

**Basic information about BTC Bull:**

* \- Total supply: 100,000,000,000
* \- Max Transaction (Buy/Sell) - 1% - 1,000,000,000 Tokens
* \- Max Wallet - 3% - 3,000,000,000 Tokens

**Token Economics:**

* \- 10% Bitcoin rewards - just hold the BTC Bull token and receive BTC in your wallet.
* \- 5% Auto Liquidity - to ensure a stable chart.
* \- 5% Marketing - at some point the marketing has to hit to develop the project.

Anyway this could become a juicy GEM with a big potential of hitting 100x and more because the Market Cap will be low, devs are trusted and the rewards are insane!

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,$BTC - Solana‚Äôs first LARP driven memecoin with 1000x potential - transporting you back to 2009 and the genesis of Bitcoin,"Bitcoin ($BTC) is the first LARP driven memecoin on the Soland blockchain, transporting you back to Satoshi's 2009 inner circle, giving you another chance to become an early adopter and buy some pizza for bitcoins.

Join the TG to find out how you can help build this new peer-to-peer cash system, and relive real world events around the time of Bitcoin's genesis.

Bitcoin ($BTC) made it out of the pump.fun trenches organically and has an active and passionate community and team. The current market cap is only $22k, which means huge upside potential. At today‚Äôs prices 1 SOL = over 6 million bitcoins! You could be set for life.

Project Abstract:

A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer cash network, with ""blocks"" of transactions recorded on an infinite chain, kind of like Lego¬Æ!

Imagine you and your friends are building a tower with Legos, and you all have to agree on the exact same way to add new pieces to the tower. Every time someone wants to add a Lego, they show it to everyone, and if it fits the rules, it gets added. Bitcoin works like that! The Legos are like tiny pieces of digital money, and everyone in the world can see the tower, so no one can cheat by adding fake pieces. This way, everyone trusts the tower because it's built step-by-step, with everyone agreeing on each piece!

Join the community and help build this Lego tower:

Our presale is close to hitting the softcap! Developers will be in voice chat until it ends in 4 hours.

Utilities:

‚úîÔ∏èDaily Burns: We have allocated 7.5% of the supply to be manually burnt every single day. This means our price will slowly increase daily.

‚úîÔ∏èDaily Lottery: We have allocated 7.5% of the supply to be given away every day in small amounts. We will also be giving away BTCB throughout this time.

‚úîÔ∏èHigh tax + low tax periods: During special events, we will raise the tax or lower the tax depending on the situation. This includes low volume periods, high volume periods, launch, and massive promotions.

‚úîÔ∏èSell cooldowns: We have implemented a buy and sell cooldown in our contract. This will stop holders from repeatedly selling their tokens. Imagine a high tax period with a high sell cooldown.

‚úîÔ∏èBuyback: 3% of every transaction is stored to be used during dips, low volume periods to buy back KishuBTC.

‚úîÔ∏èBTC Rewards: If you hold KishuBTC, you will automatically earn 6% BTC rewards. All you need to do is add the BTCB address to your wallet.

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,I think I found the $OHM of this cycle at $10M mc - Blackrock Fund $BTC,"Blackrock Fund aims to become a state of the art hedge-fund with ohm mechanics such as staking and bonds. However, Ohm a major inflation problem that ultimately diluted holders. BTC aims to correct that issue with a unique debase and staking mechanism. Thread below is pretty good on the mechanics of it:

[https://twitter.com/CryptoSausage/status/1749155457145425925](https://twitter.com/CryptoSausage/status/1749155457145425925) 

And here‚Äôs a thread on upcoming features. 

[https://twitter.com/CryptoSausage/status/1750062754902241621](https://twitter.com/CryptoSausage/status/1750062754902241621) 

So far, the project has led to an impressive 91% staked, $1.5M burned, and accumulated a nearly $4M treasury. 

As you guys saw, $PEAS just released their v2 and they are doing extremely well at >$100m market cap. BTC‚Äôs upcoming feature takes on what makes them a success - volatility farming- and make it better by combining it with debase and incentivized Uniswap V3 pools, which is far more efficient. Additionally, the genius part of this is that BTC is continuously debasing, meaning arbitrage opportunities are infinite ‚Äì which leads to greater fees for the protocol. 

Upcoming catalysts include launching non native volatility farming pools, boostraping tvl and arbitrage fees with incentives through Smardex and Angle, a possible launchpad, cross-chain expansions, CEX listings, and phase 2 & 3 of protocol which include ETH and USDC emissions.

Eventually the token will become deflationary. With a 1M max supply (and over 60k tokens burned already), the mechanics are there to create continuous supply pressure, which swill create a situation where BTC is actually hard to come by. Only 20k or so tokens available right now to purchase given the high staking %.

I think this has all the tools necessary to become a defi darling in 2024/2025. Currently around a 10M marketcap.",17,2024-02-19 19:22:58,18

In our opinion, the recovery of bitcoin is imminent.  We have decided to create this Coin in which we will give up the owner.  We creators will not have wallets.  We will purchase as the whole community will do in the hope that it will be the first Coin without dev that can move forward thanks to the help of the community.  We have prepared the site, the telegram group and we will not fail with continuous updates on the site and in the group.  But we want to remind you that we will be investors just like you.  So the help of anyone who has the opportunity is welcome.  Sharing is the best marketing weapon.

$BOMB is an algocoin which is designed to follow the price of BTC. Enjoy high yields normally only found on high risk assets, but with exposure to BTC instead!

üåê Website: [https://app.bomb.money/](https://app.bomb.money/)

üí¨ Telegram: [https://t.me/bombmoneybsc](https://t.me/bombmoneybsc)

üí¨ Twitter: [https://twitter.com/BombMoneyBSC](https://twitter.com/BombMoneyBSC)

üí¨ Discord: [https://discord.gg/rbpXTnHJ](https://discord.gg/rbpXTnHJ)

The $BOMB algorithmic token serves as the backbone of a rapidly growing ecosystem aimed towards bringing liquidity and new use cases to the BSC network.

The protocol's underlying mechanism dynamically adjusts $BOMB's supply, pushing its price up or down relative to the price of $BTC.

Inspired by [tomb.finance](https://tomb.finance/), which was originally inspired by the idea behind Basis as well as its predecessors (bDollar and soup), [bomb.money](https://bomb.money/) is a multi-token protocol which consists of the following three tokens:

üí£ bomb.money ($BOMB)

üí£ BOMB Shares ($BSHARE)

üí£ BOMB Bonds ($BBOND)

**What differentiates $BOMB from other algorithmic tokens?**

Unlike previous algorithmic tokens, $BOMB is not pegged to a stable coin ‚Äî it is instead pegged to $BTC.

Because of BTCs high per coin price, we have decided to peg BOMB to BTC at a 10,000:1 ratio. In other words, 10,000 BOMB should equal 1 BTC for our PEG to be maintained.

One of the primary shortcomings of past algorithmic tokens has been a lack of use cases, leaving no good reason for somebody to want to use or hold them. In order to successfully maintain the peg in the long-run, the BOMB team will maintain a focus on innovation around enhanced functionality and use cases.

Here's a great explanation:

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,$7DAY [$200k market cap] 7 Days Passed Proven Anti Dump During BTC Drop and Still Rising. $20M Potential,"**More than 7 days have passed.**

This coin has absolutely crazy moon potential.

It's a community-owned token. Rug-pull proof **(ownership-renounced, liquidity burned)**.

It's breaking a new ATH every single day.

The only proven anti dump tokenomics along with a 7 day locking period that actually works (look at the chart, even when bitcoin took a nosedive 7DAY still went up).

It's still super early, and has potential to go up to $1M market cap by **TOMORROW. It's only 200k right now, this is easily 100X potential.**

Dips are non existent even when the market had a huge downturn.

I sleep well at night knowing the token won't dump by the time I wake up like some of these other risky investments.

\-

Tokenomics:

7 day locking period initiated on every transfer

11% tax on transactions for normal buys and sells

55% tax on early transactions who don't wait the full 7 days

50% holdings weekly sell cap

Wallets with more than 1% of the supply are capped at 0.5% weekly sells

\-  
100% of the liquidity posted was locked with team finance, renounced ownership and a 30% initial burn for a compounding burn function.

Tokenized Mining Power!

&#x200B;

What is EDAC?

EDAC is the tokenization of mining power. Token holders can contribute to the process of securing PoW blockchain networks while benefiting from block rewards directly with EDAC. The token is independent of the blockchain.

How does it work?

The process is as follows: EDAC tokens are sold and used to buy hashrate power, i.e. through rigs. This power generates mining rewards. The net proceeds (approximately 50% of all ETH rewards) are used to buy EDAC coins, which will be burned immediately. This steady demand and dwindling supply should drive the price of EDAC to new all-time highs.

When an ATH is reached (not before), up to 0.5% of the token supply can be sold to buy new mining capacity, forming a virtuous circle of returns.

For Edac, this is just the beginning, you may wonder why?

EDAC is formed by a great team where each one of them is specialized in different areas, it is clear that we have the most qualified team in this field.

We have accomplished so much and I'm super proud of this family and community for being active and willing to help the team row in the same direction at the same time.  This is how we all win!  I know some of you may be growing impatient as we have been trending sideways.  Remember, whenever you are feeling this way, put the chart to the hourly chart and ZOOM OUT.

We have been maintaining \~ 2.4 mil MC which is roughly about 5x from the IDO listing price!  Most projects would have had a massive correction back towards the initial presale price, but our holders are standing their ground, staking their pets, and earning massive $PETS rewards! üëè

Remind yourself that this is a SERIOUS project with AMAZING potential!  Projects like this take some time to really develop and take off.  Those who are early (all of you here now) will be rewarded if you're smart and HODL with those diamond hands! üíéü§≤

**Note:**

Bitcoin has surpassed its ALL TIME HIGH of $64,976 and is in price discovery now!  The bull run is about to hit it's final leg up and BTC is going to run HARD, then the alts will follow suit.  This is going to be a FUN couple of months before the BTC halving at the end of the year.  REMEMBER, do NOT get FOMO and ape into these massive pumps you'll be seeing in the big market, be patient, increase your buying power, and wait for the bear market to accumulate!

üëá Now, let's get into what we are looking forward to this week! üëá

¬ª Just an hour ago or so we got a pinned post in Travladd's Serious Investor Group!  Travladd runs an awesome AMA & gem hunting group and there are some deep pockets in there!

¬ª Next week on Oct. 26th at 7pm UTC we will be having an AMA in Travladd's group as well!  Let's make sure we all show our support by showing up to that, mark your calendars!

¬ª PooCoin Ads campaign resumes and continue to draw new curious BSC investors to $PETS

¬ª We have hired a top notch copywriter to draft articles for the following platforms:

   üëâ  Yahoo Finance, Yahoo News, AP News, Morningstar, MarketWatch, Benzinga, & Street Insider

¬ª Several high-quality YouTube project reviewers are producing videos for us to showcase the aesthetic MicroPETS DApp & all the adorable artwork & media we have to share with the world!

BTC,CryptoMoonShots,BTC Bull - Brought to you by 2 experienced developers | from 380$ to 40000$ (More than 100x) | Hidden GEM,"Brought to you by 2 experienced developers, TheMakkk (Max) and LDLD.

Written with a clean quality solidity code.

So LDLD is a developer who already launched 1 token 3 weeks ago, his first token name was ApeCoinBSC, it was a low MC token too, it went from 350$ MC to 8200$ MC, which is not bad at all for his first one, you know how BSC is.

Max launched 3 tokens, this will be the 4th, you can find all the info in his announcements channel: [https://t.me/MakkksAnnouncements](https://t.me/MakkksAnnouncements)

This one is promising to have more attention, first of all because of the BTC rewards and Low MC, people getting in at that low MC will be able to become whales with full max wallet which will be 3%.

Why BTC? Because BTC broke All Time High (ATH) ! This means a new bullish trend is starting around bitcoin, that's why they chose the name BTC Bull.

**Basic information about BTC Bull:**

* \- Total supply: 100,000,000,000
* \- Max Transaction (Buy/Sell) - 1% - 1,000,000,000 Tokens
* \- Max Wallet - 3% - 3,000,000,000 Tokens

**Token Economics:**

* \- 10% Bitcoin rewards - just hold the BTC Bull token and receive BTC in your wallet.
* \- 5% Auto Liquidity - to ensure a stable chart.
* \- 5% Marketing - at some point the marketing has to hit to develop the project.

Anyway this could become a juicy GEM with a big potential of hitting 100x and more because the Market Cap will be low, devs are trusted and the rewards are insane!

In 2023 following the November 30, 2022, debut of ChatGPT by San Francisco-based OpenAI. AI is poised to bring forth several revolutionary advancements in the cryptocurrency space. Nevertheless, despite the widespread use of AI projects, there is no monetization of related operations.

As a result, after years of working for companies like Coinbase, Oracle, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Symbiont, and Disney, a group of experts got together to create RaiinMaker. This will be the main driver behind the AI, Web3, and DePIN nodes toward a future where technology and practicality meet and users of the app can monetize their activities without excluding cryptocurrency.

RaiinMaker provides a futuristic look at the enormous potential of AI in the Web3 and cryptocurrency sectors to revolutionize the way people use these technologies and speed up cryptocurrency transactions. The majority of Web3, DePIN node, AI, and cryptocurrency aficionados joined the RaiinMaker validator testnet airdrop for this reason [https://www.raiinmaker.com/airdrop](https://www.raiinmaker.com/airdrop).

&#x200B;

The innovative Web3 and AI technology company Raiinmaker is the creator of the Raiinmaker Mobile Application and Raiinmaker Network. The new Web3 and decentralized AI platform, the Raiinmaker App, revolutionized the marketing of user contributions to AI infrastructure. By combining scalable Web3 and AI infrastructure, the Raiinmaker Network redefines value production concerning digital identity, conduct, and reputation. Because of the strength of the Raiinmaker Network, the native Protocol Web3 features of the Raiinmaker AI Super App are incorporated with ease. Among these are identity, token creation, NFT minting, and AI-powered smart contracts. In essence, Raiinmaker is supporting a novel idea: transforming consumers from doers into actual value creators in the digital space.

To facilitate the widespread adoption of Web3 and decentralized AI, Raiinmaker and BASE are dedicated to developing technology and products that place a high priority on flawless user experience and frictionless onboarding. ¬†

As of right now, Raiinmaker's Validator Testnet AirDrop on the DePIN is coming to an end.¬†¬†

BTC,Altcoin,How can a community coin like BitcoinZ perform?," So  I would open up discussion on BitcoinZ which is not in the top 100 on  CMC and still has potential. Since it is a crypto coin and driven by the community you can see that, it is not on many exchanges. I think it would improve a lot if it would be listed on some reputable exchanges.  this is one of the problems of this coin.

I  would say that the second problem would be funded, which are none since the coin is community-driven. There was no ICO sale or premine of this coin, fair start an anonymous developer caused that there are no funds been generated by ICO sale or premine...

Awareness is low, potentially this would mean that when awareness will rise  BitcoinZ could moon like crazy MF  :smile: with its current low price bags can be filled, and could potentially earn you a lot.  so would suggest you check the website and buy it, in my opinion.

With the current DIP of BTC also BitcoinZ was dragged down. So yeah many people will buy it now at this cheap price.

Right now as I follow discussions on Discord I can see that the community is  organizing to be listed on one of the exchanges, not sure on which, but rumors are to be listed on [Gate.io](https://gate.io/), so this would also moonshot this coin. since [Gate.io](https://gate.io/)  has many trading pairs and a big trading volume. So possibly if the  community gets coin-listed there a lot more investors could join.

there was some break with all events on the website but as I noticed, the website was being migrated, and that caused some spouse of events. I  guess that now more events will follow. If you wanna find out more about this coin go on [getbtcz.com](https://getbtcz.com/) and read more about it.

if we check all this market with wrapped coins and tokens we could say that BitcoinZ would also need some wrapping, which would offer BitcoinZ new exchanges and bigger volume. The community is also working on this,  they are offering some bounties for wrapping BitcoinZ, so developers could get some bounties probably, so could be a good idea to join the discord and ask if you wish to help.

But attention, like I mentioned BitcoinZ has no funds so do not expect that you could get a fortune for some work there, most work is voluntary, so rewards can be big or small, and most of the bounties are in BitcoinZ.

Would love to hear others' opinions positive or negative. And then I would try to forward it to the community, I see that the community rewards a lot  of stuff on Discord so any information could make some BTCZ.

BTC,Altcoin,Has Anyone Else Noticed Velar's Move to Revolutionize DeFi with a Perpetual DEX on Bitcoin?,"Hey everyone, I've been closely following the evolution of DeFi platforms and stumbled upon something pretty exciting‚ÄîVelar is on its way to launching the world's first perpetual DEX built on Bitcoin. This could be a game-changer, right?  
The idea of a perpetual DEX isn't just new; it's revolutionary. Think about it: combining the security and robustness of Bitcoin with the endless possibilities of DeFi. Velar is aiming to bridge these two worlds, potentially opening up a whole new realm of trading strategies and opportunities that were previously confined to traditional finance or not possible due to the limitations of existing blockchain infrastructures.  
What intrigues me the most is how they plan to tackle the common DeFi issues like liquidity and security. Plus, operating on Bitcoin could bring a level of stability and trust that's hard to find in the current Ethereum-dominated DeFi space. But I have questions‚Äîhow will they ensure deep liquidity? What mechanisms are in place to protect users against the inherent volatility?  
Would love to hear your thoughts on this. Could Velar's approach to perpetual DEXs on Bitcoin be the breakthrough we've been waiting for in DeFi?

BTC,Altcoin,Proof of stake explained: Why is it better than Bitcoin‚Äôs PoW?,"As the popularity of cryptocurrency continues to grow, it‚Äôs important to consider the environmental impact of these digital currencies.

One of the most well-known cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, uses a system called Proof of Work (PoW), which requires miners to solve complex mathematical equations to publish new blocks. This process consumes a significant amount of electricity, contributing to the carbon footprint of the currency.

However, there is hope for a more sustainable future for cryptocurrency. Proof of Stake (PoS) is a newer system that requires users to hold a certain amount of cryptocurrency to validate transactions. This reduces the system‚Äôs energy consumption and makes it a more environmentally friendly choice.

A Tale of Two Systems: PoW vs. PoS

Imagine a vast gold mine where hundreds of miners tirelessly dig, not knowing if they‚Äôll find gold or not.

This is the world of Proof of Work ‚Äî a competitive frenzy where participants, or miners, solve complex mathematical problems to publish a new block containing the latest record transactions

The first to solve the problem wins the block reward and publishes the new block, but the combined energy of all those participants, most of whom leave empty-handed, is immense.

Now, multiply that image by thousands ‚Äî representing all the miners worldwide ‚Äî and you can visualize the scale of energy consumption.

On October 31, 2008, a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto sent a nine-page whitepaper to a group of cryptographers for a digital currency named bitcoin. On 9 January 2009, It was born from the ideals, and the first block was launched on the bitcoin network. To this day, the creator remains one of the world's greatest mysteries in the blockchain world.

&#x200B;

Bitcoin was created to move away from relying on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. Being decentralized, Bitcoin can be free from any control of government bodies and banks and can facilitate peer-to-peer technology. All transactions have to go through a verification process through the whole network and can be found on the digital ledger known as the blockchain. Bitcoin is not physical and popularised the Proof-of-Work system, which is still being widely used in other forks of bitcoin. Bitcoin itself is divisible to eight decimal places, and one hundred millionth of a bitcoin is commonly known as one satoshis 0.00000001)...

Positive Reviews

Most people in crypto possibly already know that building a good name in the crypto exchange industry is not the easier thing.

Many  clients don‚Äôt understand how to use their crypto assets. Or there are  fraudulent people who write negative reviews in order to advertise  ‚Äúspecialized services in recovering funds‚Äù etc and all these result in  many negative reviews even for popular exchanges like Binance or Kucoin.

Despite  this fact, WhiteBIT makes it to be among the top performers in the most  reviewing platforms like TrustPilot or CryptocurrencyExchanges. At the  same time, it enjoys top-rated reviews for its apple or android apps.  These complete the image of a reputable exchange that can really partner  with a pure cryptocurrency project like BITCOINZ and help it jump to  the next level.

What about BITCOINZ ? Why it has this impressive uptrend for weeks even during a general cryptocurrency bear market ?

There are four main reasons behind this move.

\- BITCOINZ had three listings in 2022: In TradeOgre, Exbitron and now in WhiteBIT exchange.

\-The  Project presented a new Dynamic Roadmap on 22-January-2022 in the  Z-Brain Meeting of the BITCOINZ Community. The new Roadmap can be found  in the main page of the Project.

\-  BITCOINZ is in a development frenzy recently with new developers  joining its Community and many nice advancements in the Project's  ecosystem like the BITCOINZ-DEX , the Army-Z , the Connect-Z and more.

\-  Most importantly, BITCOINZ is a pure cryptocurrency network that  follows all the fundamentals that the classic Bitcoin introduced for  years, with many extra advantages.

How BITCOINZ differs from the classic Bitcoin without breaking the classic fundamentals ?

BITCOINZ  (BTCZ) was launched in 2017 and is a pure cryptocurrency that offers  solutions to all the five ‚Äúflaws‚Äù of the legendary Bitcoin :

1. Its scalability offered higher transaction speed and more transactions per second
2. BITCOINZ‚Äôs high maximum supply is the ideal for easier prices without long non integer numbers.
3. The  21B coin supply, in combination with the much more transactions per  second, guarantees super low, next to zero fees even if it had the BTC  cap and network load. BitcoinZ is ideal for transferring even very small  sums of under $10 with \~0% cost.
4. BITCOINZ‚Äôs  ASIC resistant Zhash algorithm protects the PC miners from the ASIC  elites. This way it achieves a Decentralized Network with truly fair  distribution of coins to the world Community. Not to the rich people  owning an ASIC device.
5. BITCOINZ features private transactions, offering true privacy for everyone.
6. (extra)  BITCOINZ is a green Proof of Work Network since a) it utilizes a much  more energy efficient algo than BTC b) the users can use their PCs for  other activities while mining BTCZ because only the GPU is (mildly) used  for the process and c) it supports more transactions per second with  plenty of space for future upgrades.

At the same time, BITCOINZ fulfils all the fundamentals of a pure cryptocurrency :

1. It was founded by anonymous founders, and it is a 100% Community Driven project, with no central authority issuing coins.
2. 100%  of its coin supply is distributed to its network‚Äôs supporters (miners)  with the Proof of Work model. Everyone if free to join it with the  mining procedure using just a PC.
3. It  had the fairest launch ever with absolutely no premine, no initial coin  offerings and no instamine period (something that is questionable even  for Bitcoin).
4. It  is an asset that acts as a hedge against inflation because it has a  fixed maximum supply and reduced coin emission over time with fair and  slow mining halving plan, every 4 years.

Why BITCOINZ uses the ""BITCOIN"" name and why it is really different from the so many projects that used it.

BITCOINZ  used the ""BITCOIN"" name adding a Z because it honoured and followed all  the aforementioned fundamentals that the classic BITCOIN introduced  (fair rules, 100% Community Driven, 100% Decentralized, 100% Proof of  Work) and at the same time it offed Zero fees, only PC-mining with its  Zhash algorithm and optional privacy based on the Zk-snarks  cryptography. So there was no better name to describe all these than  ""BITCOIN+Z"".

It  is worth mentioning that BITCOINZ is the oldest and maybe the only  ""BITCOIN"" named project that can still be mined with a normal PC, and it  is not a Bitcoin blockchain fork since it had its own genesis block.

Other  crypto projects that have used the ""Bitcoin"" name, did it afterwards,  in a misleading way, or they are just copies of the BITCOIN's blockchain  (blockchain-forks) that have given free coins (forkdrops) to the  Bitcoin holders. In such a way, these ""BITCOIN"" named projects try to  enjoy a high free exposure by distributing coins to the BITCOIN owners.  Sometimes bad actors from the BITCOIN chain-fork projects even steal the  private keys from the BTC owners that try to claim their free coins in  the BTC-forks.

In  contrast, BITCOINZ had its own unique blockchain exactly like Bitcoin  did and never made any forkdrops. Offering equal opportunities to  everyone by distributing the 100% of its supply to the whole world  Community and not to a closed team. Exactly like a real cryptocurrency  should be destined to do, being a gift of Freedom and Equality.

A Conclusion for the cryptocurrency moves of the last month

As a conclusion, the moves that we saw during the last month are a trend and not a random event.

The  biggest victims of this new downtrend are the very overvalued  cryptocurrencies and the DeFi projects, especially their tokens because  of the hyper-inflation and the many useless meme/scam projects .

BITCOINZ,  being among the most classic, pure mineable projects with many  advantages over Bitcoin, fixed supply and the most fair rules ever,  makes it to surprise everyone acting as a hedge against inflation,  questionable crypto and scam tokens.

Monero hard fork makes hackers' favorite coin even more private XMR,"On 12 August 2022 the number of transactions in [Monero](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/) network reaches 25% of transactions in Bitcoin network. Monero hard fork makes hackers' favorite coin even more private.

Monero's latest network update further boosts transaction source and privacy on an already uncracked system, making it a real challenge for deciphering efforts.

Monero beats Bitcoin on privacy, fungibility, transaction fees, and mining algorithm. Bitcoin beats Monero when it comes to transaction speed, scalability, network effect, supply, and price. Therefore, it's hard to pick a clear winner when comparing these two crypto assets.

After the update on August 13, the number of users has increased significantly, which indicates a great potential for growth and trust in the anonymity of the coin.

Rising during green market and holding during big market drops. And this is exactly what separates good coins like $HEGE from shitcoins that will sooner or later end up being rugged.

But this is not what I want to talk about today.

I want to talk about the generosity of $HEGE community and about the competitions they are holding every once in a while. And I am not talking about small prizes there. Every competition has 1k+ in prize-pool usually divided between 3-6 people.

And I think that $250 for making a simple Reddit posts or Tiktok videos is definitely worth it.

So first, let me tell you about my experience with $HEGE.

I first found $HEGE when it was at 700k market cap. I bought it here and sold for 2x without even joining the TG. But then I saw it absolutely flew and had to join. In only 1 month I won around 150k $HEGE tokens from competitions. That is around $4,5k at ATH and I never sold a single token.

And now you have a chance to win a giveaway too. The community is sending thousands of dollars to people making Reddit posts. The more you work, the more money you get. Simple as that.

And because the community is working hard every day, $HEGE is already listed on 4 exchanges and even appeared on Binance AMA, it is a no brainer here at 8mil market cap. I said it 2 months ago and I will say it again.

$HEGE will reach 100mil+ this bullrun!

So join our Telegram and take part in one of the comps to win a bag of $HEGE. And who knows, maybe you will end up making a lot of money.

&#x200B;

How BITCOINZ differs from the classic Bitcoin without breaking the classic fundamentals ?

&#x200B;

BITCOINZ (BTCZ) was launched in 2017 and is a pure cryptocurrency that offers solutions to all the five ‚Äúflaws‚Äù of the legendary Bitcoin :

1) Its scalability offered higher transaction speed and more transactions per second

2) BITCOINZ‚Äôs high maximum supply is the ideal for easier prices without long non integer numbers.

3) The 21B coin supply, in combination with the much more transactions per second, guarantees super low, next to zero fees even if it had the BTC cap and network load. BitcoinZ is ideal for transferring even very small sums of under $10 with \~0% cost.

5) BITCOINZ features private transactions, offering true privacy for everyone.

&#x200B;

At the same time, BITCOINZ fulfils all the fundamentals of a pure cryptocurrency :

2) 100% of its coin supply is distributed to its network‚Äôs supporters (miners) with the Proof of Work model. Everyone if free to join it with the mining procedure using just a PC.

3) It had the fairest launch ever with absolutely no premine, no initial coin offerings and no instamine period (something that is questionable even for Bitcoin).

4) It is an asset that acts as a hedge against inflation because it has a fixed maximum supply and reduced coin emission over time with fair and slow mining halving plan, every 4 years.

&#x200B;

Why BITCOINZ uses the ""BITCOIN"" name and why it is really different from the so many projects that used it.

&#x200B;

BITCOINZ used the ""BITCOIN"" name adding a Z because it honoured and followed all the aforementioned fundamentals that the classic BITCOIN introduced (fair rules, 100% Community Driven, 100% Decentralized, 100% Proof of Work) and at the same time it offed Zero fees, only PC-mining with its Zhash algorithm and optional privacy based on the Zk-snarks cryptography. So there was no better name to describe all these than ""BITCOIN+Z"".

&#x200B;

It is worth mentioning that BITCOINZ is the oldest and maybe the only ""BITCOIN"" named project that can still be mined with a normal PC, and it is not a Bitcoin blockchain fork since it had its own genesis block.

Exactly like a real cryptocurrency should be destined to do, being a gift of Freedom and Equality.

&#x200B;

A Conclusion for the cryptocurrency moves of the last month

&#x200B;

As a conclusion, the moves that we saw during the last month are a trend and not a random event.

The biggest victims of this new downtrend are the very overvalued cryptocurrencies and the DeFi projects, especially their tokens because of the hyper-inflation and the many useless meme/scam projects.

BITCOINZ, being among the most classic, pure mineable projects with many advantages over Bitcoin, fixed supply and the most fair rules ever, makes it to surprise everyone acting as a hedge against inflation, questionable crypto and scam tokens.

BTC,Altcoin,Huge opportunity for short squeeze of Bitcoin SV after this court case,"So there‚Äôs a court case happening right now for Billions of dollars in Bitcoin, and the way its going its likely that evidence could come out that will reveal information about Satoshi Nakamoto. Its being covered by major news publications like¬†[Fortune](https://fortune.com/2021/11/02/bitcoin-trial-satoshi-nakamoto-craig-wright-david-kleiman-wallet/?utm_campaign=fortunemagazine&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&xid=soc_socialflow_twitter_FORTUNE),¬†[Wallstreet Journal](https://archive.md/NRbwx),¬†[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-01/mystery-of-who-invented-bitcoin-hangs-over-scientist-s-trial),¬†[CoinmarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/legal-fight-over-1-1-million-bitcoin-begins), and the¬†[Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/bitcoin-trial-court-cryptocurrency-invented-b1949430.html). Here‚Äôs what I have to say about a short squeeze

The case in brief:¬†

A court in Florida is hearing a trial for possession of Bitcoin worth suspected roughly $70B. Ira Kleiman, the plaintiff, is defending the estate of his brother David Kleiman. David was a colleague of the defendant, Craig Wright, and suspected to work on a project he claims to be the Bitcoin whitepaper.¬†**Both parties in the case are constructing their arguments under the pretense that Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto.** 

The plaintiffs are alleging that Wright stole Bitcoins and IP from his deceased partner Dave. The defendant is alleging that there was no formal partnership, and that Dave was simply a friend who helped at times but was not a partner in the creation of Bitcoin.¬†

Short/Gamma Squeeze:¬†

The suit is going on now, and new evidence surrounding Bitcoin‚Äôs creation is surfacing each day. Craig Wright is surrounded with mixed evidence regarding his satoshi-ness, with the biggest issue that he‚Äôs never signed with Satoshi‚Äôs keys publicly ([although did sign privately](http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi), and his¬†[close associate Calvin Ayre tweeted that Craig Wright would provide Satoshi keys after the trial](https://twitter.com/CalvinAyre/status/1459567429076533254?s=20)).

The discover process for Kleiman v Wright has dug up a myriad of documents relating to Craig Wright and his involvement with the development of the original Bitcoin :

* Testimony from various witnesses (testifying on behalf of¬†[plaintiff](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6309656/590/16/kleiman-v-wright/)¬†and¬†[defendant](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6309656/590/3/kleiman-v-wright/)) who place Dr. Wright talking about and¬†**sending documents pertaining to Bitcoin before and shortly after its release**

It seems as though there‚Äôs a misconception among crypto whales as to the likleyhood this trial could move markets. The trail could have signifiant short term price impacts on Bitcoin SV, a version of Bitcoin that Wright is heavily associated with and endorses as ‚Äúthe real bitcoin‚Äù. CW is a controversial figure and understandably many are hesitant to endorse him as Bitcoin‚Äôs creator.

Bitcoin SV is often overlooked because of its association with Wright,¬†**making it one of the most shorted cryptos.**¬†The findings in this case could eclipse market sentiment ‚Äî there‚Äôs potential for both a short squeeze and a gamma squeeze.¬†

There‚Äôs big trading implications to this trial, I think more people should be talking about trading this case and the possible price movements of Bitcoin SV.",2,2021-11-16 16:23:43,7
BTC,Altcoin,What is BitcoinLatinum (LTNM) - Beginners guide," Bitcoin Latinum aims to pick up where Bitcoin‚Äôs idea of being a bankless and peer-to-peer electronic cash system left off. It is a next-generation Bitcoin fork capable of handling large transaction volumes, cybersecurity, and digital asset management. The idea is to solve the inherent problems of scalability and the transactions per second rate of its parent cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Latinum creates a decentralized financial network for efficient and secure digital asset transactions for media, gaming, cloud computing and telecommunications.

In addition, Bitcoin Latinum has taken a groundbreaking green initiative to achieve a carbon net-zero footprint by deploying a consensus protocol system. The intent is to introduce a new paradigm for cryptocurrency utility.

**Key Features:**

**Greener, energy efficient consensus:** Bitcoin Latinum takes a groundbreaking green initiative to achieve a net-zero carbon footprint by deploying a PoWer-friendly Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. It is in accordance with the project's commitment to sustainable environmental practices and support of the Crypto Climate Accord.

**Faster transactions:** This is achieved with a variety of mechanisms including the energy-efficient consensus protocol, approved node configuration, high performance node interconnection, the larger block size for the network and shorter confirmation.

**Secure and Insured:** Bitcoin Latinum nodes implement Workload Protection strategies to secure the network. Additionally, Bitcoin features a distributed transaction firewall to safeguard the network. Users are protected under a comprehensive insurance program that protects LTNM holders in case of internal collusion or external theft.

**Community Governed:** Bitcoin Latinum uses a representative government model to achieve true democracy in its ecosystem. It is done by allowing community members to participate in the governance mechanism of the protocol via staking model.

BTC,Altcoin,What does Tim Drapers $250K forecast of bitcoins price by 2022 tell us?,"Before you discount the prediction let‚Äôs see if we can detract some valuable insights from it. 

Because we know this prediction came from Tim Draper and given his extensive experience in the business of taking risks, let‚Äôs see if this prediction can offer us more insight.

\[1\] $250K forecast - That figure is directionally correct, meaning that it‚Äôs definitely going to be higher than what it is today. Whether or not it will hit $250K is besides the point, at least from the forecasters perspective.  The forecaster wants to encourage a discussion to take place for discussion sake. He wants BITCOIN and Crypto to be on top of peoples mind because the things we think about and remember best, seem more important to you than the other things.

\[2\] Tim Draper has a big chunk of bitcoin that he‚Äôs been accumulating for a while and it‚Äôs in his best interest for it to increase in value. We the people are all subject to this sort of behavior because it‚Äôs a self preservation sort of thing. 

\[3\] Tim‚Äôs forecast included a rationale for bitcoins rise. He believes that as the regulatory headwinds make way for institutional investors coming into the market via ETF‚Äôs, that move will serve as further validation and will in kind drive the value of Bitcoin up. 

\[4\] Tim‚Äôs been in the bitcoin space much longer than the 90&#37; of it‚Äôs current investors. Aside from this he is a venture capitalists and takes these sorts of big bets all the time. The VC model is predicated around long-shots and in order to justify these moves, TIm and his team have to mitigate the risks involved. 

\[5\] Lastly, prices moving in one direction tend to keep moving in that direction (at least until an equal force pushes it back in an opposite direction). This point is predicated around Newtons Law and in finance terms this is known as momentum trading and Draper is helping to build a trend.

In other words, security returns are determined by ex ante (based on forecasts) expectations of future cashflow, price and risk.

I wouldn‚Äôt discount this forecast at all because from a persuasive nature, it has a lot of validity, especially when it is applied to human psychology. Forecasts are one of the main factors that set trends.",10,2018-07-02 16:38:05,21

BTC,Altcoin,The NEW relationship between Bitcoin and Altcoins... Times are a'changing. THEORY. <3,"     It's my belief that the relationship between bitcoin and altcoins is beginning to shift a ton... i.e., up until very recently alts would correspond positively to a drop in bitcoin (go down as well), and even when bitcoin would go up by significant amount, alts may drop due to people reinvesting in bitcoin, as it preformed well. 

     It's my belief that this relationship is actually beginning to change, significantly, and there's seven (and probably more) reasons why: 1) Bitcoin is losing more and more market share to alt coins everyday @ a significant rate 2) Bitcoin's price has been recently falling and on a continuing basis 3) Bitcoin has significant problems (high fees and a slow network, also, it is nothing but a store of oversold value) 4) There's been a crazy amount of negative press towards Bitcoin, while there's been many positive articles about various altcoins/ ICO's with their promising new tech and all the crazy percentage increases that have significantly outperformed even bitcoin's high ROI, all last year (these new articles, all while bitcoin continues its' slide 5) in the last week or so, the alt coin market as a whole has been a better investment than bitcoin, i.e. out preformed, and people are beginning to pay attention to all these new tickers 6) now the biggest one, FOMO... as bitcoin slides from a very expensive and questionably high price, and as people get bombarded with these negative articles about BTC and its' future, more and more people are beginning to believe that that boat has already sailed, while all these alt coins, with much better tech and prices sometimes in the pennies, are preforming well (better than BTC)... 7) there's a large amount of people that have bought BTC in the last couple months, for the first time (as Bitcoin, aka crypto in general is the ""future""), and these new investors were planning on investing more than once, i.e. paycheck to paycheck, Christmas money, increased potential gain, 2018 investments, etc... because they're becoming more and more aware that a lot of people are still making money in other currencies, while they watch their first investment drop 30-40%, FOMO kicks in again, not to forget that these first time investors just experienced first hand, what they now see as BTC... something intangible that took 2 days or much more to arrive, while they are paying/ have payed sometimes 50-hundreds of dollars in fees (often paying more in fees than the cost of their btc) to buy/ send their BTC. 
 
     Now, all these second time buyers, even the 3rd and 4th time, as well those just starting are beginning to take their money and invest in alts, many possibly even selling their bitcoin at a significant loss (price is declining much)... especially, so they don't miss out on actually possibly making all the money they dreamed of, originally... and keep in mind all these new investors are just used to btc goin up, they weren't in it for the previous drops... They want easy quick money and bitcoin is proving to NOT be quite that... Thus, people are afraid they are missing out FOMOing on these often higher ROI's and possibly on betting on/ investing early on in the NEXT (remember all the negativity, flaws, and downward movement) bitcoin, the ""bitcoin 2.0"". This all leads me to believe, that the new relationship between bitcoin and alt coins is, now, almost inverse to its' previous relationship, when bitcoin declines, new money is now coming to the alt coin market... and, even, as bitcoin begins to slowly crawl back, this won't be enough for the dreams they had/ still have, remember now many (thanks to the media and articles like ""These 5 cryptocurrencies did way better than bitcoin last year""... or ""today""). While bitcoin slides, all the money that was originally earmarked for bitcoin, actually is starting to get invested into alt coins (take for example, the 150% increase in ripple, making ripple have a larger market cap than ethereum, even though it is/ was way overbought, has a ridiculously large number of outstanding coins (SO BIG), and it is not even clear if any bank at all is actually going to use the xrp token in the future, but, let's remember that ripple is an extremely popular investment for those new to crypto, BIG NAME, 3rd now 2nd largest, banks!, it's just $1-2! (...if it just went to half of bitcoin's price LOLOL, I'd be rich!, and it has been going up while bitcoin slides... So, here and increasingly so, we will see a disproportionate amount of new or existing BTC money be invested into alt coins, while bitcoin likely continues to lose billions in market cap. This is my new understanding/ theory... LOL, sorry for the rant, but I believe 2018 will be a good year for alts, blockchain, and crypto at large, but a bad year for Bitcoin. Who wants to bet how quickly this will get deleted from r/bitcoin, LOL.",4,2017-12-31 04:25:43,21

That network is Stacks ($STX). With stacks you can earn bitcoin by 'stacking' (locking up STX ) and write smart contracts to build applications that utilize the bitcoin computing network. The mining hashes in Bitcoin confirm transactions for Stacks, using Bitcoin as the security layer. This makes Bitcoin programmable and scalable fueling smart contracts with stacks.

BITCOINZ IS BITCOIN 2.0

\- Bitcoin technology

\- Anonymous transactions (zk-SNARKs privacy)

\- Bitcoin has all transactions publicly available.

\- decentralized GPU mining (ASIC miners are banned, hardforks to prevent ASIC miners are allowed)

\- Decentralized development / All contributors are volunteers

\- Big blocks -> blocks are similar to BCH

The goal is to port all best free software on the market to be able to use in BitcoinZ.

Immutable params:

\- Mineable ‚õèÔ∏è

\- Max supply

\- Inflation

\- Only POW algo - we may change Zhash algo to other POW algo to prevent ASIC miners

\- New features are allowed to improve usage / scalability, but we will never change history (ETH/ETC case)

Algo: Zhash (always GPU mining - we promote decentralization in mining)

Max supply 21B coins

Current supply: 12,500 coins every 2.5 minutes

Current block size is similar to BCH (BTCZ = 2MB every 2.5 mins \~ BCH = 8MB every 10 min)

I am not affiliated with Btcz, but the team really does make you feel like family. Every decision they make is ran through us first and no decision is agreed on without the whole community backing it.

I personally have never felt so connected to a coin, this is what crypto SHOULD be. 100% decentralized and not ran by some billion dollar company looking out for themselves. If dogecoin can be worth 40 cents without any real case uses, imagine what BTCZ could reach.

BTC,Altcoin,Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance has declined. Why is it important to monitor this indicator?,"The first cryptocurrency is losing influence on altcoins. Experts explained why this is happening and what it could mean for the market.  


https://preview.redd.it/3sgmwz2d7jr61.jpg?width=6333&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eabed3ac54ebaee2393532aaf2ab9b1870212a71

Yesterday, April 5, the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market for the first time crossed the mark of $2 trillion. Over the past 24 hours, the capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has increased by 4% and now stands at $2.03 trillion. According to CoinGecko, Bitcoin is on the first place in the rating of most capitalized cryptocurrencies with the index of $1.09 trillion. The dominance index of the main digital coin is at a mark of 54%. But this is the minimum value of the index for the last two years. The last time it was at this mark was in April 2019.

## Bitcoin dominance in simple terms

Bitcoin dominance index shows the share of its capitalization in the cryptocurrency market. Until recently, the main digital coin and several other altcoins from the top 5 could boast a huge influence in the market, but as cryptocurrencies develop, bitcoin dominance is decreasing, which is considered a sign of healthy change in the market, as investors are interested in a broader range of assets.

Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance can be calculated as follows: the capitalization of the main cryptocurrency divided by the total market capitalization of cryptoassets and multiplied by 100%. By the way, CoinMarketCap aggregator was the first platform to start tracking this indicator.

## What dominance shows

The Bitcoin Dominance Index is important for understanding the overall direction of the market at the moment. If the index is declining, it means that investors have rushed towards altcoins, demonstrating a tendency to take risks in search of new names. That‚Äôs usually the case in a rising market. If altcoins are actively selling and moving into bitcoin, it means risk aversion is growing in the market and there is a shift to a more ‚Äúhard‚Äù cryptocurrency, the head of the Six Nines data center explained.

>*‚ÄúBitcoin is considered the digital equivalent of gold, so over time it is increasingly associated with the precious metal and the market patterns that unfold around gold at one stage or another,‚Äù the expert noted.*

A 1% drop in the dominance of the main cryptocurrency means an approximate 10% growth of altcoins. There is also a situation in which bitcoin dominance is falling and altcoins are rapidly growing on that background.

## Benefits for the trader

Bitcoin dominance index is used by traders to analyze the market situation and make decisions about entering the asset. Based on this index, traders determine the strategy: take a position in the bitcoin market, or move capital to altcoin markets, or hedge their assets in currencies or stabelcoins.",4,2021-04-06 10:38:11,1

BTC,Altcoin,Kaspa (KAS) ü¶æ: Redefining Blockchain Through High-Speed Block Production,"Kaspa is a Layer 1 blockchain that sets itself apart with a unique technology known as blockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). Traditional blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, follow a linear structure where one block follows the next. Kaspa, however, employs a blockDAG, allowing multiple blocks to be generated and confirmed simultaneously, which significantly increases throughput and lowers confirmation times. In practical terms, this means Kaspa can handle a much higher number of transactions per second compared to traditional blockchain designs, positioning it as a highly scalable solution for a variety of use cases.
In the world of Layer 1 blockchains, scalability is a recurring challenge. Many networks struggle to balance speed, decentralization, and security‚Äîa problem known as the blockchain trilemma. Kaspa‚Äôs approach is groundbreaking because it essentially bypasses this trilemma by creating a network where transaction speed and decentralization do not come at the expense of security. With the potential to produce 10 blocks per second, Kaspa has one of the fastest block production rates in the industry, making it suitable for high-frequency applications such as decentralized exchanges, gaming, and financial transactions.
Kaspa‚Äôs recent performance on the charts shows a corrective wave pattern, suggesting it may currently be undergoing a short-term retracement. This could be a buying opportunity for long-term investors, especially if Kaspa finds support at key Fibonacci retracement levels around $0.066 and $0.08. The price is also approaching a critical area on its exponential moving average (EMA), which has historically provided a strong support base during downturns. While it‚Äôs experiencing a consolidation phase, Kaspa‚Äôs fundamentals remain robust, and its unique technology positions it as a potential leader in blockchain scalability.

I've been diving deep into various projects, and I wanted to share my perspective on what could be the blue chips for the upcoming bull run.

Real estate projects like [Parcl](https://app.parcl.co/) caught my attention. The intersection of crypto and real estate has incredible potential, and Parcl seems to be paving the way for innovative solutions.

Post-quantum cryptography is also gaining traction, and projects like [Qanplatform](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/qanplatform/) are at the forefront. Security is paramount in the crypto space, and investing in advanced cryptographic solutions could be a game-changer.

I can't possibly forget GambleFi projects like [Shuffle](https://shuffle.com/) that will bring a new dimension to the crypto space, adding an element of excitement to the ecosystem.¬†

Real-world assets (RWA) are also gaining prominence, and [Realio](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/realio-network/) seems to be making waves in this space. You'd agree with me that investing in projects tied to tangible assets provides a sense of stability amidst the crypto volatility.

BTC,Altcoin,How about bringing an old coin to life? ,"I have been looking into bitcoin alternatives which have been there for a while and not so popular due to lack of listing or the devs wanted it that way. 

One of those coins is HUSH. During 2017 bull market it has performed but then a downward spiral. But surpirsingly HUSH still has a strong dev team doing frequent releases. Its PoW coin and very similar profile and supply like #Bitcoin. Those Who Missed Out on #Bitcoin can still create an opportunity for their own good.

I have been looking into other altcoins as well, but the market is saturated with 10s of 1000s of coins. Only insiders are making money out of it. What about normal retailers. Normal people who wants to invest? Nobody cares about them really. You either fall into a scam or buy a coin which has grown to its potential. I am talking about people who can only invest in 100s.

So why not try out a coin which has been there for a while, good dev support and wallets. Be the early buyers with very little money. Just invest 10 dollars. It's nothing to lose. 

By the way, HUSH is not easy to buy. It's on TradeOgre or you can mine it. For a normal person TradeOgre will work better.

Think about it fellow reddit people. Is 10 dollars to much to lose to try something out.

Please note this is not for people who had success in trading. But for retailers getting into the crypto market very late.

BTC,Altcoin,Why Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Is in Trouble,"
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is in trouble. It‚Äôs perhaps the most controversial cryptocurrency ever. Just stating the name online can spark heated debate and flame wars. But now BCH is in a technical crisis.

BCH was thought of long before August 2017‚Äôs hard fork of the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain. Its origins are the Bitcoin block size debate that began in 2015. Basically, the block size debate was an argument about how big blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain should be. Small blockers oppose a block size limit increase because that would mean greater centralization of mining. Bigger blocks earn more fees for miners, and larger miners can better afford the bandwidth and mining hardware necessary for bigger blocks. The system of voting with computing power or hash rate favors larger miners and allows the majority to enforce conditions on the minority. Also, miners‚Äô interests can conflict with users‚Äô. Bigger blocks can compromise the security of Bitcoin, making it more difficult for full nodes to download and verify the entire blockchain. The fee market that arises will help solve the problems of transaction confirmation and acceptance. Finally, scalability issues should be fixed with sidechains that allow transactions off the blockchain. Small blockers, prefer decentralization to efficiency.

Big blockers want a block size limit increase because a limit increase would mean greater support for more users. Bigger blocks would benefit users by making transactions more inexpensive, accessible, and reliable. Scaling the network to become a global system capable of handling numerous transactions per second would make it easier for new adopters and ordinary people to use Bitcoin. Smaller blocks mean that transactions take much longer to become confirmed and have a greater risk of not being confirmed. Merchants need to accept payments within seconds in order for Bitcoin to be widely adopted. Finally, the fee market that arises from blocks reaching the limit hurts users. Fees should be as low as possible. Big blockers prefer efficiency to decentralization. So they decided to fork the Bitcoin blockchain in August and create a new cryptocurrency as an experiment.

Although the price of BCH has increased since its creation, it is showing relative weakness compared to the overall crypto market. It has been hit hard by the 2018 bear market, but it is down more than its peers BTC, Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC). On the Coinbase/GDAX exchange, BTC is down 50% from its all-time high, ETH down 40%, and LTC down 50%. But BCH is down over 85%. On the Kraken exchange, BCH is down 75%. And BCH has underperformed other major cryptos year-to-date and in February.",13,2018-02-26 19:00:05,8

BTC,Altcoin,A Guide To ICO investing Bitcoin Millions: Is It Too Late For You?,"You've been probably reading the news about all those kids who manage to become filthy rich simply by investing in Bitcoin in 2013.

News like these usually make me feel mad because I missed the chance to buy Bitcoin when one of my friends told me that I should invest in Bitcoin back in 2014. 

Now the Bitcoin seems more like a gold mine rush because everybody thinks that he would be able to make millions easily. 

If you are like one of those people who want to make a quick buck on cryptocurrency, I advise you stop. You lost the game here. There's no easy money to be made on the crypto market anymore.

Here's Why Making Money On Cryptocurrency Will Become Harder In 2018

The market is oversaturated with cryptocurrency traders. There're people who are going to take your money because you simply don't know the game good enough.

Right now the whole market cap is crushing and in order to make profits, you need to be really smart.

Let's say you want to buy Cardano at its current price of $0,45 per coin. You see the graph and you notice that Cardano used to cost $0.77 a few weeks ago, and you are like maybe Cardano will go up again, and you buy Cardano. 

Who sold you the coin?

Is it the exchange itself? Is it Binance who sold you the coin?

The answer is no!

You bought the coin from people who already were holding the coin. They got the coin before the coin hit the exchange. They bought it dirt cheap on ICO presale level and they sold it to you 20x or even 30x the ICO price. 

If you know some good coins that are already listed on coinmarketcap.com Stop there! It is usually too late to acquire them because somebody both them a few years ago. Usually, those are the people who joined the ICO presales or the team members of the blockchain project.

Cryptocurrency market is very dynamic and people got hyped easily. So what should you do instead if you want to still benefit from the cryptocurrency market?

This what I am also doing...

Be the one who buys the coin first!

Go online and start researching cryptocurrency projects that are up to launch an ICO and start following their social media. There are few major important things that I am looking for:

Factor #1 The Main Lesson From A Coin That Cost Less Than $1 in 2015 And Reached $1,389 In Less Than 3 years! 

Every cryptocurrency project needs a strong team of developers. They'll be the one who would create the project. Also, I'm trying to invest my ETH into projects that have young teams. Many of the successful crypto projects have very young teams. 

For example, the founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin started the project when he was in his early twenties. The cost of Etherium hit $1,389 at its peak, and back in 2015, an Ethereum cost less than $1.

Is there a chance to found the next Vitalik Buterin? Just look for a young enthusiastic team.

Factor #2 Good Marketing And Big Idea

Whenever I invest in a project I aim to go with the idea that is practical. I don't invest in projects that I don't understand. I will visit the website and the social media to see if the team has good marketing. If I like the website and the idea I would go to the Telegram channel of the project.

You can learn a lot just by visiting a Telegram chat. I would ask a few questions to see if the team is responding. I used to think that the size of the Telegram group would matter, but there are a lot of ways to invite fake bots to a Telegram chat. So I would stay away from a group that has way too many unresponsive chat visitors.

Factor #3 ICO That Is Going To Make You Money vs ICO That Is Trying To Steal Your Hard-Earned Money

I do internet marketing for 4 years now. Whenever I go to a blockchain website I notice that a big majority of the projects don't have a long-term vision.

They are all about raising money with the ICO. I am just curious what happens next? So, I usually read the whitepaper, try to find out if they have set a road map. Usually, they have that stated on the website under a ""Road Map"".

So, I look for projects that have a long-term vision. It is very hard to see ROI in less than two years. I think this is the reasonable cycle.

ICO Projects You Should Consider

I am not a financial advisor. However, I did a great deal of thinking and researching ICOs. I am going share a list the top 3 ICOs that I personally invested in and I intend to invest in once the ICO is out for a presale.

1. Rentberry

I invested in Rentberry earlier this year. They already had a solid base of customers and they're building a decentralized home rental platform. Based in the USA, the team is supercool. They raised 30M, unfortunately if you want to invest now the project ICO project is already closed.

2. CrowdMachine

CrowdMachine has a very good idea. Their project aims to develop a system that requires no coding, enabling anyone to create decentralized apps and smart contracts without limitation. So basically, with CrowdMachine everybody will be able to create a blockchain without knowing how to code. This ICO start early April.

3. Cryptopus

Cryptopus might be a long shot. However, back in 2013 Etherium was a very long shot as well. This Russian ICO develops a blockchain brokerage marketplace. I personally know the team because once I stumble upon the project, I wanted to be a part of it, and I joined as an advisor. 

In Conclusion:

If you are looking for a coin that has a huge potential you might want to take a look at Cryptopus and CrowdMachine. 

CrowdMachine has a BIG idea and might change the blockchain game forever. ICO is out soon so definitely worth following.

Cryptopus has a very cool young team and amazing advisors on the board. ICO is currently ON! Could Cryptopus be the next Ethereum? 

We are about to see!

Let's Fuckin Go! + LEGO = $LFGO



The above is a power, common mantra not only in the crypto space, but the wider world as a whole, and we are the embodiment of it. By combining LFG with LEGO and using AI to brickify just about anything inside and outside the crypto space - we meme the memes, adapt to new trends and can quickly play into any new metas.



With nothing but insane normie appeal, LFGO is a super fun, adaptable concept, and branding that is instantly recognisable, yet still original in so many ways! 



LFGO started its life on pump fun back on April 8th, where it quickly gained popularity. However, the original Dev pulled the rug and the community picked up the pieces and took over. And what a take over it was. Grabbing the bull by the horns, the dedicated team and community have taken this project from strength to strength. They've taken a simple idea and turned it into a fully functioning crypto project, with a core team of 37 working around the scenes and nothing but a bright future ahead.



Oh, and did we mention that LFGO has got the BEST website in crypto, showcasing the amazing content all created by the community - come and take a look!

BTC,Altcoin,Future Bitcoin,"Many people will tell you that Bitcoin is king.   


  It would be hard to argue against their point but I'd like to specify that Bitcoin does in fact appear to be a king, king of speculation. It has become an online casino for the uninformed and indifferent and while it has drawn mainstream attention to some of the many benefits of modern cryptography and distributed ledger technology, it has also become a burdensome anchor, weighing down new projects and forcing developers to consider appeasing a fickle speculative market when they could be making real progress on the tech side off things. Immoderate use of phrases like ""to the moon"" or ""wen lambo?"" superfluously congest all communication channels and misinformation proliferates perpetually by a crowd that simply can't be reasoned with. I won't even get into the subjects of apparent coordinated downvoting and the suspected existence of dedicated agenda pushing groups because that in itself would be speculation, although a strong case can be made based on the regularly submitted evidence. While there has been remarkable progress made in the general crypto-space infrastructure, the point is- There's still a lot left to be desired.

 Some might say that this is it, this is as far as it can go, but until grandma is using crypto (whether she knows it or not), then I wouldn't be so quick to rule out new advancements. 

So while Bitcoin may be king of speculation and it clearly leaves room for improvement, then perhaps an as-of-now undiscovered or yet-to-be created crypto will quietly rise up the ranks to the position of king of adoption based simply on meeting the common general desires for convenience, scalability/functionality, privacy, and security of investment (both network protection and relative stability in price).  


  These are primary areas of interest that will require continual improvement. Rght now Bitcoin sits relatively stagnant considering the many technological innovations that have been made in the decade since it's inception. 

&#x200B;

  I do have a project in mind myself but we all know how that'd go if I included it, so I won't. Also, the point of this post is to exchange information with each other, not push a project. With that in mind, are there any projects that you feel exceptionally passionate about and that you believe has the potential to break on through to grandma and ultimately, global mainstream adoption?

&#x200B;

Please don't just list names, I know some still will but please try to read the question before you answer.

Give examples of what it is that makes your project so pervasive (issuance model, incentives, true decentralization).

If use case is your example, please specify why.

Please try to be helpful/respectful. If you need to say things like ""u all idiots u gonna lose everything"", then just say it to yourself in your room all alone. I will never understand the mentality behind a real thinking person saying something like that. How did you even end up here, clicking through links, apparently reading up on this? If you're a professional troll or simply a general ""misery seeking company"" type, just find somewhere else to try to spread that.

&#x200B;

Also, since we are discussing adoption and areas that can be improved upon, what are your ideas that can improve things in crypto overall?",2,2019-03-03 17:31:43,2

New old cryptocurrency?

Some details:

1.The name is very confusing because there is another bytecoin (1:1 copy of bitcoin) launched April 1st, 2013.

2.It looks like this one has no relation to sha-256d-based bytecoin. I propose BCN abbreviation to avoid confusing situations.

3.It was started July, 2012 (according to its site)

4.Its network is ok and mining is possible

5.It's mined by 2-3K PCs.

6.Specifications:

* Algorithm: CryptoNight; Block time: 120 seconds (2 minutes); 

* Difficulty retargets each block;

* Block reward decreases each block according to the formula: BaseReward = (MSupply - A)/218, where MSupply=(264 - 1) atomic units and 'A' is amount of already generated coins; 

* One coin is divisible down to 8 decimal places (divisible up to 108); 

* Total coins: 18 446 744 073 709 551 616 atomic units (= 184.46 billion BCN)

7.CryptoNight is ""a new memory-bound algorithm for the proof-of-work pricing function. It relies on random access to a slow memory and emphasizes latency dependence. As opposed to scrypt every new block (64 bytes in length) depends on all the previous blocks. As a result a hypothetical ""memory-saver"" should increase his calculation speed exponentially"".

Too many memecoins will rug the everyday retail investor.

$DOG which is on Bitcoin, and is already the biggest memecoin on BTC and is growing rapidly. The community here on Reddit r/Doggotothemoon is still small, but over on X it is HUGE. 
@leonidas minted 100B $DOG coins and released them all at once. Yes 100% now in circulation! No VC allocation no marketing team allocation.

$DOG is a true fair memecoin that is destined to explode. The trading volume on the exchanges for $DOG generally is the highest of all the memecoins. @leonidas will not pay listing fees for exchanges yet still the number of exchanges listing $DOG is increasing.

$DOG is now one of the top memecoins and it‚Äôs done it organically with no BS manipulation because $DOG holders believe in it, as they believe in BTC. 
Remember most memecoins now are just done by big teams that churn out multiple memecoins every week and it‚Äôs all in their favour not the retail investor.

Do yourself a favour and buy $DOG now while it‚Äôs cheap. And ffs look how damn cute it is!

BTC,Altcoin,Altcoin Mythbusting: Do Alts Pump after big $BTC moves?,"**Tl;DR: For the BTC pumps I looked at, Altcoins bleed during but typically pump to higher highs afterwards. I'm using this knowledge to diversify my portfolio with** [some smaller-cap, high-potential](https://cryptopragmatist.com/sign-up/) **alts.**

\-

>**""Alt season is coming.""**

Or, at least, that‚Äôs what the internet says. After parabolic moves by Bitcoin, common wisdom tells us altcoins pump shortly after.

On the heels of this latest Bitcoin all-time-high, will it happen again? We can never be sure, but we can use data from the past to better inform our investing decisions.

# 

# The Data

Today, we‚Äôll be looking at four time periods where Bitcoin pumped, then seeing if altcoins followed along in its path. This is admittedly not a lot of data-you could even argue its merely anecdotal. But if we see that altcoins performed well every time, well, it‚Äôs probably enough to reallocate some capital to an alt portfolio make sure we‚Äôre well exposed, just in case.

To analyze altcoins as a basket, we‚Äôll look at two charts. First, the [Total 2 Index](https://es.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-TOTAL2/), which shows the total market cap of the top 125 cryptos without BTC. This index is not static, meaning altcoins are constantly entering and falling off of the list.

Second, we‚Äôll look at [Bitcoin dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/), as if altcoins pump but Bitcoin dominance stays the same, your money was better off in Bitcoin (a less risky asset).‚Äã

# 

# The Moves

We'll be taking a look at the following four Bitcoin moves:

**‚Äã**

1. **End of 2017 Bull Run: 11/13/2017 - 12/16/2017, +242%, $6,000 - $20,000**
2. **Bear Market Pump: 6/10/2019 - 6/26/2016, +82%, $7,500 - $13,000**
3. **New ATH: 12/12/21 - 1/08/21, +134%, $18,000 - $45,000**
4. **Summer 2021 Pump: 7/21/21 - 7/30/21, +44%, $29,000 - $42,000‚Äã**

&#x200B;

# Move 1: End of 2017 Bull Run

* **11/13/2017 - 12/16/2017**
* **+242%**
* **$6,000 - $20,000**

A 242% gain in about 33 days might never happen to Bitcoin again, but if you were early enough to be there, it was mind-blowing. It was a time of infinite optimism and maybe that‚Äôs why alts surged after the ATH.

https://preview.redd.it/j2e92aohz7v71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b92c547219d71b5161c56073459f08a416570fc2

During this month-long bitcoin pump, the market cap of the top 125 altcoins moved up by 184%, meaning Bitcoin dominance went up and your money was better off in Bitcoin.

Still, not a bad result for a month of investing. But as Bitcoin dropped 23% from the 16th of December to the 4th of January, altcoins continued to pump another 123% for a total gain of 544% over 54 days: over 10% a day on average. That‚Äôs a handy little gain.

**Results:** Altcoins pumped alongside Bitcoin, then continued to pump another 123% while Bitcoin retraced.

# Move 2: 2019 Bear Market Pump

* **6/10/2019 - 6/26/2019**
* **+82%**
* **$7500 - $13000**

This move is a bit different than the others, coming in the midst of a pretty serious bear market. Nonetheless, from April to June 2019, Bitcoin tripled in price, with a final 16-day crescendo coming in early summer. Bitcoin put in a near 2x move, coming within striking distance of the all time high.

Altcoins pumped about 45% alongside Bitcoin's 82% move upwards, but afterwards? A whole lot of nothing. Over the next 22 days, Bitcoin erased its gains with a 50% drop while altcoins also got smoked, dropping 80%. While the total market cap of the top 125 altcoins hit a local high on June 26 of around 140 billion, it would take over a year to reach those levels again on August 26, 2020.

&#x200B;

**Results:** Over this time period, your money was better off in Bitcoin on the way up **and** the way down. Bitcoin dominance, with a few small slides, trended up from about 50% of total crypto market cap to nearly 75%. A blowout victory for $BTC bulls.

# Move 3: 2020 Q4 All-Time-High

* **12/12/20 - 1/08/21**
* **+134%**
* **$18,000 - $45,000**

In this euphoric, 134%, 27-day move, Bitcoin doubled its previous ATH with only five red days. It was a Bitcoiner‚Äôs wildest dream, and the Q4 move everyone has fixated on since. Bitcoin bulls love this move because after an 18-day, -28% retracement in January, it shot up again another 41% through the end of January and beginning of February.

But what happened to alts during and after the pump? During the BTC pump, the top 125 alts saw a 74% gain. So Bitcoin dominance went up, but not by much.

It was during Bitcoin's drop that altcoins flew. After Bitcoin reached a local top on the 8th of January, it collapsed by 15% and altcoins responded negatively with a 20% drop. But while Bitcoin continued to trend down with another 25% dip from the 14th to the 28th, alts put in a 33% move to the upside. After that, altcoins enjoyed a 100-day, 349% move upwards through May 12th. Bitcoin dominance slid 33% from 60% to 40%, a near all-time-low level. This was peak altcoin season.

Let‚Äôs keep in mind that Bitcoin although enjoying a few new all time highs throughout this period, Bitcoin dominance slid lower and lower. Bitcoin wasn't a bad investment by any means, but alts performed phenomenally.

**Results:** A euphoric, monthlong pump doubled the former ATH for Bitcoin and lead to a lot of very happy altcoin investors. Bitcoin dominance steadily trended down although price trended up.

# Move 4: Summer 2021 Pump

* **7/21/21 - 7/30/21**
* **+44%**
* **$29,000 - $42,000**

Pulling the market out of a three-month bleed, this nine-day move pumped Bitcoin‚Äôs price by up 44%. It‚Äôs the smallest Bitcoin pump we‚Äôre covering but also the most recent, which might give us a few clues as to how today‚Äôs market behaves.

https://preview.redd.it/12f8j52uz7v71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0716ddd6e5a180d421cd3c211b15d6d328569634

* **An ATH rejection, then breakout**: An ATH rejection followed by a breakout, would most likely put an ‚Äòaltcoin season‚Äô on hold, but would still be good news for altcoins. As we‚Äôve seen, when Bitcoin pumps, altcoins pump, just not as much. Maybe after a big move and a retracement, we‚Äôd finally see a real altcoin season. Bitcoin dominance is still pretty low compared to historical levels, so it‚Äôs possible we need to see it take some market cap back before altcoins can run.
* **Bitcoin stability:** If Bitcoin just hangs out within $5k-sh of where it is today, altcoins will probably run. That chart would look pretty similar to our late 2017/early 2018 altcoin season, but could signal an end to the bull run.
* **Bitcoin dips:** Bitcoin could still take a dip, and that could mean who-knows-what for altcoins. In 2019, it was bad for alts, in the winter of 2020/2021, it was great for alts. On the bright side, it would probably mean an extended bull run, as pretty much every BTC all time high has been eventually followed by an explosion to higher levels.

If history tells us anything, it‚Äôs that altcoin pumps nearly always follow big Bitcoin moves: as to how big those moves are and how long after new Bitcoin ATHs they come, that‚Äôs anyone guess. These are a few possibilities I‚Äôve deemed to be pretty likely, and I, for one, am stocking up on altcoins. [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) could be a good choice for more conservative investors while smaller alts look appealing to risk-tolerant crypto buyers.

The normal advice still stands: stay diversified, own Bitcoin as a backup, and have a plan to take profits.

BTC,Altcoin,Bumper finance: the first defi volatility equalizer. Protect your ETH and BTC from price crashes,"Hey guys,

Thought I'll share this with you.

Bumper is a novel solution to the problem of crypto currency volatility. It basically protects your investment like ETH from negative price movements while you are still exposed to price increases (in contrast to a stop loss). It‚Äôs a crazy complex endeavor, but from what the team dropped in their office hours live stream they cracked the code. Simulations and back testing of the price movements of ETH and BTC in the last 4 years look great (see simulation report at the end of the text). If you want to know how it works, check their lite paper.

They recently started working with digital mob,which certainly belong to the best coders in the space. They worked for Maker Dao, Filecoin and a few other successful projects. Thing is, you can‚Äôt just hire them, they get a lot of requests every day. What they want is a portion of the tokens of what¬† they think is going to be the next big thing. So they are pretty confident this will work out.

There was a presale around 1 year ago, but presalers seems to have capitulated at some point because of slow development. Price is around x5 lower if I am correct. It pumped a bit in the last month, but nothing too crazy. They want to launch in August. Marketing will therefore ramp up in July. I think the narrative of price protection¬† is so simple everyone gets it, so it should be easy to market. 


At the moment, it is really under the radar with 6-7mil MC and hardly anyone is active in their channel.

Some deep-dive extra points why bumper is revolutionary for risk hedging (in crypto and probably at some point for tradfi, there is interest from¬†for an enterprise version) 

Main advantages of bumper compared to traditional risk hedging (written for ETH, same goes for WBTC at launch and more assets in the future):

1. Stop Loss without sacrificing upside potential: By employing Bumper to safeguard ETH holdings, investors benefit from a price protection mechanism that mitigates downside risk without impeding the asset's ability to appreciate in value during upward market movements. In contrast to a normal stop loss, with Bumper you don't get priced out when the market surges back after the price fell below floor level, which happens all too often after a stop loss got triggered. 



2. Maximising risk price efficiency: Bumper introduces a groundbreaking mechanism where premium charges are determined dynamically based on different parameters like the volatility of the asset observed during the locking period, in contrast to upfront premium charges commonly practiced in traditional options. At the core of Bumper‚Äôs design is the idea that all risks, and profits, are shared. This means that protection takers are unconcerned about whether they are paying a fair price, and protection makers do not have to compete with other makers. Bumper measures and dynamically responds to price changes and demand, shares liquidity risk among liquidity providers, and shares the cost of risk among protection buyers. With this approach, Bumper maximizes the efficiency of pricing (valuing) price risk and converting it to a stable yield. This innovation, resulting from 2.5 years of collaborative efforts with esteemed experts and professors, positions Bumper as a cost-effective alternative, typically offering a 10% lower premiums than conventional options.


3.¬† Ease of Use: Bumper offers a user-friendly experience, making it highly accessible and straightforward, even for non-professional traders. With Bumper, implementing risk management strategies and protecting ETH holdings requires just a few clicks, eliminating the complexity and learning curve associated with traditional option desks. This intuitive interface empowers users to secure their assets efficiently and conveniently, without the need for specialized financial expertise or extensive market knowledge.

4. bETH Utility: Bumper enhances user utility by returning bETH, a representation of locked ETH, enabling users to unlock additional value from their locked assets and participate in a broader spectrum of decentralized finance (Defi) opportunities. bETH can be as collateral with the interesting feature of following eth's price but never falling below the chosen price floor, which gives it special properties in terms of how liquidations will work.

5. Efficient hedging: Bumper eliminates the need for additional hedging capital by relying solely on the underlying asset, ETH, thereby removing the requirement to reserve funds for purchasing put options. This distinctive feature ensures that the original ETH holdings are protected, rather than relying on derivative products, fostering a more direct and secure hedging approach.

BTC,Altcoin,BTC: The Rise and Fall,"I think of myself as a hugely positive person, and I am, especially when it comes to investments and even more so when it comes to looking at the future of Crypto's.

But Bitcoin. I just cant be.

The idea behind BTC was a decentralised, anonymous, fast and safe way of making payments worldwide.

Well, as far as i can see it does NONE of these things aside to allowing worldwide payments.Its block chain and the transactions you make whether you like to believe it or not, are as watched, if not more watched than your online or high street bank transfers and just as easily traceable. Anonymous? NO.

Bitcoin has never been quick in its transactions. they used to take up to an hour but that did go down to around 20 minutes in some transactions I made. Still far too long to make say, payments in a shop. Which is the idea behind these currencies. However my most recent experiences with BTC are a lot of the fuel for this post. When trading things like Crypto's, the most frustrating thing is slow moving money, and this would be the same if you were using a Crypto to buy in a shop.

It took the Blockchain 9 DAYS to confirm an $80BTC payment, and a second time and third time it took 5 days, and 6 days to clear payments of around the same amount. Secondly the smaller the transaction the longer it usually takes to clear. How does that make it use-able in any situation other than a bubble to jump on board and make some quick cash?

Is BTC only for the UBER rich and thats why small transactions are punished with the same fee's as large transactions, wiping out a massive % of say a $50 transaction before it even reaches the buyers hands?

It costs as much to send BTC from a vendor to your wallet than it did to send normal currency from the UK to the US 15 years ago!

You can argue that the Blockchain and BTC needs work and we should give it time, but there are coins out there already doing everything BTC should be doing and they're worth a fraction (and I mean around 1/1,000,000th. Yes millionth.) of the price.

COLX is currently $0.015 cents and has anonymity akin to that of XMR Monero and transaction speed like Ive never witnessed. COLX is by far the fastest Ive come across, and With anonymity like XMR's. It wipes the floor with BTC in terms of worldwide usability, which is what these things are meant to be all about!

Everyone seems to be so caught up in the bubble that is BTC that they just keep pumping it up with out seeing the facts:

IT IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS!!

If you were trading US equities and a penny stock company popped showing a great concept and made 5 big promises of what it would be in the near future, and it failed pull off ANY of these things, Would you hold? Would you keep buying?

Of course you wouldn't, you're an investor not a moron.

You would see its either a lie and an intentional bubble, or a failed company/idea/team and you would short the crap out of it..

BTC is dead. By this I mean Technologically. The only thing holding it up is blind faith. It moved so fast every one wanted a piece of the pie and we've all made our money on it i'm sure.

The price may continue higher, It may hit its forecast $60k next year. Im not saying it wont. What I am saying is, If it reaches that $60k projection it wont hit it because its worth that, it will hit it cause the faith tank Isn't empty yet.

Its time to move on and put your money in projects that can achieve what they're planning.

Chucking your money into BTC on blind faith is not one .

One of the ways to distinguish a good project from a less good one is to pay attention to¬†**how the chart responds**¬†when the market goes up after a dip.

Good projects with strong fundamentals have already¬†**shown signs of a strong reversal**, gaining¬†**50%**,¬†**100%**¬†or even more from the lowest point touched during the market crash.



One of those projects is certainly¬†**$KENDU (Kendu Inu),**¬†which went from as low as¬†**$68M**¬†back to almost¬†**$150M**¬†as soon as the market showed some strength.

¬†

That is an extremely bullish indicator to look for in a project.

**COMMUNITY SENTIMENT**

Another important thing to look for is¬†**how active the community is during a market crash**.

¬†

**Most ""projects"" go straight to zero or almost in this phase.**¬†People in the TG group go silent, stop raiding, are sad, and eventually start looking around at the next shiny thing.

This never happens at¬†**$KENDU**.

There is such a¬†**big core group of OGs**¬†who are always ready to¬†**work and lead by example**. People coming to the Telegram group are always surprised by the warm welcome and the work ethic of the¬†**$KENDU army**.

**The Kendu Inu community is more active during the dips than most communities are at ATHs.**

You want a¬†**very active community**¬†that is¬†**always positive**¬†about the project and ready to spread the word, especially when all the others around you are¬†**too lazy and depressed**¬†to do so.

https://preview.redd.it/cbf2wjpgjvdd1.jpg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bb459e0141fb998c9ba991fd2e300793ff1b977

  
**COMMUNITY GROWTH**

**But how fast is this strong Kendu community growing?**

Well, let's look at the data. Data does not lie.

¬†

**The project launched on Feb 21st.**

**May 1st -->**¬†**160**¬†members of the subreddit -¬†**1300**¬†on-chain holders ‚Äì listed on¬†**1 CEX**

**Jun 1st --> 1345**¬†members of the subreddit-¬†**6000**¬†on-chain holders ‚Äì listed on¬†**2 CEXs**

**July 19th -->**¬†**3554**¬†members of the subreddit ‚Äì¬†**12701**¬†on-chain holders ‚Äì listed on¬†**14 CEXs**

https://preview.redd.it/ay6ubk5jjvdd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98f10c2f3a8d6be101230fe6095bc25a64c97007

**100% organic**, after a slow start, Kendu Inu has seen exponential growth in the last couple of months.

**Kendu Inu has a very strong floor**¬†thanks to diamond-handed holders with a big vision, a beautiful chart,¬†**holders count growing daily**¬†and good supply distribution where nobody holds more than roughly¬†**2%.**

¬†

**That is the result of a combination of:**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Fair launch

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Organic growth

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No supply to KOLs

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No big influencers calling you from the start and letting jeets form the floor.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† An army with an extreme work ethic

**SUPPORTED BY SHYTOSHI KUSAMA¬† - TOP 50 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN CRYPTO ‚Äì**

**Shytoshi Kusama**¬†was included in the list of the¬†**top 50 most influential people in the whole crypto space**¬†earlier this year, as he has a huge reputation and a¬†**multi-billion dollar project**¬†under his leadership.

He recently left an interview where he said his goal for¬†**SHIB**¬†is to reach¬†**One trillion dollar**¬†market cap ($1000b).

He would never risk any of that to support a project that is either a¬†**scam**¬†or a mere¬†**pump and dump.**

As of today, Kusama has followed the page on X and joined the Telegram group to say hi and ask for details after¬†**$KENDU**¬†went from¬†**$2.8M**¬†to¬†**$60M**¬†market cap in just a few days.



He asked: ""**Why up so much? lol**""



It has also been confirmed that he has been holding a fat bag of¬†**$KENDU**¬†since at least¬†**$1M**¬†market cap.

Even though all details have yet to be revealed, it is known that¬†**$KENDU**¬†will play a role in the Shib ecosystem, which might explain Shytoshi's involvement in Kendu Inu.

Make no mistake, though, Miazaki has always said that¬†**Kendu has its own identity**¬†and will not just be one of the small dogs existing under the SHIB umbrella.

At the same time, being a partner of the 2^(nd)¬†biggest meme coin that ever existed from such an early stage is an extraordinary achievement.

https://preview.redd.it/40n7n95rjvdd1.jpg?width=848&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50b589b892f9d21e99e0c28b03f2118bdc922d41

  
**COINBASE LIKES THE STOCK**

News from last week:¬†**Coinbase Wallet**¬†showcased¬†**Kendu Inu**¬†in their new video ad (you can find it pinned on their X page)

**$KENDU**¬†is the only meme project displayed there that is not in the multi-billions of market cap.



To be specific, these are the market caps of all the coins/tokens displayed in the video ad (at the time of the video being posted):

**KENDU**: $104 Million  
**USDC**: $33 Billion  
**SOL**: $66 Billion  
**BTC**: $1.2 Trillion  
**ETH**: $371 Billion  
**USDT**: $112 Billion  
**MATIC**: $5.0 Billion  
**PEPE**: $3.7 Billion



The second smallest meme¬†**coin**¬†in the video is¬†$PEPE, which is sitting at¬†$5.1b, about¬†40x¬†from where¬†$KENDU¬†is right now.

**Read between the lines, people.**

The craziest thing about it all is that Dev said he had nothing to do with the Coinbase video ad.

He said ""I wish I could tell you I have buddies at Coinbase, but I don't.¬†**That's because of you guys.**""

**Community-driven**¬†projects focused on¬†**organic growth**¬†are the best.

**KENDU CHADS IS 99% COMPLETE**

Miazaki has always referred to Kendu as an¬†**ecosystem**, it's always been part of the name of the TG group even. He says the¬†**Kendu Inu Ecosystem**¬†**will be the biggest in DeFi**, meaning there are big plans for Kendu in these coming months.

¬†

Kendu Inu's first¬†**dAPP**¬†is about to be released to the public.

**Kendu Chads**¬†is not the final boss, it is only¬†**the first piece of a big puzzle**.

Kendu Miazaki has left hints about what that may or may not be throughout the weeks.

¬†

**What we do know about Kendu Chads to date, is:**

* You need at least¬†**5M**¬†tokens to participate
* It is not staking
* You can earn¬†**ETH**¬†with it

¬†

There are no (and never will be) ""**sell the news**"" events at¬†**Kendu Inu**. Therefore, details about Kendu will only be known once the¬†**dApp**¬†is out and ready to be used.

¬†

Even though Miazaki is an ""alpha vault"" (meaning he does not release info on the future on Kendu beforehand; he creates and then tells you what it is once it's done), he's hinted at the fact that¬†**the goal is for Kendu to last for a long time, definitely more than a cycle**.

He once responded positively to a question from someone asking him if Kendu was supposed to maintain his value during a bear market.

https://preview.redd.it/s5ix9mfxjvdd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1d565ff999ee91ed8b967f58354113a219af522

  
**WHERE IS THE MARKET HEADED?**

It is clear that the cycle is, so far, repeating itself.

**There is no better entry than now**¬†if you want to get into a project. Take a look at the picture below (right side) and see where we currently stand:

**On the final dip that usually precedes the start of the real bull run.**

We had the¬†**BTC ETF**¬†come out in January, and we have the¬†**ETH ETF**¬†going live just a few days from now.

**Rate cuts are planned for Q4**, and that, combined with the expected result of the¬†**US elections**, should signal the start of the most fun part of the¬†**bull run**.

There is going to be so much money flowing into the space.

Every project that is not a scam and has done well these past few months will inevitably do well in the coming bull run.

And when there is so much greed in the air that every shitcoin is in the green, what do you think is going to happen to such a strong project like¬†[$KENDU](https://x.com/search?q=%24KENDU&src=cashtag_click)?

""Multi billions is not the goal. It is my standard"" - Kendu Miazaki.

BTC,Altcoin,CME Gap,"11/1/2024 10:00 PM #Bitcoin Update:

The #BTC/USDT price has now formed a new CME gap at $69,249, where we should see it trading around over the weekend. I believe the price will move up to the $69,990 resistance, then come back to the CME gap before breaking out towards the $71,979 resistance. üìà

As with any pattern, we could still see it fall below the CME gap, breaking the bottom trendline of the rising wedge and dropping to $69,000, or possibly the $67,000 support, before moving back up.

**1)¬† SHYTOSHI KUSAMA INVOLVED**

**Shiba Inu lead Dev Shytoshi Kusama**, considered among the **top 50** most influential people in the whole crypto space, is confirmed to be following Kendu Inu and holding a bag since at least $1M market cap.

**Kendu Miazaki**, Kendu Inu Dev, is one of his friends, and he made sure to bring Shy in at the right time.

¬†

¬†

**2)¬† HUGE WALLETS APING (MULTIMILLIONAIRES)**

Wallets with **10+ million dollars' worth of ETH** that had been inactive since the last cycle got back to life only to buy Kendu Inu.

It has even been confirmed that a **Middle Eastern Prince** holds a bag.

Other millionaires (and multimillionaires) are confirmed holders and part of the ecosystem as well.

¬†

¬†

**3)¬† KENDU MIAZAKI**

Kendu Inu Dev ""**Miazaki**"" is an unhinged individual always ready to rock & roll.

He is a **SHIB multimillionaire** (his bag was worth 50+ million dollars at ATH IIRC), and that explains the close connection with **Shytoshi** and other **SHIB Ogs** that are now part of Kendu.

Apart from his **incredible work ethic** and **crazy personality**, him being a loaded individual makes the project much easier to trust because one of the most common reasons for projects to fail is broke millionaire-wannabe devs who can't resist the urge of dumping on everybody to make a quick buck.

He recently admitted on a X Spaces that he doesn't even have that big of a bag. He said ""**I‚Äôm maybe top 20, if even that**‚Äù.

He always says he does not do this for money because he already has money. He does this because he likes to ‚Äú**build**‚Äù ¬†and to allow other common people to become ‚Äú**stupid rich**‚Äù.

¬†

¬†

**4)¬† COMMUNITY**

What can I even say about the **Kendu Army**? Everybody knows about it.

With unmatched work ethic and always ready to spread the word, the Kendu Army is what makes Kendu‚Ä¶**KENDU**!

People who join Kendu go from being dirty, tiny-handed jeets to 7.6ft tall, muscular chads with strong and big hands.

You‚Äôre soon taught that success depends on you and to ask yourself, ‚Äú**What can I do for $KENDU?**‚Äù instead of waiting for the team to release the ‚Äú**next big thing**‚Äù and hoping for a pump while doing absolutely nothing to help.

**We‚Äôve got relentless shillers** on any social media known to humanity, people making Kendu **energy drinks**, people managing a Kendu **merch store**, people with Kendu **tattoos**, people smashing plates on their heads in the name of Kendu, and much more.

¬†

¬†

https://preview.redd.it/yj18zclypcad1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cc6f00a283f679392bf8bf5a874e7767a353358



**5)¬† ORGANIC GROWTH**

Kendu Inu fully believes in organic growth.

Apart from financing for the first **CEX** listing, so that ‚Äú**normies**‚Äù were able to join the project without having to go through **DeFi** if not tech-savvy enough to avoid being scammed, **Kendu Inu does not pay for any listing, call on Tg, post on X, video on YT or any other thing you can think of**.

All the influencers that talk about Kendu or CEXs that listed us have had to buy supply from the liquidity pool like any other person.

Kendu Miazaki explained this from the very beginning.

‚Äú**It might be slower, but it works**.‚Äù is what he used to say.

**Organic growth allows you to build a strong floor of diamond-handed holders** who fully believe in the project and do not believe in random FUD.

On the other hand, if you build your floor with people sent by influencers, everybody is ready to jeet at the first chance because they‚Äôre just there for a quick buck and do not see the bigger picture.

¬†

¬†

**6)¬† UTILITY AND SHIB ECOSYSTEM**

Even though all details have yet to be revealed, it is known that **$KENDU** will play a role in the Shib ecosystem, which might explain Shytoshi‚Äôs involvement in Kendu Inu.

Make no mistake, though, Miazaki has always said that **Kendu has its own identity** and will not just be one of the small dogs existing under the SHIB umbrella.

One of the first Kendu utilities, named **Kendu Chads**, will be released in the following weeks after being thoroughly tested for months by Miazaki‚Äôs team of developers.

¬†

https://preview.redd.it/iizlff0bqcad1.jpg?width=1195&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a5643a5c028cd785132e6788480639d6bf2ebb6





**7)¬† THE DOG OF THIS CYCLE**

‚ÄúNever two without three‚Äù.

People love dogs and always will. **DOGE** and **SHIB** were the first two dogs to reach **$10b**+ market cap.

**$KENDU** has everything it needs to be the third this coming bull run.

¬†

¬†

**8)¬†275M MARKET CAP WHEN THE MARKET WAS BLEEDING**

Kendu Inu reached an **ATH** of over **$275M market cap** when the whole crypto market, from BTC to all the shitcoins, was bleeding badly.

**Kendu is your hedge against the market** and will not wait for BTC to reach new ATHs before jumping to $1b market cap and beyond.

With that being said, when the actual bull run starts and all the random shitcoins are in green, what do you think will happen to a **strong project** like Kendu?

Multi billions are programmed.

¬†



**9)¬† BUILT ON ETH**

**Kendu Inu is only on ETH**. Love it or hate it, Ethereum is the king of all chains and sees fewer scams than all the other jeet chains such as SOL and BASE.

Since Kendu Inu is on ETH, and the liquidity pool is paired with ETH (KENDU:ETH), **when ETH goes up in value, so does KENDU**. As simple as that.

The news of the coming **ETH ETF** is super bullish news for all KENDU holders, both **short-term** and **long-term** investors.

¬†



**10)¬† GREAT-LOOKING CHART**

Even CMC, in their recent article, admitted that $KENDU chart looks very good and **on the verge of a breakout** from a pure TA standpoint, and they‚Äôre not aware of all the **alphas** behind the projects and all the future implementations that are going to be unveiled.

So, if you like technical analysis, you will like Kendu Inu chart.

¬†

¬†

https://preview.redd.it/qj0ni16trcad1.jpg?width=1443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba099af75818df6ddb9dbe44ea69aa2146656cc3



**11)¬† GOAL: FIRST MEME COIN TO EVER CROSS $100b**

While every other project in the meme sphere tries hard to reach $1b market cap, at Kendu inu, we think that to be an embarrassing goal.

While Miazaki says that **‚Äú$10b is programmed**‚Äù, meaning it is inevitable, the real goal that excites our community is to be the first meme coin ever to cross $100b market cap.

Miazaki‚Äôs bio on Telegram says: ‚Äú**Taking $KENDU to $100 BILLION and beyond!**‚Äù

Many experts expect this to be a ‚Äú**super cycle**‚Äù and even more a ‚Äú**meme super cycle**‚Äù, meaning we expect not only more liquidity to be deployed in the whole crypto space compared to 2021, but also that **meme coins will grab a much bigger % of that liquidity** flowing around compared to last cycle.

**We can then expect new ATHs for well-established projects** such as DOGE and SHIB, and that‚Äôs why, at KENDU, we‚Äôre working towards that $100b MC goal, which will not look as unrealistic at the peak of the bull run as it may does right now.

¬†



**12)¬† LOW MARKET CAP ‚â† MORE GAINS**

Many people have been led to believe that the lower the market cap of a certain token, the better chance of making a 100x or 1000x. That is SO wrong and misleading.

90% or more of the ‚Äúprojects‚Äù, especially when launched on Solana or Base, **are complete scams**. Period.

The other 0.99% are projects created with the best intentions, but that, unfortunately, are going absolutely nowhere.

**Kendu Inu, at this stage, is bulletproof**. It has proved its value to everybody. ‚Äú**We‚Äôre too big to fail**‚Äù is what Miazaki always says.

Kendu is going nowhere but up.

With such ambitious goals, a **100x means reaching about $15b market cap** (at the time of this writing), which is far from being out of reach for Kendu, especially considering we are about to enter what it‚Äôs supposed to be the **biggest cycle ever** (especially for meme coins).

Another thing to keep in mind is that when you invest in **super-low MC projects**, liquidity is so thin that any whale exiting their position leads to a cascade of sales caused by fear, especially since it‚Äôs not uncommon for investors of small projects to hold 5-10% of the total supply.

On bigger projects, instead, since liquidity is way thicker, you can **enter and exit your positions more accurately** without having nightmares about being rugged while asleep.

¬†

https://preview.redd.it/1a4row5fqcad1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ab676c8aab4bd351620875cf6b919d71522a86a

  


**13) BEAUTIFUL SUPPLY REDISTRIBUTION**

At Kendu Inu, redistribution is ongoing **24/7**. When the market cap goes up, the number of holders goes up. When the market cap goes down, even significantly, the number of holders still goes up!

And that‚Äôs counting on-chain holders only! **With millions of $ of daily volume on CEXs**, God knows how many holders we actually have.



To make money with altcoins, especially memes, you need to understand two things:

1. What a good project is
2. Buy when everybody else is afraid to do it.

Kendu IS a good project.

Now, you have the opportunity to buy or top up your bags at 40% of the ATH.



If you like Kendu, this is the best time to become part of the army. See you on the other side!

BTC,Altcoin,Advice: Invest in altcoins with BTC or ETH?,"Hello community!

If we could buy alt-coins with USD, I wouldn‚Äôt be writing you all asking for your kind help.  The fact that you need to buy alt-coins with BTC or ETH when the prices of both are so volatile has got me wondering if I am doing the math right on how to come out ahead.  With one BTC now trading around $20,000 USD when it was around $4,000 back in September, you can imagine my concerns about using BTC to invest alt-coins.  

I am interested in investing long-term and short-term on specific alt-coins.  With the price of BTC and ETH having increased so rapidly so recently, I am wondering whether I should invest in alt-coins with BTC or ETH?  And what would be the benefits or drawbacks of both?  
I suppose I have to invest in alt-coins based on (high risk) speculation, an important one being that the price of BTC will be at least $30,000 in March 2018.  Based on this speculation, is this a good time to invest in alt-coins long-term?  Short-term?  Could anyone walk me through the math of investing in an example alt-coin while BTC‚Äôs price is in an upswing?  

I want to invest in certain alt-coins long-term based on the people and innovations behind them and the real problems they offer solutions to and their related future potential.  I would also like to get in before you can buy alt-coins with USD, which I imagine is something we will see soon enough.  However, I‚Äôm trying to crunch the numbers and make sure I know what I‚Äôm getting into.

But what i am struggling with is what to do about alts when BTC goes up. Now that BTC is up about 15%, alts are still going down but not bc of satoshi value to the dollar but now because satoshi strength vs alt coin. 
So if i think that BTC is going to continue to go up, would you fork profits from alt coins even if they are well positioned back into btc because it will have more buying power compared to the alt coin ?

BTC,Altcoin,should i buy altcoins with BTC or ETH on binance.,"maybe a noob question. I transferred 1 LTC to binance few days ago to buy some alt coins which can only be done with ETH or BTC. I didn't convert my LTC to ETH as the price was hiking and was hoping for a ETH dip to convert. ETH has gained even more and if I convert my LTC to ETH now, i'll get even lesser ETH now. But given that BTC price hasn't gone up, wouldn't I get more alts if i convert my LTC to BTC rather than to ETH? So does that mean if BTC price is going down, good for people who want to buy alt coins using BTC? or am i missing something here?

And i also think ETH price increase is a worrying for a lot of newbies as if the alt coin price becomes zero they are losing more USD's right?",1,2018-01-10 08:10:18,2

BTC,Altcoin,BTC - The Rise and Fall,"I think of myself as a hugely positive person, and I am, especially when it comes to investments and even more so when it comes to looking at the future of Crypto's.

But Bitcoin. I just cant be.

The idea behind BTC was a decentralised, anonymous, fast and safe way of making payments worldwide.

Well, as far as i can see it does NONE of these things aside to allowing worldwide payments.Its block chain and the transactions you make whether you like to believe it or not, are as watched, if not more watched than your online or high street bank transfers and just as easily traceable. Anonymous? NO.

Bitcoin has never been quick in its transactions. they used to take up to an hour but that did go down to around 20 minutes in some transactions I made. Still far too long to make say, payments in a shop. Which is the idea behind these currencies. However my most recent experiences with BTC are a lot of the fuel for this post. When trading things like Crypto's, the most frustrating thing is slow moving money, and this would be the same if you were using a Crypto to buy in a shop.

It took the Blockchain 9 DAYS to confirm an $80BTC payment, and a second time and third time it took 5 days, and 6 days to clear payments of around the same amount. Secondly the smaller the transaction the longer it usually takes to clear. How does that make it use-able in any situation other than a bubble to jump on board and make some quick cash?

Is BTC only for the UBER rich and thats why small transactions are punished with the same fee's as large transactions, wiping out a massive % of say a $50 transaction before it even reaches the buyers hands?

It costs as much to send BTC from a vendor to your wallet than it did to send normal currency from the UK to the US 15 years ago!

You can argue that the Blockchain and BTC needs work and we should give it time, but there are coins out there already doing everything BTC should be doing and they're worth a fraction (and I mean around 1/1,000,000th. Yes millionth.) of the price.

COLX is currently $0.015 cents and has anonymity akin to that of XMR Monero and transaction speed like Ive never witnessed. COLX is by far the fastest Ive come across, and With anonymity like XMR's. It wipes the floor with BTC in terms of worldwide usability, which is what these things are meant to be all about!

Everyone seems to be so caught up in the bubble that is BTC that they just keep pumping it up with out seeing the facts:

IT IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS!!

If you were trading US equities and a penny stock company popped showing a great concept and made 5 big promises of what it would be in the near future, and it failed pull off ANY of these things, Would you hold? Would you keep buying?

Of course you fucking wouldn't, you're an investor not a moron.

You would see its either a lie and an intentional bubble, or a failed company/idea/team and you would short the crap out of it..

BTC is dead. By this I mean Technologically. The only thing holding it up is blind faith. It moved so fast every one wanted a piece of the pie and we've all made our money on it i'm sure.

The price may continue higher, It may hit its forecast $60k next year. Im not saying it wont. What I am saying is, If it reaches that $60k projection it wont hit it because its worth that, it will hit it cause the faith tank Isn't empty yet. 
 
Its time to move on and put your money in projects that can achieve what they're planning.

Chucking your money into BTC on blind faith is not one .

BTC,Altcoin,What got me into Kendu and has kept me in Kendu a soon to be altcoin,"I have been in crypto since 2017. I made plenty of mistakes (round tripping coins, twice) and missed plenty of opportunities. One thing I was smart enough to avoid was memecoins, but that changed, April of 2024.¬†

I finally had a plan and had followed it with BTC and was waiting on my rebuy/next move. This plan came from years of watching videos and learning about crypto, in particular the BTC cycles. My crypto/meme arc is fascinating as I got rugged for one SOL- on my second meme- because I had IRL stuff going on for 90 minutes after token launch and figured I should be good. Best loss ever as it motivated myself to research and learn about the scum bag swamp of memecoins. I dug into reddit and followed the poster history/profile uncovering the whole aspect of paid services and paid upvotes to drive traffic. I might have gotten a little intense as I invited one of the posters offering paid services into a Telegram chat (I am not including the screenshots of those again) to learn even more. One funny thing is this human seemed to think I wanted money or something.



When that learning and research ended is when I got introduced to KENDU. I was in a Telegram with some of the ‚Äòvictims‚Äô and one of them suggested Kendu. I put victims in quotes because so many people are desperate for a quick buck while another portion of people just enjoy gambling. I do not in this regard. The casino is always open and someone is always waiting to steal your money. Trust me for 99% of us the house always wins, but¬† Kendu is the anti casino and a safe bet that allows me to sleep at night.¬†



One thing that attracted me to Kendu is the ethos highlighted the lessons I had learned about investing while at the same time reinforcing the values I picked up in my crypto/meme arc (Don't pay for anything, pic a horse and stick with it, stick to the plan, etc.), BUT the concept of working for my bag was revolutionary to me. Feeling like I have some power in this was a liberating feeling that I have really taken to.



It wasn't long after finishing more research on KENDU, asking questions, and listening to everything I could that I pivoted my plan to center it around KENDU. I haven't looked back and love the community and work I have put in! If you want a deep dive into the community here is what I posted a couple days ago best way is to come in the TG and see it for yourself): https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem/comments/1eeq1v2/kendu\_community\_updated\_info\_journal/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button



With less than 24 hours to the Kendu Chads timer hitting zero and presumably the release of said dApp, this is a really cool moment for me. I have been called a bot and all types of scam-centric words, but this release will be my affirmation of a choice well made. I don‚Äôt know if the price will go up or down, but it doesn‚Äôt matter as this feature seems guaranteed to provide some real Utility in ‚Äòearning cold hard ETH‚Äô and it means I didn‚Äôt larp for upvotes or to increase my karma. I researched and listened and learned and I was correct to trust what I found and what I believed. I also know that the community will keep working and that Miazaki is built very different. He has said many things in the Spaces and they are all very real and come to fruition. It is not too late to do research and check out our Telegram. This cycle will heat up again for the real bull run and Kendu is already primed to take full advantage of that with the first aspect of the Ecosystem releasing and a ravenous and hard working community tearing up socials everyday. I believe everyone should have some exposure (hopefully to the tune of 5 million Kendu) to Kendu, but this isn‚Äôt financial advice. This is a call to do your own research! This is my real reddit account and will still be my real account when this crypto cycle is over.

TLDR: I have stayed in Kendu (on ETH‚Ä¶happy belated birthday) because of the community, OG developer experience and skill, vast connections, potential, road map (Ecosystem not a memecoin with a glass ceiling to its potential), and dare I say fun.

But the respective [ALTCOIN]/USD pairing often was only down by a single digit, e.g. -1.37%, not showing much of a dip.

In the end, was that a good time to purchase altcoins? Since..they were showing a pullback in their BTC charts..right? I'm a bit confused since compared to USD (USD-wise), the altcoin didn't really dip. But when compared to BTC, the altcoin charts showed a dip.

So what's more important? A pullback showing on the USD chart or one showing on the BTC chart?

BTC,Altcoin,I made a Chrome extension that lets you sort your coins on Binance by BTC value (among other things),"I've always been a bit annoyed at the fact that you can sort your portfolio by every column besides BTC value when imo it's by far the most useful sort order.  I figured the Binance devs probably have their hands full with backend and scalability concerns, so I decided to go ahead and make a simple Chrome extension to fix this.  Along the way I added a couple other features I thought might be useful, namely the ability to display coin balances as USD (instead of BTC) and the ability to customize the cutoff for what's considered a ""small asset.""  

It's called the Binance Enhancement Suite (Beta), and you can download it by going to the chrome [webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/) and searching for ""Binance Enhancement Suite.""  The full link was triggering the automod to remove my post for some reason.

I know the name is a bit presumptuous given how limited the feature set is right now, but I wanted to get out an MVP in order to gauge interest before committing the time to adding additional features.  Please let me know if you have any feature requests, feedback, or if you encounter any bugs!  

&nbsp;

**Important - security!**
You should always be careful downloading Chrome extensions from unknown developers, especially extensions that interact with sensitive websites like Binance.  In light of this, here are some steps you can take to stay secure:  

- Check out the code yourself (or ask your programmer friend to), which I've open sourced on [Github](https://github.com/where-are-the-faces/).  It's not the cleanest code you'll ever see, but it should be straightforward enough to tell that there's nothing fishy going on.  An easy way to make sure I didn't edit the jQuery file is to run a diff checker against it and the official slim, compressed jQuery 3.3.1 build.  

- Ensure that the code on github is the same as the code you get when you download the extension from the Chrome Web Store.  You can view the extension's files (if you don't know how there are plenty of tutorials online) and then run a diff against the Github directory.  You could also just review the Chrome Web Store source code directly, but I've always found reviewing code on Github to be easier on the eyes.  

- Alternatively, if you're up for the hassle you can download the extension directly from the github repo and install it manually.  

It should be obvious, but I guess I should state that this extension is NOT affiliated with Binance.",1,2018-01-26 02:42:20,0

**We are still so early in the game.**

¬†

Not only is the cycle repeating itself, but we also have catalysts we didn't have in the past.

We had the **BTC ETF** come out on January, and we have the **ETH ETF** going live in just a few days from now.

**Rate cuts** are planned for **Q4,** and that, combined with the **US elections,** should signal the start of the most fun part of the bull run.

There is going to be so much money flowing into the space. **You jeets are not ready for what's coming.**

Every project that is not a scam and has done well these past few months will inevitably do well in the coming bull run.

¬†

Personally, **I'm all-in on $KENDU.**

**You don't have to be like me, but if you don't at least have some Kendu you're doing it wrong. Like you hate yourself or something...**

And flash news from less than 24h ago: **Coinbase Wallet** showcased **Kendu Inu** in their new video ad.

**$KENDU** is literally the only token displayed there that is not in the multi-billions of market cap.

The second smallest token is **$PEPE**, which is sitting at **$3.7b**, about **37x** from where **$KENDU** is at right now.

¬†

**Read between the lines, people.**

Something to add to that is we are in a nice period of consolidation and supply redistribution from whales to smaller holders.

The market cap is currently around **35-40%** of what it was at the **ATH** a few weeks back, and this is honestly a great entry.

¬†

To make money in crypto, you need to understand two things that took me forever to understand:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **What a good project is**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Buy when everybody else is afraid to do it.**

**$KENDU is a good project in a space filled with shitcoins and rugpulls**. 

Now, you have the opportunity to buy or top up your bags at a great price that will most likely not last long.

**Smart people will.**

The others will have to deal with cope for a long, long time.

¬†

It is what it is.

BTC,Altcoin,Theory: Interesting data that may see altcoins survive (or even thrive) if BTC sinks (?),"- Since Dec 15, Bitcoin's dominance has fallen from 58% to 43.5%.
- Since Dec 15, altcoin market share is up 35%
- Since Dec 15, Bitcoin market share is **down** 10%
- Non-BTC trading volume is now 60+% of the market total.

Mid-June of this year was the only time BTC dominance was below 40%‚Äîit got down to 37% or so. It was due to the rise of LTC, ETH and XRP altcoins.

This is the time when the crypto market exploded overall, with the strongly-branded ""Bitcoin"" leading the charge.

The natural progression of new investors is something like BTC/LTC/ETH through Coinbase --> Gdax --> Binance/Bittrex --> Poloniex --> HitBC --> EtherDelta...

The specific exchanges in any particular case don't matter. The key is that the money is flowing in *through* BTC (and ETH, then LTC) in mainstream, simple methods (i.e. phone app) and then into increasingly complex exchanges where altcoins are the main game. Investors are leaving BTC for altcoins as they learn more about the crypto market, even as market share rises overall.

If overall market cap stays steady, while BTC dominance falls into the mid 30%s... The crypto market may be safe from a BTC crash. In fact, money leaving BTC fast may go straight back into the altcoin market.

The whales might even dive into several altcoins and spike their value overnight.",1,2017-12-21 22:32:50,0

BTC,Altcoin,Sending ETH/BTC/LTC from another exchange to Bittrex using QR Code,"Hi redditors, 

I was trying to find where to locate Bittrex QR Code in order to send ETH from Coinbase to Bittrex and couldn't find any resources. So I did a simple trick and sent just $40 to make sure it works out. (PLEASE ADVISE ME IF THIS HAS A SECURITY ISSUE).

Find QR Generator software or web app (I prefer a legit software to be safe than just a web app). But for this e.g I am using http://www.qr-code-generator.com/ 

* 1) Go to http://www.qr-code-generator.com/
* 2) Copy your wallet address from Bittrex (NOT YOUR PRIVATE KEY)
* 3)  Click text and in the message box put your wallet address.
* 4) Click generate QR CODE
* 5) Now you can scan this QR code from any of your apps to send ALT coins to your wallet.

If you are sending to Bittrex make sure you meet their minimum (right now 0.1 ETH) to see the deposit. Otherwise even if you sent the ETH, you wont be able to see it.

Ethereum - because its the biggest most well known besides btc, 100% open source, and has grown organically without being pumped 
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/

ADA - because it has a great eco system, the dev team is brilliant, and each day their dapps are growing and growing!
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/

AVAX - because its stable AF and has the ability to allow for building other sub chains with ease and security 
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/

DOGE - its an all time favorite meme and possible pump by the musky one woth his new X
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/

LINK - the oracle of all oracles period.
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/

MATIC - a great layer 2 built on eth with cheap gas fees lots of support and vc's dumping cash into.
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/

ATOM - maybe the internet of blockchains one day and the best ALT air drops out there.
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/

MANA - my metaverse play.. hope to break a buck!
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decentraland/

ACH - my longshot on the list but a coin with a ""use case"" registered to transact currency in over 200 countries has been around sinxe 2018 and IMHO the best crypto (and 1st!) fiat onramp in the industry

BTC,Altcoin,Here are my top altcoin picks for next year," As you can see, there is a high chance of having a bull run soon, as BTC has shown a good price move to the upside for several months now. IMO, it's wise to start accumulating gradually.  

But the real question is what to buy and why I think it‚Äôs the best option. I will only be listing the two tokens I‚Äôm accumulating now. One is a large cap, and the other is a low cap. Both are my biggest bags, and if you do proper research, you will agree with me that they have a high chance of leading the next bull run.  

The first is SOLANA; it's funny because I personally FUD SOL a few months ago before it had that huge price move back up. Recently, I have noticed SOL has started gaining a lot of traction, and memecoin is now gradually shifting from ETH to the Solana ecosystem. If this trend continues, then a lot of people will end up buying into SOL, and I predict the price will be around $500 for its next ATH.   

The second, which is a low-MC gem and is gradually gaining traction, is QANX. It‚Äôs a layer 1 hybrid blockchain that is EVM-compatible. One of the features about it that I feel will blow up so much is the fact that it allows developers to code smart contracts in any programming language, which QAN aims to use to onboard over 20 million developers into the blockchain, which I believe even If they are able to achieve 10% of that, then this layer 1 blockchain will be greater than ETH. And my price prediction for QANX is $1 in the next bull run.  

Anyway, please feel free to share with me what altcoins you are buying as well.

[Bitcoin 2021: Ross Ulbricht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V_SkLxgQjQ&t=369s)

Are you inspired to do something after watching that? We sure as hell are.

Bitcoin early adopters Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht helped spread the use of Bitcoin when it was less than $10 dollars and someone in this community finally made a coin to help both of them get out of jail and for its holders to make some money. We call that a win-win where I‚Äôm from.

üò≤ Who the heck is Julian Assange?! ü§¶

Julian Assange is the founder of Wikileaks, an international non-profit organization that publishes news leaks and classified media provided by anonymous sources. 

ü§Ø How about Ross Ulbricht?! ü§¶

Ross Ulbricht created the first darknet market, the Silk Road, as an exercise in free market capitalism, a website where users were free to post and buy whatever they felt necessary so long as no party was being harmed. 

These pioneers who have fought for individual freedom, now need our help to be saved from unjust prosecution and sentencing (far reaching government oversight amirite?). 

Join our fight and help raise funds for the legal defenses of Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht. Protect your rights and generate yield at the same time!

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"After checking out R/Bitcoin, I decided to cash out my bitcoin","As an accountant at an insurance firm, I started putting $5 a day into bitcoin about 8 months ago, mainly as a speculative move. I wasn't too bothered if I lost it all.

But things started feeling off when bitcoin hit its old peak and stalled. So, I did some digging on r/Bitcoin and man, it's wild out there!

The discussions lacked basic macroeconomics, yet people tossed around terms like they were Warren Buffett. Two points really got me:

1. The whole 'BTC is scarce' argument fell flat for me. Scarcity means nothing if no one wants it, even if there are only 21M coins. Econ 101, folks.
2. The 'halving cycle means moon' mantra doesn't hold water anymore with 94% of bitcoin already out there. The slow increase in supply isn't moving the market, and new buyers aren't lining up.

So, I'm out. If these kinds of ideas are what's driving bitcoin's price, I'm not convinced about its future growth. Happy to be part of this community now",6,2024-07-03 12:42:49,12

Greg Cipolaro from NYDIG says that near-term catalysts for Bitcoin are scarce, with most potential triggers coming from macroeconomic factors like inflation, employment, and Federal Reserve decisions.

While Bitcoin has gained 3% recently, riding on stock market performance, the real action might not come until later in the year. October and November have been historically strong months with historical gains of **16.1% in October and 40.6% in November**,

Are you preparing for Q4 gains or staying cautious?

Santiment data revealed 28,319 transactions worth more than $100,000 and 5,738 transactions over $1 million during this period. Despite a sharp 18% drop, Bitcoin has bounced back to around $57,000.

CryptoQuant's CEO, Ki Young Ju, highlighted that over 400,000 BTC moved to permanent holder addresses since early July, indicating strong accumulation by new whales. Meanwhile, U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of $554 million, raising concerns about the market's direction.

Many traders would still prefer to see bitcoin fall to $54,000. However, its present position on the weekly chart puts it in an excellent position to rise higher if that is the outcome.


Trader expert Craig Cobb said:


‚ÄúAs we see green shoots or signs of optimism in the market, we can begin to believe that maybe we are nearing the bottom.‚Äù

 
Cobb revealed he‚Äôll focus his time and attention on weekly pullbacks when they are available. These pullbacks, he explained, provide an ideal entry point for him and his team‚Äôs trading and investment portfolio.

 
Cobb stated that, for the time being, he will monitor the weekly and trade on the lower time frames between the 15-minute and two-hour while waiting for the daily trends to resume their upswing (if they do).


Some analysts say it‚Äôs a little bit uncertain at the moment for lower time frames, but the weekly chart is unquestionably in a very powerful trend on its first drop after establishing that.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,I analyzed the Last 3 Bitcoin halvings here's what I think will happen after the 2024 halving,"Hi

If you've never experienced a Bitcoin halving before, or if you have but are unsure what to expect, I've done a bit of research based on the last halvings. Here's what i have. 

The halving occurs every four years, cutting the reward for mining new blocks in half. The next halving will reduce rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.

Historical Price Impacts:

* 2012 Halving: Bitcoin's price surged approximately 9308% in 13 months.
* 2016 Halving: Saw a 2861% increase over 17 months.
* 2020 Halving: Resulted in a 620% increase in 11 months.

Based on some napkin math the BTC can reach a 162% price increase post-halving, with the peak expected around 420 days (14 months).

inb4 no one knows shit about anything. It's a probability game.

What's your take.

Runes allows users to mint tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, similar to Ordinals, but with a focus on meme coins. This has led to a surge in activity and fees on the Bitcoin network, as users rush to mint their own tokens. Some believe that early projects and those with catchy ticker names will be the most valuable, while others are still trying to understand the potential of this new technology.

","Despite a brief dip below $60,000 due to pre-Halving jitters and market uncertainty, Bitcoin remains bullish in the long term. The Halving event, historically a positive catalyst for Bitcoin's value, is approaching, and some investors see the recent price correction as a positive sign of leverage being flushed out of the market. Additionally, increased buying of longer-dated call options suggests anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices later this year. Furthermore, the recent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF market in Hong Kong is expected to boost adoption and price.

[Bitcoin 2021: Ross Ulbricht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V_SkLxgQjQ&t=369s)

Are you inspired to do something after watching that? We sure as hell are.

Bitcoin early adopters Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht helped spread the use of Bitcoin when it was less than $10 dollars and someone in this community finally made a coin to help both of them get out of jail and for its holders to make some money. We call that a win-win where I‚Äôm from.

üò≤ Who the heck is Julian Assange?! ü§¶

Julian Assange is the founder of Wikileaks, an international non-profit organization that publishes news leaks and classified media provided by anonymous sources. 

ü§Ø How about Ross Ulbricht?! ü§¶

Ross Ulbricht created the first darknet market, the Silk Road, as an exercise in free market capitalism, a website where users were free to post and buy whatever they felt necessary so long as no party was being harmed. 

These pioneers who have fought for individual freedom, now need our help to be saved from unjust prosecution and sentencing (far reaching government oversight amirite?). 

Join our fight and help raise funds for the legal defenses of Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht. Protect your rights and generate yield at the same time!

Grab a Kleenex and clench your fist in anger as you watch a hero of crypto get treated like crap üò°üò†

[Bitcoin 2021: Ross Ulbricht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V_SkLxgQjQ&t=369s)

Are you inspired to do something after watching that? We sure as hell are.

Bitcoin early adopters Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht helped spread the use of Bitcoin when it was less than $10 dollars and someone in this community finally made a coin to help both of them get out of jail and for its holders to make some money. We call that a win-win where I‚Äôm from.

üò≤ Who the heck is Julian Assange?! ü§¶

Julian Assange is the founder of Wikileaks, an international non-profit organization that publishes news leaks and classified media provided by anonymous sources. 

ü§Ø How about Ross Ulbricht?! ü§¶

Ross Ulbricht created the first darknet market, the Silk Road, as an exercise in free market capitalism, a website where users were free to post and buy whatever they felt necessary so long as no party was being harmed. 

These pioneers who have fought for individual freedom, now need our help to be saved from unjust prosecution and sentencing (far reaching government oversight amirite?). 

Join our fight and help raise funds for the legal defenses of Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht. Protect your rights and generate yield at the same time!

üéá Ad Campaign! üéá

This project launched with NO ICO and is just getting started! We are starting our marketing push in December so get in EARLY!! 

üí∏Shillers will be rewarded too!üí∞

What are the Tokenomics?

‚úÖ Utility! The ‚ÄúFree‚Äù in Freemoon!

5% of every transaction is donated to the legal defenses of Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht. Fight For Freedom! BE A HERO!

üí≤ Autonomous Yield AKA Money for Nothing!üí≤

3% of every transaction is automatically redistributed to existing token holders via reflection.

‚¨áÔ∏è Deflationary SupplyüÜôüí∞

2% of every transaction is put back into the liquidity pool and LP tokens are burned, creating a deflationary supply.

üíçüôå HODL!üíéüôå

Transaction Fee 10%

üîê Liquidity Lock üîê 

For further price stability, Freemoon will use DxLock to restrict 50% of the supply for a duration of 4 years.

* Following the Fed chair‚Äôs comment, traditional markets suffered their worst day in four months.
* Over 98% of analysts predict the FOMC will remain hawkish until May 2024
* While the economy exhibits robust activity levels, experts caution that Powell‚Äôs non-committal stance on future rate hikes might create uncertainty and hinder long-term planning for businesses and investors.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,üåïFreemoon Airdrop News üåï: Bitcoin OGs Julian Assange from Wikileaks and Ross Ulbricht from Silk Road finally have their own token üí∏ and it‚Äôs Airdrop time baby! $50 worth of Freemoon to the first 1000 signups & $10 afterward! (Details Below) üöÄ,"Grab a Kleenex and clench your fist in anger as you watch a hero of crypto get treated like crap üò°üò†

[Bitcoin 2021: Ross Ulbricht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V_SkLxgQjQ&t=369s)

Are you inspired to do something after watching that? We sure as hell are.

Bitcoin early adopters Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht helped spread the use of Bitcoin when it was less than $10 dollars and someone in this community finally made a coin to help both of them get out of jail and for its holders to make some money. We call that a win-win where I‚Äôm from.

üò≤ Who the heck is Julian Assange?! ü§¶

Julian Assange is the founder of Wikileaks, an international non-profit organization that publishes news leaks and classified media provided by anonymous sources. 

ü§Ø How about Ross Ulbricht?! ü§¶

Ross Ulbricht created the first darknet market, the Silk Road, as an exercise in free market capitalism, a website where users were free to post and buy whatever they felt necessary so long as no party was being harmed. 

These pioneers who have fought for individual freedom, now need our help to be saved from unjust prosecution and sentencing (far reaching government oversight amirite?). 

Join our fight and help raise funds for the legal defenses of Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht. Protect your rights and generate yield at the same time!

üéá Ad Campaign! üéá

This project launched with NO ICO and is just getting started! We are starting our marketing push in December so get in EARLY!! 

üí∏Shillers will be rewarded too!üí∞

What are the Tokenomics?

‚úÖ Utility! The ‚ÄúFree‚Äù in Freemoon!

5% of every transaction is donated to the legal defenses of Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht. Fight For Freedom! BE A HERO!

üí≤ Autonomous Yield AKA Money for Nothing!üí≤

3% of every transaction is automatically redistributed to existing token holders via reflection.

‚¨áÔ∏è Deflationary SupplyüÜôüí∞

2% of every transaction is put back into the liquidity pool and LP tokens are burned, creating a deflationary supply.

üíçüôå HODL!üíéüôå

Transaction Fee 10%

üîê Liquidity Lock üîê 

For further price stability, Freemoon will use DxLock to restrict 50% of the supply for a duration of 4 years.

## Whitelist your address by December 31st 2021 to claim your free Freemoon tokens! How much? $50 worth of Freemoon for the first 1000 signups, $10 thereafter!

First why would we give Freemoon away?

We believe Freemoon is about the community coming together for the common cause of helping to free our crypto brothers Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht who are languishing in jail while we enjoy this most recent bullrun.

We hope this Freemoon Airdrop will raise awareness of the two men who are in a big way responsible for crypto's success, and mobilize a movement of people to make a positive change in the world.

# Community Development

Freemoon has set aside 300 Trillion tokens for community development and this is your chance to gain a small percentage of that on the ground level before we launch for the moon.

Early adopters rejoice! History will look back on your crypto addresses with envy! You are the foundation for building this community and making a difference in this world!

# AirDrop Details (Easy as 1 2 3)

This Airdrop is the first of many promotions to show the community and the world we mean business, in the coming weeks we will hold more promotions, however this is your chance to be earlier than the rest of the early adopters!

Here's how:

1. Follow us on: [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/freemoonmain) & Follow us on [**Telegram**](https://t.me/freemooncommunity)
2. Enter [HERE](https://freemoon.io/airdrop.html) on our website and fill out the required information as seen below
3. DON'T FORGET TO CHECK YOUR SUBSCRIPTION!

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Burger King in Paris now accepts Bitcoin and crypto payments,"Burger King has introduced Instpower power bank rental machines that accept cryptocurrency payments at its Paris locations. The machines are connected to crypto payment services Alchemy Pay and Binance Pay.  


I believe that the latest news of Parisian Burger King is a major milestone for both the global fast food giant and the widespread use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment for goods and services.  


Do you think this could spread across other countries as well as other chains of popular fast-food restaurants?  


What I think is that this collaboration with Burger King in Paris has taken us to the next level of how people who are not familiar so much with cryptocurrencies observe them.  


Alongside this news, I've bumped across rumors about a Netflix documentary crew being out there filming something related to [3ST](https://twitter.com/3SToken) but what confuses many is that the T in their name represents a token, could it be a new crypto project, token, or something?   


Anyways, it's cool to know that we will have this crypto payment option in Burger King, I think this will bring close people to understanding crypto.",9,2023-03-30 15:06:14,13

I traded few months on basefex.com, their linkedin [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/company/basefex) (CEO Jesse [Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamjessewu) and Head of Global Operations [Randolf G](https://www.linkedin.com/in/randolf-g-21128128)), one day (29.06.2019) I made 3 BTC from 0.3 BTC, tried to withdraw 2.7 BTC. my request was rejected.

Then I asked in their telegram group a question about this situation. My message was deleted and account removed from their chat. Few hours later I tried to do this from another telegram account -- result was he same. OK. I decided to give them a day to think, because it was Sunday.

Next day I see messages in chat about another person in the same situation (with 7 btc banned), I joined with 3rd telegram acc and asked the same question about my 3 BTC. Questions were even answered (funds are safu) by **Randolf Zhao**. but 1 hour later everything was deleted.

Later I wrote to **Randolf Zhao,** he spoke with me and told me again about investigation. But few minutes later he stopped answering my questions and deleted all messages and blocked me

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Here are 3 metrics to analyze the market without looking at the price of BTC,"Hey, 

ever noticed how BTC at $63k can feel totally different from one week to the next?

Now you might wonder why.

Sure, market sentiment is a big factor, but there‚Äôs more to it.

Think about this: When BTC was at $16k in 2017, everyone was euphoric.

Fast-forward to 2022, and BTC hits $16k again, and suddenly, everyone's in despair.

Even though the price was the same, the onchain metrics painted a vastly different picture.

In 2017 they were overheated and in 2022 they were oversold.

The biggest mistake most investors make is that they never look at onchain metrics.

**That‚Äôs why I will share my top 3 on-chain metrics with you so that you can identify the best time to sell near the peak.**

The three metrics can help you time the market without needing to look at the price of BTC are:

- **MVRV**
- **NUPL**
- **Puell Multiple**

## Let‚Äôs start with MVRV

**1Ô∏è‚É£ MVRV (Market value realized value)**

This metric measures whether Bitcoin is overvalued compared to its historical average.

If MVRV exceeds 2, it indicates that the current price is much higher than what most holders paid, suggesting that we are moving towards the peak.

However, keep in mind the MVRV has exceeded 4.0 in 2021 which shows it can go much higher than expected.

You can look at the current BTC MVRV value [here](#).

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ NUPL (Net unrealized profits and loss)

NUPL identifies the overall market sentiment by showing the proportion of Bitcoin holdings in profit or loss.

A NUPL value in the ""greed"" zone (above 0.7) is very strongly correlated with market tops.

The higher it goes the stronger the sell signal.

You can look at the current NUPL value [here](#).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Puell Multiple

This onchain metric compares the daily earnings of Bitcoin miners against the average over the past year. 

View the Puell Multiple chart [here](#).

**Here‚Äôs how to use the Puell Multiple:**

Puell Multiple > 2.5 = You should sell up to 25%+ of your BTC/alts on upward moves. This will give you a lot of capital to buy back during capitulation events.

Puell Multiple > 5 = You should be selling 75%+ of your BTC portfolio. Furthermore, you must set sell orders for your altcoins, as they often pump after BTC pumps.

Grouper Swap BTC/LTC/DOGE:GROUPER: [grouper.website/?page\_id=2201](https://grouper.website/?page_id=2201)

Why is it named Grouper? Because there are three lotteries grouped into one!

\--- What is it? ----

The Grouper Token is a perpetual lottery token hosted on the Binance Smart Chain. There are hourly, daily, and weekly Lottery draws. The amount of Grouper tokens needed to play will be determined by the cost of the coin and overall total holders. All you must do is have at least the minimum amount to automatically be entered into all the lotteries. 176 Lotteries A Week

Current Min Tokens to Be Entered in Lotteries: 50,000 Grouper

BSC Contract Address: 0x9ce5222a0419cc4d25ece978aaa5d8c31b3565e6

\--- How do I make money? ---

1. Buy the minimums to play lottery and enjoy community
2. Buy more, become an owner, help steer the project and eventually sell back your tokens to those trying to join at a much higher price + play all the lotteries.

\--- Why is it different? ---

The supply of Grouper is elastic. You have deflationary pressure when Grouper is traded as there is a 6% tax on every transaction. 5% that is burned, along with the 1% advertising fee (6% total). This helps to reduce supply while also discouraging high speed bots from buying and selling around the lottery times. The Grouper contract is fully published for everyone to read unlike many other lottery tokens on the Binance Smart Chain.

\--- How can they guarantee winners? --- (THIS SOLVES PROBLEM 1)

Minting coins is not evil, as long as it is explained upfront. To ensure timely lotteries the coins are minted. Hence if transaction volume is low this might cause slight inflation. The max coins awarded per week is equal to 1.5% of the total available coins. The 5% transfer tax easily counteracts this over time.

Many other bsc lotteries die because their volume trails off and they cannot pay lotteries!

\--- What the heck is GROUPER Swap? --- (SOLVES PROBLEM 2)

Grouper swap allows newer members to bsc to buy in directly with Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Doge coin. (More coins added soon). This allows them to skip pancake swap and all the headaches of converting to bnb and then to the GROUPER lottery token. Imagine when the Doge boys figure out they can join a lottery join FOR LIFE for 50 Doge.

\--- Simplicity --- (SOLVES PROBLEM 3)

Buy, hold, and win. It is literally that simple. If your wallet holds the minimum amount you are eligible to play all 176 weekly GROUPER lotteries! The minimum amount needed will NEVER go up, only down as the market cap increases. The dev‚Äôs are aiming to peg it at a $25 entry per wallet. So, if you buy more coins make sure to split them into separate wallets so you get more chances to win. (Metamask works great for this). The devs are also working on the website so you will be notified by email, telegram, and TEXT MESSAGE if you win! The weekly lottery is obviously the largest draw, but it is super fun being able to watch all the hourly winners in the chat get excited!

\--- Published Contract ---

Grouper contract is fully published and the devs answer any questions about it. Please support open source and only contribute to bsc projects that fully publish their contracts!

\--- What are the tokenomics? ---

The supply of Grouper is elastic. You have deflationary pressure when Grouper is traded as there is a 6% tax on every transaction. 5% that is burned, along with the 1% advertising fee (6% total). This helps to reduce supply while also discouraging high speed bots from buying and selling around the lottery times. The Grouper contract is fully published for everyone to read unlike many other lottery tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. The overall 5% burn results in deflationary pressure. Fair rules, published contract, and fair randomization.

\--- Can you increase your odds? ---

If I have more Grouper does it increase my chances? No, each wallet has the same chance to win. You can split your wallet into several smaller wallets for better chances as long as they hold the minimum.

\--- Liquidity lock? Presale? ---

The Grouper presale was 5/30/21 and sold. Liquidity locked until 2022.

\--- How do I trust GROUPER? ---

Functions allow you to interact directly with GROUPER on the blockchain!

Trust but verify, all GROUPER information can be verified directly on the black chain. Examples include last winner, when the next jackpot is, and how many current holders there are.

\--- Is there a roadmap? ---

\- Upcoming Mobile App

\- Text Notifications If You Win

\- Expanded Website Integration

\- Influencer Affiliate Program

\- Ethereum 2 Upgrades

\--- Are you still reading? ---

If you are still reading, I hope you enjoyed learning a little bit about the Grouper project. I got my bags and am waiting for takeoff. I believe the facts presented above clearly explain why Grouper will be here for the long run and outpace all the bsc and crypto lotteries.

Grouper is not trying to be the best bsc lottery‚Ä¶ They are trying to be the best CRYPTO lottery!",419,2021-06-11 19:03:32,8

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Miners DeFi Coin - MINERS just got major PR In Yahoo News about to go Parabolic I Legit Coin backed by over 115 K in Real BTC Mining Hardware Asics I Insane potential,"I normally trade larger MC coins or invest directly in startups, but every once in a while I come across a real gem in the micro cap space. I wanted to share with all of you in this sub, because I‚Äôve learned so much from this place and hope I can make a real difference in someone‚Äôs life by sharing this alpha. 

$MINERS is a token that pools money to fund cutting-edge Bitcoin mining and pays out BTC rewards to every holder. They already have a mining facility set up with hydropower in Siberia. The founder is a massive influencer and flew to Siberia himself to finalize the partnership setup and film the facilities.

A portion of the tax goes to a mining wallet which then gets used to buy mining hardware. They did a soft launch back in September and acquired over 115K of mining hardware already which is generating a continuous income stream for the coin and its holder. They just completed a massive rebrand process, started major PR (google Miners DeFi and you‚Äôll see) and are about to kick their marketing into high gear. The team has plans to launch an updated live mining dashboard, an NFT platform, a game and a DAO to give the community more control over the token.

We‚Äôre getting in super early so this is SUCH a good bet. Every single coin founded by an influencer has skyrocketed. I hear that they have a massive marketing plan with YouTube videos scheduled for every single day, and they retained a major PR agency called Interdependence. Also, they‚Äôre already starting to go viral on Twitter. This is insane. MC right now is ridiculously low at around 1M and ATH of 5M, this is a really good opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a serious project. 

**Tokenomics**

&#x200B;

* 13% transaction tax
   * 4% to mining wallet, which will be returned tenfold to holders after profits
   * 4% reflections/rewards in BTC, meaning all holders will be receiving a passive income!
   * 2% to LP, increasing the stability and value of the coin with each transaction (LP is already super high - normally i‚Äôd think this is low but in the case of $MINERS it works!)
   * 2% to Marketing to provide a stable budget for marketing expenses
* 1 quadrillion total supply -- 50% burned immediately! And constant burns--the coin is hyper-deflationary.
* 20% was sold through the presale, 20% Pancakeswap V2 listing
* &#x200B;

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Will BTC ditch the bear market?,"BTC enters the last week of March in the uncertain territory as a strong weekly close still keeps $30,000 out of reach.   
 

It managed to close out the week with a modest flourish, returning to the $28,000 mark, but it also seems that BTC stayed practically unmoved versus the weekend prior, delivering some impressive stability despite the periods of volatility, which occurred in the intervening period.   
 

Another possibility as I've seen that someone tweeted is that ‚ÄúIf BTC continues to struggle to break beyond $28,700 then a healthy dip may need to occur to gain fresh buyer interest at lower levels,‚Äù    
 

I found info as well that the latest data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode shows that the amount of the available BTC supply, which has not left its wallet in two years or longer, is now at all-time highs.   
 

For some, BTC price action is right on track for repeating past cycles and setting a new all-time high in the process.   
 

At this point, I really don't know what to think or what to expect, I noticed because all of this what's happening I got more into GameFi to make myself calmer I guess, I started investing in CFAN since I play a lot of Coin Fantasy these days, I believe that metaverse tokens could be a good investment as well, we will see anyway, time will tell.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Whales begin transferring BTC indicating a potential rise.,"Popular crypto tracking service Whale Alert, which traces big crypto transactions, has shared that just recently, four consecutive transactions shifted a whopping 47,846 Bitcoins in four lumps.    


In the meantime, a recent Santiment report shows that Bitcoin has been showing signs of a price revival, and the Bitcoin hash rate has reached another all-time high, despite the price staying low. Image via Twitter Whales move nearly $1 billion in BTC, Bitcoin shows signs of reversal Nearly 48,000 BTC were shifted in four transactions ‚Äî three of them carrying nearly 13,000 BTC each. In total, these four transfers were evaluated at $939.8 million. All of the transactions were sent from different wallets to different addresses, with not a single address being used more than once.   


It seems that the whales have been redistributing their holdings. Ads Meanwhile, a recent report published by Santiment data aggregator shows that the long-term metrics of Bitcoin have been demonstrating signs of a reverse for several months already, even though the price remains at the lows.  


It seems BTC finally decided to join the ranks of Blockchain finance (Ovenue, RealIt etc) and GameFi and lead crypto forward.  


The indicators that are showing signs positive for Bitcoin are MDIA (no distribution of BTC has been occurring for a long time now) and MVRV, social volume and weighted sentiment, and network-realized-profit-loss (NRPL).",8,2022-10-18 18:03:58,13
BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,People holding BTC for 5 years are at a 34 percent loss.,"The bears have won most of this year‚Äôs crypto market as the most popular crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), struggles to cross the $20k price point. According to the market intelligence platform, Santiment, five-year BTC investors are now at a loss.  


Santiment shared a chart with the crypto community proclaiming that people who have been holding Bitcoin for the last five years are now underwater, with a 34% loss on average. The analytic firm added that BTC return first went 0% on June 9 this year.   


Currently, BTC trades at around the $16k price range after briefly hitting $18,000 over the previous 48 hours. Additionally, according to data from the market tracking site, CoinMarketCap,  the global crypto market cap lost nearly $22 billion in the last 24 hours.  


Of the top ten cryptocurrencies with the largest market cap, the Binance coin (BNB) and the meme Dogecoin (DOGE) have been the worst hit under the seven-day window. The meme token experienced a not-so-surprising 20% loss in the last seven days and a 7% loss in 24 hours.  


However, BNB trades at $236.49, falling from nearly $300, representing a whopping 18% loss, given that BNB is one of the top tokens with great utility and community. The week-long depreciation may be due to the continuous FUD and panic calls circulating the crypto community.   


GameFi (Axie, God's Infinity, and new projects like CosmoGene and  LifeBeyond), DeFi seem to be holding on which is amazing however BTC is still struggling and this just confirms it.  


This week, Binance suffered significant FUD messages that led to massive withdrawals of over $6 billion within 24 hours from the exchange. The crypto community praised Binance for handling the influx without failing.",16,2022-12-18 01:23:22,9

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Could BTC reach 22k?,"Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD holding firm above $21,000 on the day.  


The pair remained cool amid news from Japan, where the central bank ‚Äî the Bank of Japan (BoJ) ‚Äî had decided to keep an ultra-easy policy in place, defying expectations of an interest rate hike.  


In doing so, both the Japanese yen and the United States dollar took a hit in the latest chapter of a saga closely watched by crypto commentators.  


‚ÄúIn keeping its key rate and yield curve control policy unchanged at today‚Äôs meeting, the Bank of Japan probably wanted to convey a message to the market; don‚Äôt fight the BoJ,‚Äú ING Bank said in a dedicated response piece.  


Cointelegraph contributor Micha√´l van de Poppe focused on a fresh decline in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) following the news.  


‚ÄúAnother bearish retest taking place on the DXY, in which this one starts to drop substantially, maybe even due to the announcements from the BoJ earlier today,‚Äù he summarized.  


In the event, DXY bounced at 101.9, not quite retesting the seven-month lows achieved on Jan. 16.  


Van de Poppe also noted upcoming data from the U.S. in the form of the Producer Price Index (PPI) for December 2022  


BTC has up and down during this crisis along with the rest of crypto, although some of it like GameFi led by projects like Alien Worlds, CosmoGene, LifeBeyond has been successful, let's just hope BTC could catch up.  


On Bitcoin markets, meanwhile, suspicion continued to swirl around activity on the Binance order book as large-volume traders posted more and more bid liquidity.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,BTC ETF Possible Downsides?,"Hi, i have read this article regarding some downsides that could affetc BTC if an ETF will be released by BlackRock and other Assets Managements Institutions [https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etfs-even-worse-for-crypto-than-central-exchanges](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etfs-even-worse-for-crypto-than-central-exchanges). 

I am curious to know what are your thoughts about this statement present in the article

&#x200B;

>There are also other dangers for the wider market. With ETFs, there  is a risk that ‚Äúpaper Bitcoin,‚Äù or claims not backed by actual Bitcoin,  could distort the market and undermine Bitcoin‚Äôs very monetary policy.  Exchanges that have issued paper Bitcoin in the past ‚Äî such as FTX ‚Äî  have been kept in check via withdrawal runs and eventual collapse, after  which the fake Bitcoin claims were wiped out along with the hapless  exchanges.  
>  
>**That likely wouldn‚Äôt be the case with ETFs. Without the  possibility of withdrawing the underlying asset, paper Bitcoin can be  printed at will. If Bitcoin ETFs become the dominant way of investing in  Bitcoin, it could very well lead to millions of paper Bitcoin flooding  the market, suppressing the price of Bitcoin.**

&#x200B;

Apart from the fact that purchasing ETF will not give you the ability to own any BTC so basically you will not have all the advantages offered by the BTC Blockchain iteself, is there any chance that flooding of BTC papers from BTC ETF could reduce considerably the BTC price or distort the BTC price?

I am asking this because apparently that didn't happen after 28 Marh of 2003 when the first Gold ETF was opened",1,2023-07-06 14:24:06,0
BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Is the BTC surge imminent?,"On the daily timeframe, the price seems to be closing in on finally disrupting the consolidation of the last few weeks, as the 50-day moving average is being tested once more around the $16,800 mark.  


In case of a valid bullish breakout, there would be little resistance in the way, and a rise toward the $18K resistance level would be imminent. A breakout from this significant resistance level would likely lead to a breach above the large falling wedge pattern, which could lead to a bullish market structure in the mid-term.  


However, as the price is yet to successfully climb above the 50-day moving average, there is still a considerable chance for rejection, which could result in a drop toward the $15K support level.  


Things appear trickier on the 4-hour timeframe, as the price action has been showing signs of rejection from the $16,800 level.  


GameFi (Uplands, Alien Worlds, and new projects like CosmoGene and  LifeBeyond), and Blockchain finance are doing fine however BTC is still failing to recover completely and we will see what the future holds.  


The RSI indicator should also be monitored closely as it is approaching the overbought zone of above 70%, a signal which could hint at rejection and a bearish reversal. In this case, the price could increase toward the $15,500 support area.  


Still, it would be too soon to call it a bearish move, as the price is ranging near the resistance level and could showcase an impulsive break above it later in the day.  


To summarize, the market is in a very crucial area, so the next few days, and potentially even hours, would likely decide the short-term trend based on the price‚Äôs reaction to the $16,800 area.",10,2023-01-04 17:05:46,7

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"BTC, ETH, and BNB | Market Analysis","Today we will be looking at BTC, ETH, and BNB ‚Äì the three largest non-stable assets listed on the Midas platform. Currently, BTC is trading at $19.5k, ETH at $1.33k, and BNB at $274. All three assets are virtually flat over the past 7 days after a volatile week of trading. So what comes next for the crypto market? 

## Bitcoin Price Analysis

First we will take a look at BTC‚Äôs 4H candle chart to get an idea of short-term price movements. In the chart shown above, we see BTC‚Äôs 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMA). The 100SMA has actually crossed above the 200SMA ‚Äì signaling that the market is currently in a ‚Äúneutral‚Äù mode and has shifted out of bearish territory. Confirming this is a clear bullish divergence ‚Äì BTC has broken above all moving averages and is currently trading above $19.5k. 

BTC briefly broke above these averages last week but was quickly rejected. If the price manages to hold above these lines (close a candle above), it would confirm this bullish divergence. The 200SMA should act as support at $19.4k. Resistance is at prior rejection zones of $19.8k, and $20.4k.

Looking at BTC‚Äôs daily candle chart, the moving averages are still in a bearish configuration. However, BTC is facing a key test here of the 50SMA. If BTC can break through local resistance at $19.7k and hold, it will be poised to test the 100SMA resistance at $21k. The daily 200SMA resistance is much higher at $26k.

Looking at BTC‚Äôs daily momentum, it seems likely that BTC will test and break $19.7k. The RSI is neutral, and Stochastic has bottomed and is reversing from an oversold position. BTC could see a rally in the coming weeks.

BTC continues to look indecisive on the weekly. The RSI is oversold, but Stochastic has been hovering near the overbought line. BTC continues to range below its weekly 200SMA, which will act as an important resistance zone, now priced at $23.7k. The most likely scenario for the coming months is consolidation. 

## Ethereum Price Analysis

Ethereum‚Äôs 4H chart and moving averages are still in a bearish configuration, however there is bullish divergence as the price has broken above the 50 and 100 SMA‚Äôs to test the 200. The 200 will act as key resistance at $1350. This is a definite shift for ETH as the 100SMA has acted as resistance throughout the past few weeks. The 100 and 200 SMA can act as support now, around $1300. 

Ethereum‚Äôs daily chart and momentum are still bearish, but the RSI and Stochastic are currently bouncing from near-oversold levels. ETH could test its closest resistance ‚Äì the daily 50SMA ‚Äì priced at $1429. This has acted as resistance since September. 

ETH has shown relative strength compared to BTC throughout the bear market, as it has held above its 200w SMA. The RSI is oversold, and Stochastic has been trending down as ETH consolidates and grinds upward. This sets up ETH to test higher resistances. ETH is likely to hold above $1300 as this is major support at the 200w SMA. 

## BNB Price Analysis

Despite recently forming a death cross pattern on the 4H, BNB has some bullish divergence on this low-timeframe chart. BNB has recently broken above the 50sMA and held it as support on a backtest, cementing it as a support zone. This support is at $272. Resistance is higher ‚Äì priced around $280. 

On BNB‚Äôs daily chart, it also looks poised to test 50SMA resistance around $280. This comes as BNB‚Äôs RSI is neutral and stochastic is about to bounce. BNB could get some good momentum going if it crosses the $280 and holds above that range. 

Similar to ETH, BNB has shown relative strength compared to BTC and has held above its weekly 200SMA nicely throughout the bear market. Its RSI is close to neutral (slightly oversold) and Stochastic has been grinding down as BNB consolidates. A rising price floor is bullish for BNB. Major support at its 200SMA is priced at $180, but it‚Äôs unlikely to go that low in the coming months. The resistance to break is at $350 ‚Äì a local high set in August. 

## Market Sentiment

Despite the upward price movement and bullish divergence across the charts, crypto markets remain overly fearful. This drastically lowers the likelihood of a major price dump.

## Conclusion

Charts are beginning to show bullish divergence and a move from bearish to neutrality. Market sentiment is lagging ‚Äì still overly fearful. It is likely that we are entering a sideways market. There will still be ups and downs, but potentially the bottom is in for BTC, ETH, and BNB alike.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Celsius converts thousands of BTC,"Celsius converted 22,962.8 WBTC into bitcoin on Feb. 28.

The transaction occurred with the consent of the Celsius creditor committee, according to a filing in the lender's Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection proceedings on March 3.

No reason was given as to why the exchange occurred. Wrapped bitcoin, or WBTC, is an ERC-2o token interoperable with the Ethereum blockchain.

One of a number of crypto lenders to fall afoul of the bear market, Celsius entered into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in July, when it revealed a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet. Since then, it's been working through a restructuring process and figuring out how to pay creditors and things have gone well since.  Crypto asset management platforms like Celsius has done relatively well in spite of the crisis but they are far from FlyntFinance and Pantera.

Last month, it put forward plans for a sale to NovaWulf  Digital Management, an investment firm founded in 2021 by former Wall Street dealmakers. Those plans were supported by the Celsius creditor committee earlier this week.",6,2023-03-07 13:10:17,4

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Do you think that's possible that ETH would someday have a bigger market than BTC?,"A few months ago, financial juggernaut Morgan Stanley projected that ETH would someday have a bigger market than BTC. What do you think of that?  


If you've worked with ETH for a while, even when its value wasn't quite as high as it is now, it's interesting to read something like this. Has anyone used the amazing trading software Fasset before? I just started using it and spending time on it.  


How recently did you purchase cryptocurrencies, and which trading platform do you actually use?  


People have a solid understanding of cryptocurrencies and seem to have developed a near-overnight fascination with them. I remember when I first discovered it, I had no idea what I was doing, and even when I did, the sheer amount of cryptocurrencies that are out there baffled me.  


Have you made any previous investments before beginning to invest in cryptocurrencies? Despite never making an investment, I've heard that many people have developed a strong interest in cryptocurrencies.  


Does that imply that cryptocurrencies received a lot of hype for whatever reason or that people only learned about cryptocurrency as a result of all the talk?",6,2022-10-07 09:40:16,9
BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,BTC fails to break the 21k barrier.,"BTC futures and stablecoin margin data shows a lack of appetite from buyers even as Bitcoin gained 7.5% in a week.  


BTC rallied on the back of the United States stock market‚Äôs 3.4% gains on Oct. 28, with the S&P 500 index rising to its highest level in 44 days. In addition, recently released data showed that inflation might be slowing down, which gave investors hope that the Federal Reserve might break its pattern of 75 basis-point rate hikes after its November meeting.  


In September, the U.S. core personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.5% from the previous month. Although still an increase, it was in line with expectations. This data is the Federal Reserve‚Äôs primary inflation measure for interest rate modeling.  


Apart from Gamefi (led by CosmoGene, Axie, and new projects like LifeBeyond), XRP, and Blockchain finance projects crypto is still in winter and I am certain BTC will recover as soon as this is all over.  


Additional positive news came from tech giant Apple, which reported weak iPhone revenues on Oct. 27 but beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly earnings and margin. Moreover, Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri said services would grow year-over-year in the fourth quarter.",6,2022-10-31 23:39:18,8
BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"What is BTC closer to, 8k or 22k?","Currently, down 15% in Q4 and over 60% year-to-date, BTC/USD has few bullish allies as 2023 looms.

Struggling to recover from the ongoing FTX scandal and the associated fallout, the largest cryptocurrency giving back all the gains seen since late 2020 is indicative of the crypto market as a whole.

Risk assets are in a precious position themselves, as Cointelegraph reported, while eyes are also on the strength of the U.S. dollar going into the new year.

All of the crypto is in a horrible situation with some exceptions like GameFi (Axie, CosmoGene, LifeBeyond, etc) that has actually somehow managed to stay afloat and DeFi (although persistent hacking issues have made life difficult for them) and BTC is not the exception

Some popular traders had different opinions when it comes to what BTC price action could do in Q1, 2023.

One market participant taking no chances on the last day of trading on Wall Street is Crypto Tony.

Having warned that a trip to as low as $8,000 could be imminent for Bitcoin, on Dec. 30, a fresh chart showed just how weak price action currently is.

On daily timeframes, BTC/USD is back below the equilibrium price (EQ) of a range in place since FTX began, this no longer holding as support.

A failed breakout at the range high means that the most likely target is now the range low at closer to $15,500.

‚ÄúI remain short and am looking for the push down into the range low as highlighted,‚Äù Crypto Tony wrote in accompanying comments.

For fellow trader Cred, it is also all about the range when it comes to how Bitcoin might behave in the future.

In a video update on Dec. 29, Cred identified monthly and weekly support at $14,000 and $12,000, respectively.

‚ÄúWith that said, if we‚Äôre not at these levels, what can we look for? If you don‚Äôt want to get to support, you could always show me a failed breakdown from support as a bullish argument,‚Äù he said.

An area around $18-19,000, broken through thanks to FTX in November, could thus still become a target to reclaim, leaving subsequent weeks‚Äô price action as such a ‚Äúfailed breakdown.‚Äù

On weekly timeframes, however, BTC/USD is currently trading in an insignificant zone which is ‚Äúnot anywhere,‚Äù Cred added.",7,2022-12-31 00:40:47,5
BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Bitcoin addresses holding 1 BTC or more reach one million: Glassnode,,1,2023-05-15 16:27:39,0
BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"BTC, ETH, and BNB | Market Technical Analysis","It‚Äôs been crypto‚Äôs worst week since mid-June amid the fallout of FTX‚Äôs insolvency and the resulting contagion that is now spreading through the industry. BTC has dumped mercilessly to a new market low of $15.8k, falling through all support levels as fear moved to extreme levels.

# Bitcoin Price Analysis

On BTC‚Äôs first plunge down, it bottomed as the RSI hit extreme oversold levels. There is also a clear double-bottom pattern on the chart above. However, BTC‚Äôs RSI has been trending upward even though the price is sideways ‚Äì meaning room is clearing for BTC to dip further. Local support is at the double bottom, priced at $15.8k. Resistance is now around the $17k mark.¬†

It‚Äôs a similar story on nearly all timeframes for BTC. Bearish price action and oversold momentum indicators. Here the RSI is up slightly but is still near oversold, and Stochastic is at the bottom of its range. This means that some sideways consolidation at this new price level is likely.¬†

BTC is trading at its lowest level in over two years. Currently, resistance on the weekly is the prior low of $17.6k hit in June. The RSI is sitting near oversold, but Stochastic is on its way down ‚Äì indicating either further downside or a long period of consolidation at this price level. Lower supports are at $13-14k where BTC hit resistance in June of 2019 (more than three years ago).¬†

# Ethereum Price Analysis

ETH rejected off its daily 200SMA last week ‚Äì leading to a bearish sell-off. After bouncing with an oversold RSI, ETH has been consolidating in the same zone that it was throughout most of October ($1200-1300). ETH is showing strength relative to BTC, which is at its lowest point in years.¬† ¬†

ETH‚Äôs RSI has been flat, and Stochastic is trending down ‚Äì a symptom of sideways consolidation. We can see that ETH just closed a candle beneath its weekly 200SMA. This will be an important resistance for ETH to recover-¬† priced at $1330. In this chart, we can see that ETH is trading well above its summer lows of around $850 ‚Äì further indicating its strength relative to the rest of the market.¬†

ETH‚Äôs relative strength can be attributed to its radical shift in emissions. In the 60 days since the merge, ETH‚Äôs total supply has actually decreased by over 5700 ETH. While this may not sound like much, the old emission model would have added over 700k new ETH in the same time period. This is over $1B worth of ETH that has not hit the market in the last 60 days ‚Äì a massive decrease in selling pressure.¬†

# BNB Price Analysis

It‚Äôs been an even more turbulent week for BNB, as CZ is near the heart of the crypto drama. BNB traded as high as $360 and has declined back to its October consolidation zone around $270 ‚Äì also showing relative strength in the market. Its RSI is nearing oversold and Stochastic is near the bottom of its range ‚Äì indicating that it has bottomed out in the short-term. Support is at $270, and resistance is at the 50SMA ($290).

There is some bearish divergence on BNB‚Äôs weekly chart as it rejected off the 50SMA last week. This level remains a major resistance zone at $345. Both of BNB‚Äôs weekly momentum indicators are neutral as it continues to grind sideways. Support is at its summer low around $180.¬†

# Market Sentiment

Sentiment has swung back to ‚ÄúExtreme Fear‚Äù but a level of 24 does not capture the extremely fearful sentiment on crypto social media. With investors acting as if crypto has died completely thanks to SBF, scaling into positions at these levels seems like a good r:r.

# Conclusion

It‚Äôs been a shocking week, and the insolvency/bankruptcy of FTX is perhaps the most difficult for the industry since Mt. Gox. It is impossible to say for sure if the bottom is in, but BTC is trading near levels that would historically indicate the end of the bear market is close. It could go as low as $13-14k, but those supports seem strong and holders‚Äô resolve is also strong. The biggest unknown right now is how deep the FTX contagion goes ‚Äì however, CZ‚Äôs message that Binance will help projects in a liquidity crunch brings a glimmer of hope. Trade extremely cautiously during this time.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Finance platforms are rolling past ETH and BTC.,"At the forefront of the crypto market recovery have been major blockchain financial coins, boasting double-digit gains over the past month, outperforming top cryptocurrencies like BTC and Ether ETH, according to CoinMarketCap data.  


Cryptocurrency lending platform Aave's native asset, AAVE, rose 12.68% to $109.73. Fantom (FTM) also posted double-digit gains, up 13.82% to $0.41. This follows in part after Binance launched FTM Locked Staking with up to 18.70% user rewards.  


It is obvious that people are paying more and more attention to and trusting blockchain financial platforms like Algorand, Ovenue, Aavalone, which deal with different fields of finance, real estate, and investment, which leads to other blockchain companies to follow.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,In the midst of a pullback? | BTC Price Analysis,"BTC has been tracking with the global economy which has been improving since June. However, China unexpectedly cut rates last night ‚Äì sending markets a clear signal that economic recovery may not be as sturdy as markets would lead you to believe. This sent commodities pricing, and BTC, falling overnight. Glassnode data shows that BTC‚Äôs hashrate has been in decline over recent months, but a 30 day moving average could signal that the network is stabilizing at these levels. 

BTC is in the midst of a pullback. In the short term, $23.6-24k support seems likely to hold, as indicators on the 4H show the stochastic in an oversold position. The daily chart seems to be rejecting off the 100 SMA, suggesting that further consolidation and possibly a retrace to 50SMA support could be necessary. The weekly chart is beginning to look shaky as the stochastic is reaching overbought levels, but RSI remains near oversold. If BTC makes a convincing close below the 200w sma, we could see a violent dump that resets our long term momentum indicators.

Let‚Äôs look at the [charts](https://t.me/midas_announcements/783) to get into more detail.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Is BTC going downwards from this point?,"Bitcoin has been unable to break through the $47,000 resistance level, and despite the market's recent slide below $44,000 on April 6, there is still accumulating evidence that the market structure is healthy.

Bitcoin had a 25.6 percent decline in December, that lasted 18 hours and ended with a low of $42,360. The price remained 18 percent below $56,650 four months later.

From my perspective, much has changed in that time, and there is clear evidence from other parts of the industry. MicroStrategy disclosed the purchase of 4,197 Bitcoin between February 15 and April 2, 2022.

According to Glassnode statistics, inflows to Canadian Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also reached an all-time high. Since January, these Canadian investment vehicles have raised their holdings by 6,594 BTC, bringing their total to 69,052 BTC under control, a new record. A spot instrument, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, now has $1.68 billion in assets.

I'm not sure how BTC will react at this price, but my BEAN and BUSD balances are very close to nothing. However, you should always do your own research. What are your opinions on the matter?",10,2022-04-06 20:10:04,11
BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"BTC, ETH, and BNB | Market Technical Analysis","**Bitcoin Price Analysis**

There is some clear bullish divergence on the 4H chart. BTC‚Äôs 50SMA has crossed over the 100 ‚Äì officially entering neutral territory. This is confirmed by BTC riding above both 50 and 100 SMA‚Äôs. BTC also crossed over the 200SMA resistance at $17.1k ‚Äì a major breakout point if it can hold. This is the first time BTC has risen above the 200SMA since before the FTX crash in November.¬†

On the daily chart, BTC is still sitting below its moving averages ‚Äì which remain in a bearish configuration. The RSI is now sitting in a neutral range, but Stochastic is overbought. The nearest resistance is the $18.1k zone. With the stochastic being overbought, BTC will likely retrace to support levels in the medium term.¬†

Support at the previous consolidation zone is around the $16-16.2k mark.

**Ethereum Price Analysis**

On ETH‚Äôs 4H chart, we can see a similar situation to BTC. The 50 and 100 SMA lines were acting as support, which confirmed on multiple retests over the past few days. Today ETH broke through the 200SMA resistance, and a golden cross opportunity is setting up for the coming week. ETH needs to hold above $1260 resistance.

On the long term ETH chart, ETH has held up very well. The RSI is approaching neutral, but Stochastic is bouncing from oversold. This indicates that an upward grind and/or sideways consolidation is likely. ETH is trading just under the 200w SMA at $1350, which is an important resistance zone.¬†

**BNB Price Analysis**

BNB has been trading along its moving averages quite nicely. We can see that after last week‚Äôs pump, BNB has fallen below all three moving averages and is confirming them as resistance on this low timeframe.The closest resistance is the 50SMA, which is priced at $291. If BNB fails to break above and hold this level, it likely retraces to previous consolidation zones in the $270 range.¬†

On BNB‚Äôs long term chart, we can see that it has held up incredibly well compared to the rest of the market and is up significantly from its summer lows. The 50SMA crossed below the 100, signaling neutral price action, and is acting as strong resistance around the $330 mark. Long term support is at the 200w SMA ‚Äì which is still rising in the bear market ‚Äì priced at $191. Local support is at the $260 consolidation zone.¬†

**Market Sentiment**

Despite the upward move last week, investor sentiment is still at an extreme fear. This signals that it remains a good time to DCA into long term positions.

**Conclusion**

While the worst of the crypto winter is likely over, it will take some time for the machine to kick back into gear. Sideways consolidation and market chop is the most likely scenario for the next several months as the market recovers and normalizes. BTC and ETH have strong supports underneath them, but also strong resistance headwinds not far above. The declining hash rate signifies that miner capitulation has already occurred to some extent and is likely priced in. BTC would need to move much lower or stay in this price range for significantly longer in order to force more capitulation. The low sentiment and near-bottom prices make this a good time to build long term bags.¬†

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"BTC has rate jumps 17 percent for a brief period, the second biggest jump this year.","Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) hash rate surged 17% to an all-time high of 361.28EH/s on Jan. 6 from around 233 EH/s recorded on the same day ‚Äî the second biggest one-day increase in the past year.

It has since retraced to 269.56 EH/s, as of press time.

Over the past week, data shows that Foundry USA contributed 29.08% of the total hash rate, followed by Antpool‚Äôs 20.38% and F2Pool with 16.12%.

MacroMicro also suggested that the average cost of mining BTC was greater than the asset‚Äôs spot price. According to the data, BTC‚Äôs average mining cost as of Jan. 7 was $19,230.

Since BTC‚Äôs hash rate Christmas decline, the network has added 50th/s. During the festive period, the hash rate plunged by around 40% amid poor weather conditions that forced major miners to shut operations.

Meanwhile, BTC‚Äôs hash rate uptick is expected to lead to a 7% to 10% increase in mining difficulty.

BTC has been on an up and down curve during this crisis along with the rest of crypto, although some of it like GameFi led by projects like Alien Worlds, CosmoGene, and LifeBeyond has been successful, let's just hope BTC could catch up.

BTC‚Äôs mining difficulty is currently at 34.09T. The estimated increase will see the mining difficulty rise to between 36.6T and 37.7T, according to bitrawr.",9,2023-01-10 01:53:36,1
BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Famous crypto analyst predicts a BTC turnaround.,"Widely followed cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is expressing a bullish outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) over the coming months.  


Cowen tells his 778,000 YouTube subscribers in a new video that Bitcoin could start a bullish reversal later next year ahead of the flagship crypto asset‚Äôs scheduled halving in 2024 and the possible loosening of monetary policies by the Federal Reserve.  


‚ÄúMy guess again is I think things will slowly start to turn around and go to neutral sometime in 2023.  


And then as you get later into 2023, I imagine we‚Äôll start to see some bullish signs as the halving will be inside and getting back to probably a more dovish Fed.‚Äù  


According to the crypto strategist, this is the second-longest bear market in the history of Bitcoin. However, Cowen says that this will be Bitcoin‚Äôs longest bear market in a couple of days if the flagship digital asset plunges below the two-year low of about $15,476.  


‚ÄúIt remains only the second-longest bear market so far because there was one bear market back from November of 2013 to January of 2015 that actually lasted 406 days, meaning in five more days that bear market would have been over.  


So if Bitcoin does put in a new low more than five days from now, then it would actually be the longest bear market that we‚Äôve ever had in Bitcoin‚Äôs history.  


But right now it‚Äôs the second-longest bear market if this (\~$15,500) is low.‚Äù

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Bitcoin (BTC) Analysis - Where does the pain stop?,"Over the past week, BTC has systematically fallen through support levels.

We are likely to see a relief rally sometime this week, as the 4H and Daily charts look ready for a bounce. On the weekly, it looks like there is some room to continue dipping before a true bottom is found.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,The market bottom is already in? | BTC Price Analysis,"Glassnode data shows that BTC holders have not given up or lost conviction. Coin days destroyed ‚Äì an indicator that measures holders‚Äô capitulation ‚Äì has reached an all time low. This means coins are more dormant than they have ever been. 

It‚Äôs worth noting that all previous examples of CDD being this high were *after* bear market bottoms were formed. This was the case in 2011, 2015, and 2019. Could this be another signal that the market bottom is already in? 

Bullish divergence on the 4H and Daily charts are a glimmer of hope for BTC. Investor sentiment remains extremely fearful, and fundamentals remain strong for BTC. It seems likely that BTC will continue grinding upward ‚Äì with periods of consolidation ‚Äì for the next few weeks. Current break above $20k would likely send BTC up to retest the 200w SMA at $23k, which would be a key level to watch.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,BTC miners start most aggressive selling in years.,"In the past three weeks, since the first rumors of FTX/Alameda's insolvency, Bitcoin (BTC) miners increased their selling pressure by 400%. This metric spiked to levels unseen since the bottom of the 2015 cycle. Mr. Edwards is certain that, if BTC's price fails to recover in the coming weeks, a lot of miners will be forced to stop operating due to heavy losses.  


Also, this painful period signals that BTC mining cannot be considered ""passive income"" any longer. Miners should reconsider their strategies to avoid finding themselves underwater: What we are seeing is not sustainable.  


Mine-and-hold is not a viable strategy for a Bitcoin miner. Miners are paying the consequences of the ""never selling"" arrogance widespread just 6 months ago.   
 

 Meanwhile, as covered by U.Today previously, both difficulty and hash rate, the two most important metrics of Bitcoin (BTC) mining activity, set new historic highs in mid-November.   


GameFi (Axie, God's Infinity, CosmoGene, and new projects like LifeBeyond), DeFi, and XRP seem to be holding on which is beyond great in this situation however BTC is still struggling and will probably continue for some time.  
 

Yesterday's adjustment pushed Bitcoin (BTC) mining difficulty over 36,95 T, while the hash rate almost reached the impressive level of 300 EH/s. Such an imbalance between BTC miner activity and profits should be attributed to whales' secret energy sources.",13,2022-11-22 23:53:05,2
BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,How bad the FOMC meeting will affect the price? | BTC Price Analysis,"Markets of all types have been significantly influenced by the actions of the United States Federal Reserve, which is set to meet again this week to hike interest rates once again. It is expected to see another 75bp hike. These hikes have typically sent markets reeling in the following days/weeks. While much of the fear is already priced in, recent trends may hold. This aligns well with the bearish indicators we are seeing on the charts, raising the likelihood of further consolidation before the market rally we are waiting for finally materializes. 

The 4H and Daily both look bearish, and potential rejections off of key price levels may be forming on the daily and weekly. It will be important for BTC to close the next few days above the key $21.9k price level, and the week above $22.8k in order for bullish narratives to resume. With the FOMC meeting this week, it is likely we will see markets sell-off in the short term, pairing up with what we are seeing on the charts. If BTC manages to hold above the $20k level despite market turmoil, it has a good chance to regain momentum in the coming weeks for a late summer / early fall market rally.

Let‚Äôs look at the [charts](https://t.me/midas_announcements/752) to get into more detail.

**Support Zones**:

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Consolidation or Grinding Lower? | BTC Price Analysis,"BTC has taken a beating over the past week after rejecting off of the 200W sma last week. This came after a worse-than-expected CPI reading last week set markets tumbling, and expectations of a higher rate hike in this week‚Äôs FOMC meeting. Poor macro economics continue to lead all markets lower. At time of writing, BTC is bouncing of lows in the low $18k range, reclaiming $19k and printing the largest green candle of the week. Is this a dead cat bounce, or has BTC regained some footing?

Key to all markets is the FOMC decision on the 21st. If they announce another 75bp hike, it will be neutral or slightly bullish for BTC, as this is already priced in. If a 100bp hike is announced, it will be more red candles. Markets are currently predicting an 86% chance of 75bp, and 14% chance of 100bp. 

Bitcon‚Äôs network hash rate has reached a new all time high. Despite miner revenues declining, the network continues to gain strength. At one point, hash rate was correlated strongly with the price. That correlation has seemingly broken throughout this downtrend.

BTC is oversold on the 4H chart, but the daily and weekly charts are looking grim. With the FOMC meeting looming and persistent inflation, macroeconomic headwinds continue to buffet BTC and other risk markets. BTC seems to have found local support around the $18.5k zone, but further consolidation and/or grinding lower is the most likely scenario for the medium term. 

**Support Zones**:

[BTC Range chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/QHuX83ww/)

As long as BTC is within this purple range, I am not placing trades. Simply prepping for when the range is broken. My confirmation for the range breaking with be a 1-4hr candle close outside of the range. The second I get that candle close it's time to place some trades as the market has decided it's next trending direction. 

We should always have an assortment of longs and shorts prepared, and here are just a couple of mine. It's important to note I trade support and resistance very heavily. So when the btc range breaks (higher or lower), these altcoins MUST also be showing a similar break on their representative support and resistance lines. I will not include much description for these since I think the charts explain themselves, but I am happy to answer questions if there are any.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"BTC, ETH, and BNB | Market Current Trends","#  Bitcoin Price Analysis

After failing to break resistance near $21.5k last week, BTC has retraced to the 4H 50SMA where it is now finding support. A bounce upward from here would confirm this rising support level. There is also a clear bullish divergence here as the moving averages are all in a bullish configuration. Support below $20.7k will be found at the 4H 100 SMA, priced around $20.4k.

Moving averages on the daily chart are still bearish, but a bullish divergence can be seen as BTC has broken above the 50 and 100SMA‚Äôs. The current pullback is to confirm the 100SMA as support, priced right around $20.64k. This support converges with the 4H support we identified above. A bounce here would be a clear case of resistance ‚Äì turned support, which is bullish. The next resistance is at the 200SMA, priced at just under $24k.

BTC is continuing to grind upward on the weekly chart. It needs to break above the 200w SMA, also priced at just under $24k, in order to truly regain bullish momentum. This major resistance coincides with daily resistance levels ‚Äì making it a strong resistance zone. It is unlikely that this resistance will break on the first attempt ‚Äì meaning the most likely outcome is a continued consolidation pattern in this zone for weeks to come as BTC gains strength.

# Ethereum Price Analysis

We will focus on ETH‚Äôs daily chart and fundamentals today. ETH is consolidating between the 100SMA and 200 SMA. The 100SMA has acted as strong support around $1500 while the 200 has acted as resistance just above $1600. This is a tightening range and ETH must choose a direction in the coming days. Support below is at $1400, while resistance above is around $1900-2k ( previous high).

ETH‚Äôs supply has expanded since the merge at an extremely small pace of 0.018% per year. This means that, even at the incredibly low network usage, nearly all emissions are being burned as transaction fees. If the market regains any momentum, the increase in gas will make ETH go net deflationary. Over a long period of time, this is incredibly bullish for ETH as the supply essentially has reached a soft cap.

# BNB Price Analysis

BNB has been incredibly strong in recent weeks, with daily moving averages about to form a golden cross. Clear bullish divergence is also seen, with BNB breaking all resistances including the prior high set in August. This is majorly bullish for BNB as it has been outperforming the market by a wide margin.

BNB is currently pulling back after a major run upward. The previous high of around $330 will act as support and is being tested now. Below this, the 100SMA is support at $291.

We can see from BNB‚Äôs momentum indicators that the move up caused it to become heavily overbought. The pullback to support is a healthy one, and should not be cause for concern unless BNB falls below $290.

# Market Sentiment

Investors are becoming less fearful as markets range sideways. This shows a rising level of optimism, which could potentially backfire. Still, the market is more fearful than greedy at this stage. Once again the most likely outcome here is consolidation.

# Conclusion

Crypto markets are in a short-term pullback to confirm higher support zones. If these zones hold, it is bullish as markets will likely then enter a pattern of consolidation in these higher zones. BNB has been strongly outperforming the market and is strong above $290. Market fundamentals continue to improve for BTC and ETH, and investor sentiment is slowly turning more positive. So long as support holds and we have no black swans, consolidation and grinding upward is likely.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,What is BTC‚Äôs next move? | Price Analysis,"Crypto firms and funds have been unwinding, adding fuel to the fire as the market tanks. Luna, Celcius, and now 3AC have all collapsed over the past month and increased the downward pressure on BTC‚Äôs price. However, a glimmer of hope is present as exchanges like Binance made large BTC purchases over the weekend when BTC hit the $17.7k mark. Reports have surfaced that Binance spent $2B buying up cheap BTC, helping the market to form a bottom.

Over the weekend Bitcoin found a local bottom at the $17.7k mark before rebounding back above the $20k mark at the weekly close. While we may see a slowdown in the short term (as indicated on the 4H chart), the daily and weekly charts look absolutely primed for a relief rally. In all likelihood, this relief rally will take BTC past the weekly 200SMA ‚Äì a bullish signal for traders and algos alike. With euphoric bearish sentiment, it seems to be a good time to begin DCA‚Äôing into new long positions. 

Let‚Äôs look at the [charts](https://midas.best/bitcoinbearmarket) to get into more detail.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,There are signs that BTC is bottoming out.,"Bitcoin‚Äôs price has surged toward $17K, charting an increase of 5% for the week and 2.5% for the day. This happens as an important historic sign flashes again and is usually the precursor for appropriate accumulation spots and cyclical bottoms.  
 

This also pushed the entire cryptocurrency market, and its capitalization added some $17 billion over the same period.  
An analyst from CryptoQuant pointed out that the market has reached a critical point where there‚Äôs an intersection between the supply in loss and the supply in profit ‚Äì something that happens historically near cycle bottoms.  
Over nearly 13 years, with four cycles, we have all noticed an area of intersection between supply in loss and profit every time the price is in the bottom zone. Even in the early stages, when Bitcoin was valued at only a few dollars, this existed.  


It seems that there is an equilibrium rule that has run for more than a decade.  


GameFi (Axie, God's Infinity, CosmoGene, and new projects like LifeBeyond), DeFi, and XRP seem to be holding on which is beyond great in this situation however BTC is still struggling and will probably continue for some time but any good news like these are welcome.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Binance Price Analysis | Performing Better Than BTC,"At time of writing, BNB is trading around $275. Despite the recent dump, BNB is still trading up about 5% over the week. Will BNB‚Äôs slow grind upward continue?

BNB‚Äôs daily moving averages have switched into the neutral configuration, with the 50SMA rising above the 100. BNB attempted to form bullish divergence and rise above the 50 SMA this week, but was rejected. This key resistance is also in the $294 zone, which correlates with resistance we identified on the 4H chart. 

Support is below at the 100SMA at $268, which also correlates with our previously identified support zone. 

If BNB breaks above the daily 200SMA it could signal the start of a new bull run. This key level is at $320. 

On the daily chart, BNB‚Äôs momentum looks neutral and primed for consolidation. The RSI is neutral but Stochastic is trending down with the sideways price action. If the $268 support area does hold, this could turn bullish as the stochastic resets. 

The weekly chart looks similar to the daily. RSI is neutral and Stochastic is at the top of its range and has begun to descend. BNB needs to hold support levels and consolidate sideways to gather strength before a move upward. Key support at the weekly 200SMA has not been touched throughout the bear market. This level is at $174. 

## Conclusion

BNB is holding up well despite the turbulent market. It has performed better than BTC and other top alts. Moving averages are beginning to look neutral, but sideways consolidation is needed to gather strength. It is important for BNB to hold above the support zone of $268-270.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,As inflation decreases BTC rises.,"The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.1% in November from the month prior, slowing more than expected from October‚Äôs 0.4% pace, in a sign of progress in the Federal Reserve's campaign to bring down soaring inflation.  


On an annual basis, the CPI rose 7.1%, the U.S. Labor Department reported Tuesday, below the 7.3% projected by economists in a FactSet survey.  
Bitcoin (BTC), which has been relatively steady so far in December, jumped 2% in the minutes after the report was released, to about $17,930.  


Traders have been monitoring the data for signs of whether the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest-rate hikes this year are helping to bring down the pace of consumer-price increases, which earlier this year hit a four-decade high. In general, the tighter monetary policy puts downward pressure on the prices of risky assets, from stocks to cryptocurrencies.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Support levels are likely to hold? | BTC Price Analysis,"One thing working in BTC‚Äôs favor is that investor sentiment is back to ‚ÄúExtreme Fear‚Äù ‚Äì signaling that the market is heavy on shorts and FUD is priced in. Important to note, however, is that there is still more room to fall for the ‚ÄúExtreme Fear‚Äù to become even more extreme. Readings below 10 tend to signal pico bottoms. One major points of FUD over the last few weeks was that 140k BTC would be released from Mt. Gox at the end of August ‚Äì a number that dwarfs the TFL dump in May and would send BTC tumbling further. These claims were dismissed by Mt. Gox creditors. Typically, times of extreme fear and FUD present great buying opportunities, and usually the FUD is overhyped or made up entirely. 

Bitcoin‚Äôs network has actually been gaining total hash rate despite the market turndown, signaling fundamental strength. 

Generally speaking, BTC has been moving inversely with the DXY (the dollar index) which has been on a parabolic bull run over the past several months. The DXY is currently at a major resistance point at 109.3, where it topped in June. If it tops again here and is rejected, it forms a bearish double top pattern, which would probably mean the bottom is also in for BTC. It will be important to watch the DXY in the coming days and weeks. 

The recent short squeeze has made BTC overbought on the short term, signaling another impending dump back to support zones. The daily chart, however, looks heavily oversold ‚Äì so these support levels are likely to hold (at least for the medium term). The weekly chart appears to be losing steam, but with the RSI so close to oversold, it‚Äôs unlikely that the $17.6k bottom set in June will break ‚Äì barring some unforeseen global black swan event.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,BTC Market Structure Changing - What to watch for,"[Current BTC 4hr chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WniQrhtr)

Understanding price action and market structure is one of the most valuable concepts in terms of keeping your head straight in this market. Bitcoin recently printing a couple signs of changing market structure and I wanted to share because sometimes this stuff is almost too simple that people overlook it.

The chart above is showing that after the enormous BTC drop in November, we started to print some higher highs and higher lows. In other terms, the 4hr chart was showing a bullish uptrend. This uptrend is shown by the orange line on the chart. All of this is great and wonderful, but this is where things start to change. 

About a week ago, BTC price action pushed through this uptrend and closed a strong bearish candle. This was our first sign that something in the structure/trend is changing. This is an important thing, so I'll repeat it; The price action breaking through the orange trend line DOES NOT mean the market is reversing but it's a great warning sign that it's time to pay attention and be cautious with trades. This price action continued to drop far enough that we have already printed a lower low, which is also marked on the chart. And yet again, this does not mean that the market is reversed and going down, but that it's time to pay close attention to the price action coming up.

So the question is what's next? That is impossible to predict perfectly, but I'd like to share what is incredibly possible using similar market structure and ideas:

[Projected 4hr BTC chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/bG20jpJi)

If the market structure is actually changing like the warning signs have been saying, then it's fair to expect a lower high to be printed as the market moves in waves. The question is simply where to expect a lower high. It can occur anywhere, but what I have marked on the chart is what I would consider to be a highly likely area for a lower high. This would be retesting a level of strong resistance for BTC. This also overlaps nicely with the Fibonacci golden pocket retracement that BTC loves to follow. That's really all there is to it, just support and a couple Fibonacci levels. This may change as more data comes in the next couple weeks but this is on my radar right now.

Happy trading! And keep an eye out for a lower high in the near future!

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Texas became a hub for BTC because of Ted Cruz.,"United States Senator Ted Cruz wants to make the American state of Texas an oasis for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Speaking at the Texas Blockchain Summit 2022 in late November, the politician empathized with how the crypto industry can be strategic for the U.S. energy supply and technological development.   


Cruz argued that Bitcoin mining could be used to monetize energy created from oil and gas extraction, rather than burning it. In addition, he emphasized how mining activity can be used as an energy storage and supply alternative.  


The Senator highlighted that Texas combines abundant and relatively low-cost energy, as well as embracing free enterprise, which makes Texas an attractive state for crypto industry development in the US. Cruz also unveiled the reason why he described himself as an enthusiastic fan of Bitcoin.  


Texas is one of the fastest-growing crypto mining hubs in the United States. In August, its Comptroller's office revealed the state's pro-crypto stance, intending to host long-term miners and operators in a newsletter.

At the time of publishing, BTC is trading around $16.4k and is up 3.7% from 7 days ago, ETH is sitting just over $1200 and is up 9% on the week, and BNB crossed $300 and is up a whopping 18% since last week. Could such a strong bounce after capitulation signal that the bottom is in?¬†

**Bitcoin Price Analysis**

BTC is showing some bullish divergence on the 4H chart, as the price has crossed above the 50SMA and held it as support upon multiple retests. This support level is currently being tested at $16.35k. We can also see that BTC has been moving in a tightening range, trading between the 50SMA support and 100SMA resistance. This resistance is currently priced at $16.5k. Above this, the 200SMA is much higher at $18.1k.¬†

On the daily chart, BTC is still sitting well below all moving averages. From a momentum perspective, the RSI is now in neutral territory ‚Äì but the Stochastic is now overbought. This could signal that bullish momentum may stall in the medium-term and BTC may continue to consolidate in this lower range.¬†

BTC‚Äôs long term chart is showing signs of being oversold ‚Äì signaling that downward momentum is likely over. The RSI is oversold and Stochastic has reached the bottom of its range. This is similar to its chart from June ‚Äì which led to months of sideways consolidation. The nearest moving average is the weekly 300 SMA, which will act as resistance, priced at $18.1k.¬†

**Ethereum Price Analysis**

ETH is showing similar bullish divergences to BTC, but slightly stronger. Here on ETH‚Äôs 4H chart, ETH has broken above both 50 and 100SMA‚Äôs, and is now retesting the 100SMA as support. The 100SMA is priced just under $1200. Above this is the 200SMA at $1350.

On ETH‚Äôs long term chart, the asset is looking very strong. Holding higher lows from the summer, trading just below the 200SMA, and an oversold Stochastic bode well for ETH in the coming weeks. There is support at $1200, $1k, and $880, and resistance at $1350 (200SMA).¬†

**BNB Price Analysis**

BNB is looking like the strongest crypto asset recently. Its price has rocketed through all local resistances (50, 100, and 200 SMA‚Äôs), and is now testing the 200SMA as support at $300. Holding this support would be a classic resistance turned support bullish flip, and sets up a golden cross opportunity in the coming days/weeks. Below the $300 support is the 50SMA at $292.¬†

BNB has held well above its weekly 200SMA throughout the bear market, showing incredible relative strength when compared to other crypto assets. Its RSI remains neutral despite the uptrend, and we can see that the 50SMA is acting as resistance ‚Äì currently priced at $335.

**Market Sentiment**

The FGI is still very fearful, but is sitting one point out of the ‚Äúextreme fear‚Äù range. This comes despite analysts calling for $12k or lower, and major uncertainty surrounding continued FTX fallout, GBTC and WBTC worries, and regulation risk.

**Fundamental Analysis**

Glassnode reported this week that small-to-medium BTC investors (up to 10BTC) have increased their on-chain holdings by nearly 300k BTC over the past month since the FTX fallout. This shows that investor confidence in the sector remains very strong, people are buying the dip, and decentralization is increasing ‚Äì all positive signals.¬†

BTC‚Äôs hash rate has declined by about 15% following the recent sell off. This comes as Bitcoin mining companies are forced to turn off their mining machines. It also comes as Glassnode reports miners selling BTC from their treasuries to cover costs. While a lower hash rate is not good for BTC in the long term, it means that the miner capitulation risk has already occurred and is priced in.¬†

**Conclusion**

Crypto markets are showing signs of resilience despite incredibly difficult conditions. With bullish divergences for all three major crypto assets, it seems the worst is over ‚Äì at least for now. Many analysts are calling for $12k (or lower) BTC, but it would take some serious catalysts to push the price lower. Especially with so many investors buying and accumulating coins. HODL and BTFD conviction remains strong. Fearful conditions persist, presenting a fantastic buying opportunity.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,The Worst Is Over? | BTC Price Analysis,"Glassnode reported in their new weekly on-chain analysis that futures volume shows that BTC markets are stabilizing following the Luna collapse. While futures and options pricing does not show a strong bullish bias yet, it does show that investors are willing to take on moderate amounts of price exposure. Markets are now showing negligible bias in either bullish or bearish directions.

The 4H chart looks primed for a pullback or consolidation, while the daily and weekly look bullish. Investor sentiment remains fearful, which is slightly bullish, and fundamentals are neutral. This sets the stage for a neutral / bullish tilt in the short term, while retaining bullish biases in the long term. BTC holding above the 200 weekly SMA is very bullish, and suggests that the worst is over. 

Let‚Äôs look at the [charts](https://t.me/midas_announcements/773) to get into more detail.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Bulls are Driving the Market Green | BTC Price Analysis,"Glassnode reported in their weekly on-chain BTC analysis that BTC is beginning to test its realized price ‚Äì another key market indicator that could signal the end of the bear market. In its history, BTC has only traded below its realized price at its deepest bear depth. This could mean that the worst is over. 

BTC is breaking important resistances and setting up new support zones on the 4H, and is testing a key price point in the weekly (200 SMA). With a confluence of resistances around the key area of $22.6-22.7k, I do not expect BTC to break resistance upon the first attempt. However, a key indicator to watch is if BTC breaks and holds above the $22.7k mark on the weekly chart.

The majority of you joined the scene around the beginning of 2021. Many old investors relied on you for liquidity. Even so, we're still holding steady in the 38-40k range.  


And the fact that this price range is being referred to as a bear market makes me incredibly bullish.   


You guys need to look back in time and examine what is genuinely sensible. A true bear market would be below $10k. The 40k level is incredibly bullish.  


So, instead of being pessimistic, learn to cherish the dips and corrections. If you actually believe in Bitcoin, you'll be stacking like crazy. Also try to appreciate small projects if your goal is to moonshot, my current moonshots are projects like ROSE or Crayon.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Back To 20k? | BTC Price Analysis,"Despite  last week‚Äôs dump and poor price TA, investor sentiment has not yet  returned to extreme fear. This signals that there is more pain to be  found before a bounce could occur. Typically we wait for sentiment to  hit extremes before taking a contrarian position.

Glassnode  reported last week that BTC broke below the realized price level of  $21.7k last week, signaling that the market is in an aggregate loss. The  $21.7k mark is a key level for BTC to reclaim.

Bitcoin‚Äôs  total hash rate has stabilized above the 200 TH/s over recent weeks,  showing that the network has recalibrated to the new price level.  Typically large declines in hash rate correspond with large price  corrections.

With bear flags  forming on the 4H and weekly charts, a pending death cross, and the loss  of key price levels, things are not looking good for BTC in the  short/medium term. A retrace to the psychological $20k level looks  likely in the coming days/weeks, as momentum indicators need to reset  and consolidate before any bullish momentum can be regained.  Fundamentals look shaky, and a global economy on the edge of recession  spells future pain for BTC. Good times will come again, but there will  be buying opportunities along the way.

**Support Zones**:

* $20k (psychological)
* $17.6k (previous bottom)

**Resistance Zones**

* $21.7k (realized price)
* $23.1k (200w SMA)

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,BTC ideas going into the weekend,"*This is tailored toward traders and only traders, it will not apply to anyone that has a hodl-based strategy.*

Some basic BTC ideas going into the weekend. 

* The descending triangle should break lower
* The rising wedge should break lower
* The descending triangle lower support was regained but with low volume
* If the descending triangle support is lost again, watch for a retest and then a most to the range lows (could be lower than the $27k level I have marked)

Once of my favorite strategies recently has been trading the bull and bear traps. It's one of the highest success rate trading methods I use, it just doesn't happen very frequently being that it is always against the probability. But this idea is shown on the chart with the blue area. On a retest of range higher is where I will be loading with longs, until then just short term trading.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Could this be the bottom for BTC?,"It's apparent that bullish signals have formed for bitcoin, implying that the price will continue to rise toward the widely followed 200-day simple moving average (SMA). BTC has grown from $38,500 to $42,200 in the last three days, according to the daily chart. Positive indications from technical instruments like stochastics and MACD (moving average convergence/divergence) histograms support the recent bullish defense, in my opinion.

Bitcoin has held key cloud-based support at $40,000, and the daily stochastics have formed an oversold 'buy' signal following a three-day gain, indicating a short-term bullish bias.

For those unfamiliar, stochastics are technical analysis indicators that swing between 0 and 100, allowing traders to spot oversold and overbought circumstances as well as trade entry and exit positions. When stochastics fall below 20, an asset is deemed oversold, and when they rise beyond 80, it is called overbought. A move upward from below 20 is considered a buy signal.

The 200-day SMA of $48,000 has come into view as a result of the three-day rally. The average proved difficult to overcome in late March, delaying the rebound rally from lows near $37,500. On the downside, the sellers must break through Monday's low of $38,550.¬†According to CoinDesk statistics, Bitcoin was recently trading near $42,300, signifying a 2% rise for the day.

I am not sure how things will unfold, but my decision, for now, is to trade assets to BTC from USDT and BEAN (beanstalk), which I honestly think is going to recover from an unfortunate event, cause I still believe in their concept. What's your decision so far?",11,2022-04-21 19:20:16,5

* üíµ **3% Auto Liquidity -** This is used to consistently increase the base amount of liquidity in the coins LP Holdings. This helps the coin grow in value with every transaction.
* üî• **1% Burn -** After every transaction, 1% of the total amount transacted will be permanently removed from the total supply. This deflationary effect on the supply will create a constant and steady increase in the individual tokens value.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Mine BTC Every Hour With Using Pionex Bot,"You can just set up a grid bot on ETH/BTC and let the bot keep scalping 24/7. It will keep ""mining"" Bitcoins from the volatility. The BTC/USD and ETH/USD price are pretty relevant to each other. Most of the time, when BTC goes up, ETH will follow; when BTC is goes down, ETH will follow as well. But they are not going up or down at the same pace. Therefore, if you does not attach much importance to instant prices, if you are maximalist for btc and eth in the long run. Pionex btc/eth bot can help you reach your goal. You can also release your earnings and add them to your initial investment.  This gives you compound earnings.",1,2022-09-03 19:09:58,1
BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,What Bullish Catalyst Can There Be? | BTC Price Analysis,"Glassnode published an analysis this past week showing that this BTC bear is one of the most significant in history. With the price falling below BTC‚Äôs realized value, the Mayer multiple trading at historic lows, and the price dipping to the weekly 200SMA, the bottom could be in. However, a pessimistic outlook could see BTC dip as low as $13k. 

BTC looks neutral on the 4H and Daily, but heavily oversold on the weekly. Any bullish catalyst should send BTC on a massive relief rally. According to Glassnode data, BTC is currently trading at a major recovery zone and should have significant support in the newly established $17-20k range. Resistance is nearby at $22k. Improving global macro thanks to sliding energy prices could be the catalyst BTC needs to finally rally. TBD. 

Let‚Äôs look at the [charts](https://midas.best/btcpriceanalysis) to get into more detail.

**Support Zones**: 

* $17.5k (range)
* $20k
* $20.7k (4H 50SMA)

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Hold Rocket Raccoon and get 10% reward in BTC for each transaction, paid hourly !","üí°How Rocket Raccoon Works?

Rocket Raccoon brings a new twist to "" Hold and Take "" . When you hold 25 billion Rocket Raccoon ($1000 at current price), 12% of each transaction will automatically convert to Bitcoin.

*If you don't have enough 25 Billion, don't worry, you can use ROC to stake and join IDO ( this feature is in testing now).*

‚úÖ 10% of each transaction is redistributed to ROC holders. That means you can earn BTC just by holding them in your wallet.

‚úÖ 2% on each trade will automatically add to liquidity

‚úÖ 2% of ¬†transaction will automatically add to the Marketing Wallet

üí°How much I get for holding 25B?

It depends on daily transaction volume.

For example, with 1M volume, 10%= $100,000 is convert to BTC and pay for holders who hold at least 25B ROC.

The total supply is 100,000 B -> got that $100,000.

=> **25B ROC got (25B\*100,000)/100,000B = $25 PER DAY, PAID HOURLY with 1M volume.**

If volume is 5M, we get 5\*25= $125 per day. ( This volume we achieved 3 days ago)

If volume is 10M, we get 10\*25 = $250 per day.

(actually, we get more because 20% of total supply was burnt)

üí°IS CODE AUDITED?

YES. [https://github.com/interfinetwork/smart-contract-audits/blob/main/RocketRaccoon\_AuditReport\_InterFi.pdf](https://github.com/interfinetwork/smart-contract-audits/blob/main/RocketRaccoon_AuditReport_InterFi.pdf)

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Bitcoin (BTC) Analysis - What's the next move?,"For the past several months, BTC has been tracking the Nasdaq index ‚Äì essentially trading as a tech stock. This past week, BTC has decoupled from its correlation with QQQ, but not in the positive way most were expecting. Many analysts have been calling for a relief rally in traditional markets ‚Äì which indeed materialized this past week. QQQ rose 6.5% over the last trading week, but Bitcoin was left trading flat or down. This shows a fundamental weakness for BTC. If traditional stock markets experience a sell off this week, BTC could also sell off ‚Äì sending it to a lower low. Traders should take positions with extreme caution. 

Technical indicators look bearish on the Daily timeframe. On the weekly, RSI is still looking heavily oversold and stochastic is reaching the bottom of its range. We could see a slight relief rally, but the RSI may still go lower as it did in the 2018/19 bear market during its final capitulation.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Do you think BTC is one of the technically worst cryptos?,"Cyber ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãCapital Cryptocurrency Fund founder and chief investment officer Justin Bons called Bitcoin (BTC) ""technically one of the worst cryptocurrencies"" and a ""purely speculative asset with no use"" compared to other cryptocurrencies due to a lack of technological progress.

Commenting on his sentiment in an 11-part Twitter thread on Sunday, Bons said bitcoin's value proposition has been deteriorating over the long term due to a broken long-term security model, relatively weak economic features and a lack of capabilities, programmability and compounding.

Bons has been a prominent figure in the crypto community for several years, in 2016 he founded one of Europe's oldest cryptocurrency funds, Cyber ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãCapital, and since 2014 he is considered a full-time cryptocurrency researcher. In addition, Bons operates nodes on the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash networks.

Justin Bons said he vigorously defended BTC in 2014, saying that ""the reality is that BTC has changed dramatically since then,"" while the decision not to increase the block size limit is a serious departure from the original vision and purpose.

Even though I myself haven't been involved with bitcoin for a while and am more interested in blockchain finance like Aave, Ovenue, etc, I never thought that bitcoin was worse than any cryptocurrency or any form of blockchain, rather the opposite, so I found these notes  quite difficult to estimate.

What is your opinion, do you share the views of this man?",1,2022-09-11 20:53:25,0

Glassnode reports that Bitcoin‚Äôs supply is becoming increasingly illiquid. If this continues, a sell-side liquidity crisis is forming that could send BTC‚Äôs price skyrocketing. These are the foundations of the next bull market forming right in front of us. 

Fundamentals are strong and the sentiment is down, which are long-term bullish indicators. Short-term price action (4H) looks bearish, while daily looks bullish and weekly looks neutral/bullish. Bitcoin can continue consolidating, possibly wicking down to low supports before bouncing back into consolidation zone.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Central African Republic adopts BTC as a legal currency.,"The Central African Republic's president's office announced Wednesday that bitcoin has been approved as legal currency, making it the world's second country to do so after El Salvador. This might result in a BTC pump, but I'm sticking to my diversification plan, focusing first on fresh projects like Crayon or QREDO.  


President Faustin Archange Touadera signed the bill into law after lawmakers overwhelmingly approved it, making bitcoin legal money alongside the CFA franc and legalizing the usage of cryptocurrencies, according to his chief of staff Obed Namsio.  


According to Namsio, the CAR is ""the first country in Africa to use bitcoin as legal money.""  


""With this step, the Central African Republic joins the ranks of the world's most daring and imaginative nations,"" he remarked.  


The landlocked country is one of the world's poorest and most problematic countries, with a mining-dependent economy.  


On September 7, El Salvador became the world's first bitcoin adopter.  


Citizens of the Central American country were permitted to use the digital currency to pay for any item or service using a cyber wallet software, alongside the US dollar, which has been the official currency for the past two decades.  


The International Monetary Fund (IMF) criticized the introduction (IMF).  


It warned of ""significant risks associated with bitcoin's use on financial stability, financial integrity, and consumer protection,"" as well as the risks of issuing bitcoin-backed bonds.",10,2022-04-27 18:58:08,2

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Bitcoin On-Chain Analysis: Supply in Profit Holds Support; Danger of BTC Capitulation?," As of 2022, the Supply in Profit indicator, which measures what percentage of BTC supply in circulation is currently recording a profit has not fallen below the 62.5% level. This year, it has bounced off the key support area three times, on Jan. 22, Feb. 21, and March 13, corresponding with local BTC price lows at $34,000, $36,350, and $37,555.  Currently, the indicator shows 67.1% and is in a short-term uptrend, as is Bitcoin‚Äôs price. Interestingly, the BTC price has reached the lower range of a rising channel, recording a bottom at $39,200 on April 11.  On a long-term basis, we see that Supply in Profit has been above the 62.5% level since April 2020.   
 We saw a similar situation during the bull market of 2012-2013, where the 62.5% area also served as support, and BTC never breached it.  Upon further analysis, the indicator illustrates that the risk of capitulation in the Bitcoin market is still real.   
  The Long-Term Holder Capitulation Signal, another metric that shows where the BTC price drop was impacted by sell-offs from long-term holders also predicts imminent capitulation.  Throughout Bitcoin‚Äôs history, this indicator has been below the 0 level four times, demonstrating a deepening bear market, which served as advantageous opportunities to buy Bitcoin.  BTC is expected to enter the capitulation stage, where it may consolidate for a while,  and then begin its upward trajectory. When that happens, fundamentally sound protocols like Nature's Vault, Polygon, and Cosmos among others will recover the quickest.  In conclusion, if the price of BTC steeply declines in the coming days, do not panic. Instead, seize the opportunity.",1,2022-04-18 20:03:34,3

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,"Will BTC rebound from the 37,500$ level or will it continue its bearish movement?","According to what I've seen, BTC has risen beyond $40,000, the midpoint of its three-month price range. The cryptocurrency does, however, face early resistance above $43,500, which might stop the recent price rise. At press time, BTC was trading at roughly $41,200, up 5% in the last 24 hours.

The reality is that the RSI on intraday charts is reaching overbought levels, as it did in late March, which signaled a market fall. However, the RSI is neutral on the daily chart, indicating that buyers may continue to be active at support.

For now, BTC is holding support above $37,500, a critical milestone that has kept the rebound on track. Furthermore, since the 24th of January, a succession of higher price lows has shown a reduction in selling pressure, but with price swings of 20%.

The weekly chart's momentum indications are still bullish, pointing to more upside toward the $46,710 resistance level in the intermediate-term.

My choice is to wait for BTC to reach the 37,500$ level before converting my USDT and BEAN (which I think will recover from their disastrous situation and regain popularity) to BTC. What are your opinions on recent market movements, and have you added to your BTC holdings?",6,2022-04-19 19:53:00,2
BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Bitcoin (BTC) Analysis - Weekly Update,"Bitcoin seems to be making a break upward. The daily close over the next few days will be critical to see if the $40k zone can hold as support. A bullish divergence RSI pattern is forming, with fractals showing the same pattern on both low and high time frames. Strong accumulation patterns and reduction in sell pressure confirm this bullish bias. 

Let‚Äôs look at the [charts](https://t.me/midas_announcements/523) and try to identify trends for the week.

BTC,CryptoCurrencyTrading,Bitcoin (BTC) Analysis - Weekly Update,"BTC‚Äôs strong fundamentals continue, and price action is looking increasingly bullish. On low timeframes (such as the 4H and Daily) it looks like BTC may need a pullback to confirm local support before continuing. On the weekly, BTC looks ready to rocket. If the $45.6k zone holds, this appears to be the beginning of a new bull market.

Let‚Äôs look at the [charts](https://t.me/midas_announcements/572) and try to identify trends for the week.

\#1. To those stating the wallet address that sends the last transaction to the Binance cold wallet:

The ""As"" at the end of this address was unintentional and was supposed to be spaced to continue my sentence.

\#2. To those stating that a Binance cold wallet can be a long-standing wallet holding assets from trades on Binance, now in posession of Binance‚Äî Cold wallets can always be bestowed to user's on Binance so it's 50/50. However, the fact that the final amount is pretty close to the amount we started with suggests Point A to Point B via multiple meaningless transactions.

\#3. Someone caught this that opened up another can of worms:

The dates on the two amounts that clearly are involved in the initial 80,000 BTC reserve are different.

None of this is mentioned in the LFG tweets. Why is LFG sending BTC to OkEx and leaving this out of their explanation of events that transpired?  


*Fun fact: OkEx shut down service to South Korea due to harsh 20% tax regulations they didn't want to deal with on 04/07/2021.*

&#x200B;

Although we almost lost track of the transactions, we can now confirm OkEx exchange was involved. An Exchange that is no longer supported in South Korea unless you obviously don't disclose your identity and use a VPN. I have no doubt Do Kwon would NOT have an issue managing this but I'll leave it up to you guys to decide for yourselves.

From LFG Wallet and OkEx Exchange Address we can see that around 90K bitcoin found it's way to this Binance cold-wallet, which still has these funds at this moment.

50K Bitcoin from an OkEx exchange BTC address, and 41K from the Luna Foundation Guard wallet address.

[OKEx to Cease Operations in South Korea - BeInCrypto](https://beincrypto.com/okex-to-cease-operations-in-south-korea/)

https://preview.redd.it/qdy01oeoka091.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d8bc50f54c22f5ce7ec35404fff885e9f951d37

**TLDR: In noticing that we lost track of some of the funds from part 1 due to a date discrepancy, we were able to resolve the confirm the correct route the 90K bitcoin took to the Binance cold-wallet address. We now know that more than half of the BTC that is now in this cold-wallet is heavily tied to a wallet address on OkEx, which is banned in South Korea since 04/07/2021 due to consistent money-laundering issues observed by South Korean Financial Intelligence Units. Again, none of this was mentioned by Luna Guard Foundation. Why is BTC going to and from OkEx?**

BTC,Binance,Man sues Claro after losing his bitcoins on Binance,"A few months ago a resident of Brazil had more than USD 34,000 in bitcoin (BTC) stolen from his Binance account. But far from claiming against the platform, he filed a lawsuit against Claro, alleging that his chip was cloned.  

The case, which was reported by the Brazilian magazine LiveCoins, began in December last year when suddenly the Claro mobile line of the victim's cell phone stopped working. When this happened, the man complained to the customer service department. After a few days, he was given a new phone number in a physical store of the company. 

According to the investigation, a large part of the funds were mobilized to other blockchains to finance a couple of projects in pre-launch phase, mainly two, Equilibrium and Minosis Token.

But just when everything seemed to have settled, he realized something unexpected. The bitcoins he had in his Binance account were gone. He noticed that someone with a mobile device located in the city of Sao Paulo had cloned his chip and withdrawn all his funds from the cryptocurrency platform, which were more than USD 34,000 in BTC. 

He explains that his chip was cloned, enabled on another device and used to steal his bitcoins. He indicates that the hacker was able to access his Binance account through SMS password recovery enabled by the platform. 

This type of scam is known as SIM swapping or chip duplication. It consists of someone making a duplicate SIM card of the cell phone to receive the code sent by the platforms by SMS to confirm a transaction. In this way, the fraudster can enter your personal accounts and withdraw your money.

Faced with this situation, the user sued Claro in the Federal District Court of Justice in Brazil. He alleges that there was a failure in the provision of the service that caused great damage to the bitcoin investor. He asked the company to reimburse him USD 10,000 for moral damages. 

In response to the lawsuit, Claro denied the request claiming that it is not at fault for the fraud that occurred at Binance and asked to be excluded from the proceedings. However, the court judge disagreed with the company's statements and asked it to prove that it is not responsible for the failure to provide the service.  

Thus, the case is still open. Claro will have to prove that it did not facilitate the fraud, while Binance has not received any claims from the affected party. Although during the last year other users in Latin America, such as Colombia and Venezuela, have initiated legal action against the platform for different bitcoin losses reported by CriptoNoticias.  

This situation demonstrates the importance that cryptocurrency holders and traders should give to the security measures of their funds. As explained in Cryptopedia, it is always advisable to store cryptocurrencies in self-custody wallets outside exchanges to avoid situations like these.",93,2022-06-05 17:38:26,39
